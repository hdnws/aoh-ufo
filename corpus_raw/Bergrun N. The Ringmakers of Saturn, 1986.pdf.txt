Preface 

Presented  herein  are  pictures  of  immensely  large,  enormously  powerful 
extraterrestrial space vehicles located in the vicinity of Saturn and its moons. 
These  photographic  revelations  are  reinforced  by,  and  are  consistent  with, 
scientific  data  extending  over  centuries  as  far  back  as  Galileo.  The  pictures 
have  been  obtained  by  the  author  using  simple,  repeatable  enhancement 
techniques applied to publicly available NASA photographs from Voyager  1 
and  2  flybys  of  Saturn.  Having  been  obtained  by  pre-scheduled  flight 
programming, Voyager photographs are scientifically unique in that they are 
strictly  impersonal. 

Identification  of  extraterrestrial  vehicles,  apparently  possessing  ancient 
historical  presence  in  the  solar  system,  is  a  new  discovery  having  many 
ramifications.  Attention,  however,  is  focused  on  presenting  factual  infor-
mation  which  can  be  gleaned  from  the  pictures.  Cameras,  being  well-
established  scientific  instruments,  provide  direct  data  of  the  "Seeing-Is-
Believing"  variety.  Despite  their  straight-forward  characteristic,  actual 
photographs  probably  will  not  establish  conviction  for  everyone.  For 
example,  personal  beliefs  may  deleteriously  impair  the  communication 
process. Not withstanding this difficulty, effort has been exercised to enhance 
communication effectively through use of supplemental illustrations.  Burden-
ing  detail  of enhancement  methodology,  aerospace  equations  and  technical 
jargon  intentionally  has  been  omitted  to  favor  simple,  broadly  compre-
hensible  language. 

Considerable  technical  data  have  been  published  concerning  Voyagers  1 

and  2  on-board  instrumentation  results  during  the  Saturn flybys. Interpre-
tation  of  the  visual  data  presented  poses  no  conflict  with  data  from  other 
on-board  instrumentation.  In  fact,  all  data  are  mutually  compatible.  Inter-
estingly,  the  visual  data  stand  on  their  own  without  the  need  for  other 
measurements  redundantly  to  attest  to  the  accuracy  of  the  analysis.  A 
fundamental  attribute  of any  correct  analysis  is  that  it  supplies  answers  to  a 
wide spectrum of relevant questions. When the physical nature of a problem is 
understood, a predictive ability then ensues which enables achievement of new 
progress.  Such achievement can be expressed simply as a breakthrough. 

Magnitude of the  Saturnian  breakthrough would  appear to  be substantial. 
Saturnian space vehicles, strangely unusual in their great size and appearance, 
introduce  a  new  and  unpredictable  variable  into  affairs  world-wide.  Some 
hitherto  reported  events  are  recounted  in  terms  of vehicle  capabilities with  a 
view toward postulating some concept of what the future portends.  Compell-
ing reasons exist for obtaining a much more complete understanding of these 
vehicles and the inferential  superlative intelligence behind  them. 

Photographic enhancement  has  been  accomplished  by  enlarging negatives

with  a  microscope  having  recording  and  high-intensity  lighting  capabilities. 
Self-developing positive film recorded  the various  selected images contained 
in negatives. Copies of original photomicrographic recordings are the product 
of professional  film-processing  services. 

To recall, launch date for Voyager 1 is 5 September 1977 and for Voyager 2, 
20 August 1977. Date of closest approach to Saturn is 12 November 1980 for 
Voyager  1  and  26  August  1981  for  Voyager  2.  Without  photography  from 
these flybys, the science story presented herein could not be told.  Universality 
of interest  in  the  findings  renders  disclosures  singularly  through  discipline-
oriented  channels  inappropriate.  Further,  absence  of disciplinary-boundary 
constraints permits discussion of humanistic concerns relevant to the findings 
which  otherwise  would  be  omitted.  This  broad  approach  is  expected  to 
catalyze  more  readily  and  more  realistically  the  priorities  which  should  be 
given to the many, highly diverse,  aspects of the subject matter.

PART I 

IMPEDIMENTS  TO  PROGRESS 


================================================================
CHAPTER 1. Puzzlements  of Saturn 

Saturn  has  beguiled  observers  since  the  dawn  of recorded  history 
over  50 centuries  ago.  In  earliest  history,  Saturn  has  been  associated 
with  omens  concerning  both  political  and  daily  life.  This  situation 
changed  little  until  the  beginning  of  the  17th  century  when  Galileo  and 
his contemporaries, using telescopes, began systematic observations of 
Saturn. 

Seventeenth  century  observers  documented  a  variety  of shapes  for 
what  are  now  known  as  Saturn's  rings.  Galileo  himself pictured  the 
"rings" as solid circles, one on either side of the planet. Others pictured 
a solid elliptical ring plane, but one containing unusual openings such 
as  circles  and  diamond  shapes.  Absence  of  rings  also  is  recorded. 
Variance among observers and the uncommon appearance of the rings 
have been attributed to poor telescope quality in early days. 

Poor telescope quality also has been cited for the wide range in ring-
plane  thickness  documented  by  various  observers  later  in  the  18th 
century.  Reported  thicknesses  range  from  335  km (280 mi)  to  16 km 
(10  mi).  Whether  Saturn  had  any  rings  at  all  continued  to  be 
questioned  into  the  19th  century.  In  a  carefully  timed  observation,  a 
definitive shadow was expected to be cast on the ring plane by Saturn's 
moon,  Titan;  but no perceptible shadow ever occurred.  The  observer, 
W.  R.  Dawes,  carefully  concluded  in  1862  that  the  rings  must  be 
inconceivably  thin. 

Near the end of the  18th century, luminous points were observed on 
the edge of the ring plane. One of these is reported to have moved off its 
position.  None  of the  luminous  points  persisted  very  long  (less  than 
16 hours), thereby negating the possibility of their being satellites. The 
observer,  William  Herschel,  postulated  in  1789  that  some  sort  of 
unstable  source must be responsible,  such as an intense fire.  Another 
puzzlement has been the sighting of one arm of the ring when the other 
arm could not  be detected. 

Luminous  points  continued  to  be  reported  by  discriminating 
observers  into  the  19th  century.  Again,  satellites  of Saturn  had  to  be 
ruled out as none could be located in the vicinity. The most astounding 
and  now  famous  observations  of  a  light  source  came  in  the  20th 
century  on  9  February  1917.  Two  astronomers,  Maurice Ainslie  and 
John  Knight  of  Great  Britain,  observed  the  source  independently. 
Brightness  of the  source  was  so  intense  that  Ainslie  referred  to  the 
object  as  a  "star".  The  star  traveled  a  straight-line  course  which,  in 
effect,  subtended  a chord  across the  ring  system.  Length  of the chord 
was of the order of 125,000 km (77,700 mi).  Observed time to traverse 
this chordal distance across the ring system was 1 hour and 40 minutes, 
making  the  average  velocity  21  km/sec  (13  mi/sec).  This  value 
compares with  an  average  velocity  for Voyager en  route  to  Saturn  of 
about 13.7 km/sec (8.5 mi/sec). That is, the star was about 1 1/2 times 
faster.  During  the  observations  when  the  star  was  in  plain  view,  the 
light  therefrom appeared  to  be elongated.  There was  a  strange  aspect 
about  the  traversal  itself.  Seeming  to  move  through  the  ring  plane 
without  difficulty,  the  star  appeared  to  devour  material  ahead  as  it 
proceeded.  Further,  at no  time did the rings completely  block out the 
radiating  light. 

Results from Voyager 1  have added new puzzlements. For example, 
so-called "spokes" of light stretch across part of the ring system; the F 
ring,  which is  positioned  alone  outside  the main  ring plane,  contains 
entwined  strands  or  "braids";  intense  electrical discharges  similar  to, 
but  much  greater  than,  terrestrial  lightning  have  been  recorded;  and 
Saturn's moon Iapetus is about  10 times, or one order* of magnitude, 
brighter on the sun-shadowed side than on the sun-exposed side. 

Ring-plane  thickness  has  been  an  exasperating  frustration  for 
almost 200 years. Voyager  1  did not shed any new light on the matter. 
Later,  Voyager  2  added  mystery  to  the  existing  enigma  when,  on  26 
August  1981,  instrumentation indicated  the effective ring-plane thick-
ness to be in the neighborhood of 1000 km (about 600 mi). This value is 
about twice those reported at the turn of the  18th century, and over an 
order  of magnitude  greater  than  measurements  obtained  during  the 
onset of the 20th century.  The problem is how to explain  such  a wide 
spread  in  measurements  of  the  same  thing.  Pressure  mounts  to 
recognize  all  ring-thickness  values  as  being  approximately  correct  at 
the  time  obtained.  Such  recognition,  however,  requires  discarding  a 
belief that  20th century telescopes could yield  vastly better gross  ring-
pattern definition  than  18th century telescopes. 

How  is  it  possible  for  so  many  conscientious  observer-analysts  to 
encounter  so  many  blocks  to  progress?  Part  of  the  answer  to  this 
question seems to be that preconceived ideas have been converted into 
fixed ideas. Then, when new data are received which do not conform to 
the fixed ideas, an impediment to progress is experienced. The reported 

*An estimate of magnitude expressed as a  power of 10. 
variance  in  ring-plane  thickness  is  a  really  good  example.  A  pre-
conceived  idea  which  tacitly  has  become  fixed  is  that  ring  thickness 
should be a constant, whereupon, variable thicknesses are intolerable. 
An  impersonal  method  for  dispensing  with  unwanted  measurements 
has  been  to  attribute  variances  plausibly  to  poor-quality  telescopes. 
Notwithstanding  the  tendency  to  dispose  of untoward  data,  another 
part of the answer to the question is that something in or about the data 
is being overlooked.  Oversight unobtrusively is convenient when fixed 
ideas  are  being  promulgated.  However,  oversight  also  can  occur 
because  of  presumptive  expectations  that  confirmative  new  findings 
will be obtained.  Important facts have an uncanny tendency to remain 
obscure. 

Correct  explanations  of  Saturn's  mysteries  not  only  must  be 
consistent  with flyby observations,  but  also  they  must  agree  with  the 
general  thrust  of  findings  by  earlier  observers.  For  example,  17th 
century  observers  indicate  that  Saturn's  present  annular-ring  system 
has not always been so configured. On an absolute scale,  17th and  18th 
century  telescopes  admittedly  were  not  sophisticated.  However,  re-
corded  differences  in  ring-system  configurations  were  made  with 
nearly  equally  unsophisticated  telescopes.  Therefore,  while  minutiae 
concerning  ring  shapes  can  be  questioned,  gross  differences  in  form 
most likely are valid. 

A valid explanation for ring configuration as seen by Voyager  flybys 
should  be  capable  also  of encompassing  17th,  18th  and  19th  century 
observations. When a single causal mechanism explains several events, 
the  correct  explanation  almost  certainly  has  been  found.  Conversely, 
when  a plurality  of mechanisms  is  required  to  explain  several  events, 
the  correct  explanation  almost  certainly  has  not  been  found.  In  the 
former  instance,  no  coincidences  are  required.  In  the  latter  instance, 
unlikely  coincidences  are  required.  Existence  of concurrent  happen-
ings,  or a multiplicity of sequential  happenings,  only can be hypothe-
sized.  Introduction  of  coincidences  into  an  analysis  potentially  is 
fraught  with  error. 

Though  the  facts  developed  herein  resemble  science-fiction  fantasy, 
impersonal  photographs  convey  real-life  non-fiction.  Photographs 
and  illustrations,  coupled  with  their  captions  and  labels,  provide  a 
skeletal  framework  of  this  scientific  reference  work.  Pieces  of  the 
Saturn puzzle  are  presented  in  an  ordered manner.  Consequently,  the 
reader is  urged  to  proceed  as  though each chapter is  a  prerequisite  to 
the  subsequent  one. 


================================================================
CHAPTER 2. Acclimation  to  Huge  Immensity 

Incredibly large and powerful objects exist in the universe. As a class, 
the largest and brightest single objects are star-like radio sources called 
quasars.  An example is quasar 3C-273, estimated to be about a light-
year* across and to produce energy equivalent to about 10 trillion suns. 
This object is located so remotely that its signals, traveling at the speed 
of light,  require about  30 million centuries to  reach earth.  Indeed,  the 
universe is a place in which huge immensity abounds.  Memory of this 
characteristic  is  essential  when  shifting  thought  from  familiar  terres-
trial physical sizes to unfamiliar,  extraterrestrial ones. 

Being  only  about  1/1000  light-year  across  the  outermost  planetary 
orbit,  our  solar  system  is  small  compared  with  the  size  of  quasar 
3C-273. Yet spatially, the solar system is quite immense. For example, 
the  distance  between  the  sun  and  its  outermost  planet  Pluto  is  3.7 
billion miles. Sunlight requires about 5 1/2 hours to journey there; and a 
spacecraft traveling at only 34,000 miles per hour would  require  1 1/4 
decades to make the same trip.  In the solar system, 9 planets orbit the 
sun.  These bodies are enumerated in Table I  to illustrate comparative 
size  and position. 

In  Table  I,  Mercury,  Venus,  Earth  and  Mars  comprise  the  inner-
planet  group  which  orbits  nearest  the  sun.  Jupiter,  Saturn,  Uranus, 
Neptune and Pluto constitute the outer-planet group. An asteroid belt, 
not  included  in  the  table,  lies  between  the  Mars-Jupiter  orbits  and 
serves to mark separation between the two groups. Diameters of all the 
inner  planets  are  less  than  one percent that  of the  sun.  Earth  slightly 
out-ranks Venus in size with a diameter of nearly  1/100 (0.92 percent) 
that of the sun.  Except for Pluto,  all planets in the outer groups have 
diameters greater than 3.6 percent of the sun's. Of all planets, Jupiter is 
the largest with a diameter slightly exceeding 1/10(10.1 percent) that of 
the  sun.  Saturn  is  second  largest  with  a  fractional  comparative 
diameter of 1/11  (8.7 percent). An appreciation  of the  relative spacing 
of the planets with respect to the sun can be obtained by noting time for 
sunlight to be received. Inner planets receive light from the sun ranging 

*Distance  traveled  by a  particle moving at  the  speed  of light  for a year. 
TABLE I 

Comparative  Size and Position  of Planets in the  Solar System 

from  only  3  to  13  minutes  (0.05  to  0.21  hours).  In  contrast,  outer 
planets receive light ranging from about 3/4 to 5 1/2 hours. As between 
Earth and Saturn, the time differential for a light signal is almost  1 1/4 
(1.32 minus 0.14) hours. This time corresponds to the shortest orbital 
distance  between  the  two  planets  of  8.55  (9.55  minus  1.00)  astro-
nomical units, or 794.3 million miles. 

By earth standards,  the approximate 800 million miles  to Saturn is 
an immensely large distance.  Voyager  1  traversed approximately this 
distance and took over 3 years and 2 months to do so. Voyager 2 on its 
journey to Saturn traversed about 1.4 billion miles, a journey requiring 
slightly  more  than  4  years.  Historically,  these  accomplishments  are 
superb.  However,  limited  speed  and  load-carrying  capability  of 20th 
century spacecraft preclude extensive excursions in or beyond the solar 
system.  Significant  improvement  in  this  restricted  ability  to  travel 
extraterrestrially  awaits  the  application  of  nuclear  power  to  space 
flight-propulsion  systems. 

Technological  limitation  is  not  the  only  impediment  to  space 
exploration.  There is also  the problem of sustained economic support 
for  long,  expensive  space  flights.  These  severe  restrictions  suggest 
strongly that more should be expected from space flight than extensive 
data generation. Data analyses are the key. Analyses must be directed 
toward  pin-pointing,  in  a  timely  manner,  specific  worthwhile  objec-
tives for succeeding flights. A long wait, say  10 years, before data from 
a  flight  are  digested  comprehensively,  does  not  permit  plans  for 
subsequent  flights  to  benefit  very  much  from  prior  experience. 
Apropos,  six years after launch, Voyager flights returned no compell-
ing  reasons  for  undertaking  further flights to  Saturn  or  to  any  other 
part  of the  solar  system. 

The  purpose  of  this  treatise  is  to  demonstrate  that  compelling 
reasons  indeed  do  exist  for  urgent  further  exploration  of Saturn  and 
environs.  Therefore,  let  us  focus  now  on  the  Saturnian  complex  and 
concentrate  attention  there. 

Since  the  Galilean  period  nearly  400  years  ago,  Saturn's  most 
notable feature has been its rings.  These rings span 22 earth diameters 
and  extend  on  either  side  of the  planet  an  equivalent  of  1.13  Saturn 
diameters.  Sufficient  consistency  in  plan-form  of  the  ring  plane  has 
been  displayed  over  time  such  that  designations  could  be  assigned  to 
various  regions.  Starting  from  the  outer  edge  of the  ring  plane  and 
progressing inward, four rings have been designated: A, B, C and D. A 
narrow separation occurs in the outer extremity of the A ring called the 
Enke*  division,  after the discoverer Johann Enke.  The A and  B  rings 
are considered  non-contiguous,  being  separated  by a  space called the 
Cassini  division  after  the  Italian-born  French  astronomer.  The  inner 
edge of the B ring also constitutes the outer edge of the C ring.  The D 
ring fills a space from  1.1  Saturn radii to the inner edge of the C ring, a 
ring having a so-called "crepe" texture. Additional radial designations 
are not consecutive, owing to the chronological order of discovery. For 
example, before Voyager  1, a faint ring located between about 3 and 8 
Saturn  radii  had  been  assigned  the  next  alphabetical  designation,  E. 
Then  Voyager  1  found  two  rings  between  the  A  and  E  rings.  These 
latter  two  rings  have  been  designated  F  and  G,  with  the  F  ring  being 
innermost. 

Photographic imagery from Voyager  1  has credited Saturn with  15 
satellites, or moons. Voyager 2 added several more. Of the entire total, 
only 8 are spherical bodies, the remainder all being irregularly shaped. 
Enumerated  in  progressively  outward  orbital  locations  from  Saturn, 
the  spherical  satellites  are:  Mimas,  Enceladus,  Tethys,  Dione,  Rhea, 
Titan,  Iapetus  and Phoebe.  The first four,  Mimas,  Enceladus,  Tethys 
and  Dione,  lie  within  the  radial  expanse  of the  E  ring.  Rhea,  at  8.7 
Saturn  radii,  orbits  closely  outside  the  E-ring  outer  edge  (8.0  Saturn 
radii).  Titan,  Iapetus and Phoebe are quite remote, being at about 20,

(b)  Spherical Satellites 
59 and 215 Saturn radii, respectively. Practically all irregularly-shaped 
satellites  occupy  the  zone  between  the  A  and  G  rings.  Two  of these, 
1980S27  and  1980S28,  are  unique  in  that  they  orbit  tightly  astraddle 
the  F  ring.  This  particular  pair  has  been  designated  "shepherding" 
satellites. 

Saturn's  rings  and  spherical  satellites  are  summarized pictorially in 
Plate 1, parts (a) and (b). Part (a) shows the relative spacing of the rings 
with their classical nomenclature. Part (b) shows spherical satellites in 
their relative orbital spacing. Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea 
and E ring are close to Saturn compared with the outer satellites Titan, 
Iapetus and Phoebe.  Considering the Saturn-system boundary defined 
by the orbit of the outermost satellite Phoebe, the system diameter is 26 
million km (16 million mi). Also equivalent to 0.17 astronomical units, 
the system span measures about half the distance between the Sun and 
the innermost planet Mercury (0.39 AU). 

Saturn  is  an  order  of magnitude  larger  than  Earth.  Yet  Saturn  is 
regarded with wonder and  astonishment,  not because of its large size, 
but  because  of perplexity  aroused  over  its  dramatic  rings.  A  widely 
held,  popular  view  is  that  ring  divisions  are  always  located  in  the 
same place.  This  mythical view persists despite  observational  reports 
indicating  significant  variability  in  ring-division  location.  An  exem-
plary  case  in  point  is  the  Enke  division.  After  Professor  Enke's 
announcement  concerning  discovery  of  a  gap  in  the  A  ring,  some 
observers  could  not  find  the  alleged  separation  at  all.  Others  who 
succeeded reported the gap located at various distances inboard of the 
A-ring outer edge.  Distance  of the  Enke gap inboard from  the A-ring 
outer  edge  can  be  expressed  non-dimensionally  as  a  fraction  of  the 
entire A-ring  radial  width.  Fractional-distance  locations  of the  Enke 
gap  inboard  of the  A-ring  outer  edge  show  appreciable  variation  as 
follows: 0,  1/4,  1/3, 2/5 and  1/2. According to these data, constancy of 
location within the A ring definitely is not an attribute of the Enke gap. 
There  have  also  been  indications  of  other  variations  in  ring 
geometry.  Different ring-plane thickness values have been reported as 
well as different values for width of the Cassini gap.  Cassini gap-width 
variation, as much as 33 percent, reflects time-variant radii for the  fi-
ring outer edge and the A-ring inner edge.  An impression is conveyed 
that latest reported measurements purport to be the true ones when, in 
reality, all might be quite nearly correct at time of observation. General 
reluctance  to  accept variable  ring-system  geometry occurs  because  of 
apparent failure to identify a physical mechanism suitable for produc-
ing recurrent change. 

Presented in Plate 2 is  a photograph of Saturn exhibiting circularly 
complete rings. The elliptical appearance of the rings is due to the angle 
at which the ring plane is viewed. Near the ends of the major axis of the 
ring  ellipse, the Enke division can be identified by a short, dark arc. By 
scaling the photograph along the ring major axis,  the Enke division is 
found  located  a  fractional  distance  of  1/5  the  A-ring  width  from  the 

Plate 2:  Saturn, second largest planet in the solar system, exhibiting circularly complete rings. 

ring outer edge.  This value is at the low end of the historical range of 
reported  values. 

Separation of the A and B rings by the Cassini division also is evident 
in Plate 2. This division shows as a clear space across the face of Saturn, 
then as a dark and broad continuous arc throughout the remainder of 
the ring. Ratio of the A-ring breadth to the B-ring breadth scales 3 to 5. 
On the same scale,  Saturn is 21.6 units in diameter.  For an equatorial 
diameter of Saturn equal to 120,660 km, apparent width of the A and B 
rings  is  about  16,750  km  (10,400  mi)  and  27,930  km  (17,350  mi), 
respectively.  Distance of the Enke division from the A-ring outer edge 
is  calculated  to  be  3350  km  (2080  mi).  Obviously,  large  distances 
photographically are compressed into an exceedingly small space. The 
A ring illustrates well this high degree of compression.  Width of the A 
ring  is  equivalent  to  about  an  18-hour  non-stop  jet  flight  between 
Montreal,  Canada and Melbourne, Australia.  Yet in the photograph, 
this  great  distance  is  represented  by  only  6/10  cm  (1/4  inch).  Mental 
cognizance  and  retention  of  this  high-compression  characteristic 
during  examination  of  subsequent  photographs  is  helpful  to  their 
comprehension.

THE  SATURN  STRONGHOLD 


================================================================
CHAPTER 3. Saturn's  Rings  Explained 

Luminous  sources  at  Saturn  have  been  observed,  notably  by 
Herschel,  Knight  and  Ainslie.  In  one  instance,  a fiery source  moved 
suddenly  away  from  the  A-ring  outer  edge.  In  another  unrelated 
instance  a  bright,  elongated  source  pursuing  a  straight-line  course 
entered  the  A-ring  outer  edge,  traversed  the  Cassini  division,  and 
exited  the  opposite  A-ring  outer  edge.  After  these  dramatic  events, 
luminous sources did not become a specific subject of inquiry as might 
be expected - that is,  until this analysis many years later. 

Plate 3: A luminous source appears in the A-ring of Saturn. 

A number  of luminous  sources  appear in Voyager imagery.  One  of 
these sources,  located in the A ring,  is documented in the photograph 
of  Plate  3.  A  pointer  locates  this  source  which  appears  as  a  small 
reddish-orange  spot.  In the picture,  the A  and  B  rings  readily can  be 
identified;  and even some of the faint C ring can be distinguished. The 
Cassini  division,  pointed  to  in  the  upper  left  corner  of  the  picture, 
clearly  is  formed  by  a  separation  between  the  A  and  B  rings. 
Diagonally  in  the  opposite  corner  below  the  luminous  source,  a 
comparably formed Cassini division is absent. The B-ring outer edge is 
complete.  However, between points (1) and (2), the A ring is nowhere 
to be seen. A segment of the A ring appears strangely terminated across 
a  chord  of  the  entire  ring  system.  Absence  of  this  ring  segment  is 
addressed  subsequently. 

Because  of the  shallow  view  angle  of Saturn's  rings  in  Plate  3,  the 
distance between points (1) and (2) appears very highly compressed. As 
a  result,  the  immense  length  of the  ring-segment  chord  is  not  readily 
comprehensible.  To  aid  comprehension,  Plate  4  conceptualizes  the 

Plate 4:  Conceptualization  of  the  incomplete  A-ring  in  a  polar  view  of  Saturn's  northern 

hemisphere,  using Earth as a comparable  reference measure.

incomplete  A  ring  in  a  polar  view  of  Saturn's  northern  hemisphere. 
Earth profiles  are introduced to  provide  a familiar reference measure. 
Line-of-sight is perpendicular to the ring plane so that all rings appear 
in  true  relative  proportion.  The  length  of the  ring-segment  chord  is 
greater than Saturn's diameter.  This fact is illustrated by projection of 
parallel  dotted  lines  from  Saturn  to  the  chord.  These  dotted  lines 
intersect  the  ring  chord  within  the  cut-off segment  of the  A  ring.  The 
Enke division, placed at 2/5 the A-ring width from the outer edge, can 
be seen to intersect the chord at nearly the same points as the projected 
dotted lines.  The distance subtended by the entire chord is equivalent 
to  slightly  over  10  earth  diameters.  Only  about  6  earth  diameters 
comprise the radial distance from  Saturn's surface to the A-ring outer 
edge.  Other distances  also  can  be compared.  For example,  the  radial 
span  from  the  inner  edge  of the  A  ring  to  the  outer  edge  of the  Enke 
division  is  about  one  earth  diameter.  Span  of  the  Enke  division  is 
expressed by a mere line width inasmuch as this gap is only about 200 
km  (125  mi)  across.  Radial  span  of the  Cassini  division  is  about  0.3 
earth diameter. As before, Saturn's diameter is 120,660 km (74,980 mi). 
Circled numerals cross-reference the corresponding numerals shown in 
Plate 3.

(1), the information of Plate 5 is obtained. In Plate 5, efflux from along

the length  of a  slender body exhausting  at  both  ends  generates  the  A 
ring.  The luminous source seen near numeral (2) in Plate 3  appears at 
the  left  edge.  Inspection  of Plate  5  indicates  that  a  slender  body  is 
orbiting clockwise  and,  in  doing  so,  deposits  a  wide  trail.  This  trail, 
which  can  be  recognized  as  the  A  ring  without  the  Enke  division,  is 
generated  by  efflux  emanating  from  nearly  the  entire  length  of  the 
body.  While  most  of the  efflux  is  generated  along  the  top,  some  also 
appears  to  begin  underneath  and  along the  body sides in  the  form  of 
streamers. These streamers pass over the side toward the right, proceed 
above the body and contribute to the A-ring trail.  Presence of exhaust 
flames  from  each  end  of the  body  and  the  bulgy  appearance  of the 
streamers as they pass over the body suggest a circular cross-section for 
the body. A light source, somewhat greater in diameter than the body, 
is positioned below the right end.  This source is attached to  the body 
with  inter-connecting  emissions  turning  to  an  orange-red  arc  along 
the top edge. 

Emissions from the body can be viewed collectively as creating a net 
force on the unit. According to one of Isaac Newton's laws of motion, 
forces can occur only in action-reaction pairs. The reaction of the body 
to  the  action  of the  emissions  is  to  move  the  body,  presumably  in  a 
direction  so  as  to  complete  the  ring.  This  physically  inherent  mobile 
capability is justification  for calling the  body  a  vehicle*.  The ratio  of 
apparent  body  length  to  thickness,  called  apparent fineness ratio,  is 
about 13 to  1. 

Absolute  dimensions  corresponding  to  fineness  ratio  13  can  be 
estimated.  Consider that the vehicle lies  along the chord identified  by 
numeral  (1)  in  Plate  4,  and  that  the  vehicle  extends  from  the  A-ring 
inner edge to the Enke-division inner edge. By scaling the illustration in 
Plate 4,  the  body length is  found  to  be about 0.3  Saturn diameter,  or 
about 36,200 km (22,500 mi). This length corresponds to about 3 earth 
diameters. Based on a  13 to  1 fineness ratio, the body diameter can be 
deduced to be 2785 km (1730 mi). This distance is about the same as the 
airline distance from San Francisco,  California to  St.  Louis,  Missouri 
on the Mississippi  River.  Such an immense propulsive body implies a 
space engine possessing unheard-of capacity and capability. 

When the photograph of Plate 3 is enlarged in the vicinity of numeral 
(2), the information of Plate 6 is obtained. In Plate 6, a second slender 
vehicle  forms  an  A-ring  trail  which  includes  a  luminous  source.  This 
source is the same one identified in Plates 3 and 5. Breadth of the source 
is estimated to be about half the distance between the A-ring inner edge 
and the Enke-division inner edge.  This sizing places the breadth of the 

*See Appendix. 

18 

SATURN'S  RINGS  EXPLAINED 

luminous source at about 5600 km (3480 mi).  This distance is slightly 
over 1 1/2 times the diameter of earth's moon and about the same as the 
airline distance between New York and London.  The large magnitude 
attests  to  the  vast  energy  powering  the  engine  of  the  slender  space 
vehicle. 

Projecting from beneath the luminous source in Plate 6 is a wire-like 
arm  which  curves  upward  into  the  foreground  toward  the  left.  At 

Plate 6: A slender vehicle forms an A-ring trail which includes a luminous source. 

about  1/3 of its length from the bottom, the arm has a bulge in it. This 
bulge  appears to  be  a doughnut-shaped formation,  or toroid  through 
which  the  arm  passes.  Presence  of a  toroid  indicates  that  the  arm  is 
acting as  a conductor carrying electricity.  Such  an indication is  given 
because  physically  a  circular  conductor  of  electricity  has,  in  cross 
section, magnetic-field lines consisting of concentric circles (i.e., circles 
with a common center). Magnetizable matter caught in such a field will 
align itself concentrically with the conductor and collectively assume a 
toroidal  shape.  Diameter  of the  conductor is  in  the  neighborhood  of 
350 km (220 mi). Length is of the order of 4000 km (2500 mi). Without 
this  arm,  maintenance  of  the  luminous  source  probably  would  be 
impossible. 

Scaling  the  vehicle  in  Plate  6  yields  an  apparent  fineness  ratio  of 
about  13  to  1,  the  same  as  for  its  companion  vehicle  in  Plate  5. 
Orientation  of the  trails  from  both  vehicles  suggests  that  the  two  are 
moving  toward  one  another,  apparently  on  a  collision  course.  A 

collision  would  not  occur,  of  course,  were  the  vehicles  in  different 
planes or were one to surrender its position to the other.  Preference is 
for the latter. Excluding bulb luminous sources, Plates 5 and 6 tend to 
show that vehicle diameter is an approximate measure of thickness  of 
the A ring at inception. For the time frame shown then, maximum ring 
thickness  inferentially  would  be  of the  order  of 2785  km  (1730  mi). 
Obviously, at large distances from the vehicle, at the ring edges and for 
old  trails,  the  ring  would  be  expected  to  be  much  thinner  and  more 
diffuse. 

Plates 3, 5 and 6 confirm the early observations of moving luminous 
sources  by  Herschel,  Knight  and  Ainslie.  Herschel  is  credited  with  a 
source of variable luminosity, possibly of a fiery character. Knight and 
Ainslie  reported  a  luminous  source  as  bright  as  a  star.  Both  descrip-
tions fit acceptably well  that which is discerned from  the  three plates. 
An  additional  commonality  exists  between  the  Knight-Ainslie  event 
and the two vehicles in Plates 5 and 6. Specifically, the chordal path of 
the Knight-Ainslie moving source is the same chordal element defined 
by  the  location  and  orientation  of  the  two  vehicles.  Whether  these 
chords are in the same approximate position around the ring is beyond 
the  scope  of this inquiry. 

Plates 5 and 6 reveal that width of the Cassini division occurs neither 
accidentally  nor with exact  repeatability.  The  reason is  that the  basic 
spacing depends upon the radius at which a mobile vehicle orbits with 
respect  to  the  B  ring.  Even  though  this  orbital  radius  might  be 
constant,  a substantial degree of variability in character of the trailing 
flux  can alter the radial location of the inner edge of the A ring. Also, 
the  extent  of flux emission  along  the  length  of a  vehicle  can  influence 
the  width  of  the  Cassini  division.  These  possibilities  for  differences 
explain the variability in measurements by different observers over the 
years.  Fairly  narrow  tolerances,  astronomically  speaking,  on  the 
radius  of the  B-ring  outer  edge  and  the  A-ring  inner  edge  have  led 
observers to conclude that the Cassini division is a true gap.  That the 
Enke  division  is  a  true gap  has  been  doubted  because  of its  apparent 
absence from time to time. Actually, the Enke division is formed in the 
same manner as the Cassini division and in this sense, the Enke gap is 
just as true a one as the Cassini gap. 

Plate 7 shows formation of the Enke division. In the plate, the A and 
B rings as well as the Cassini division can be recognized. Once again, a 
vehicle is found depositing an orbital trail.  Efflux emanating primarily 
from  the  radially outboard  2/3  of body length is  responsible.  Clearly, 
were  the vehicle located  at  a slightly shorter radius,  the gap  would  be 
lessened.  Widths  reported  for  the  Enke  division  range  from  approxi-

20 

SATURN'S  RINGS  EXPLAINED 

mately  200  to  320  km  (125  to  200  mi).  Nominally,  this  gap  width  is 
equivalent  to  a  variation  in  orbital  radius  of  only  about  1/4  of one 
percent.  The implication is that orbital radius of vehicle position is set 
very  precisely  in  order  to  have  a  gap  produced.  Inspection  of  the 
vehicle  reveals  numerous  jets  issuing  from  many  different  positions 
around  and  along  the  body.  A  fan  of three jets  appears  to  form  the 

Plate 7:  Formation of the Enke division. 

inboard part of the trailing efflux. Each jet appears to consist of a series 
of  bulbous  swellings.  Such  swellings  are  indicative  of  the  form  of 
electricially  charged  flows  known  as  pinched  plasmas.  Length  of the 
vehicle appears to be about  10 times its diameter.  A dark jet crossing 
the body near the left end makes the vehicle appear as though there are 
two sections aligned longitudinally.  In reality,  the vehicle is integrally 
one.  An  attempt  at  sizing yields  an  apparent length  of about 4700 km 
(2900 mi) and a diameter of 470 km (290 mi). Diameters of issuing jets 
are of the order of 0.1 to 0.2 body diameter, or about 47 to 94 km (29 to 
58 mi). 

Numerous  photographs  have  been examined  with  special  attention 
being  given  to  the  outermost  region  of Saturn's  A  ring.  The  search 
produced  another  vehicle  at  the  outer  edge  of  the  Enke  gap.  This 
second vehicle, shown in Plate 8, substantiates the process by which the 
outer A ring and the Enke division are formed. In the plate, the Cassini 
division,  the entire  breadth of the A ring and the Enke division can be 

discerned.  The  outer  annulus  of  the  A  ring,  defined  by  the  Enke 
division  and  the A-ring outer edge,  again is found to consist  of a trail 
deposited  by  a  slender  vehicle.  As before,  efflux  emitted  from  around 
and  along  the  body  is  the  source  of the  trail.  Were  the  same  profuse 
efflux  to  occur  completely  along  the  vehicle  length,  little  separation

division  are  formed. 

would  prevail  between  the  new  trail  and  the  older,  inner  A-ring 
deposits.  Geometry of the trail and vehicle radial location produces an 
Enke  division  whose  centerline  is  located  inboard  from  the  A-ring 
outer edge  about  1/5  the A-ring width.  Apparent fineness ratio  of the 
vehicle is  13  to  1  as compared with  10 to  1  for the vehicle of Plate 7. 
Sizing yields  a  length  of about  5200  km  (3200  mi)  and  a  diameter  of 
400  km  (250  mi).  While  the  two  vehicles  roughly  are  comparable 
in  magnitude  and  quite  similar  in  certain  respects,  they  also  have 
differences.  A  notable  difference  is  that  the  instant  vehicle  seems  to 

22 

SATURN'S  RINGS  EXPLAINED 

have  a  longitudinal  exhaust  whereas  the  previous  one  very  definitely 
does not.  Differences in length and longitudinal body-flux distribution 
lead  to  a  difference  in  width  of  the  Enke  division.  For  the  shorter 
vehicle,  Enke-division  width  is  about  one  percent  of  the  distance 
between  the A-ring inner and  outer edges.  For the longer vehicle,  the 
Enke  gap  width  is  about  6  percent  of A-ring  width.  Nominal  values 
reported are in the range of 1 1/2 to 2 percent. A conclusion is reached 
that the A-ring outer annulus can be constructed with vehicles having 
different lengths and emission patterns. Therefore, the Enke gap can be 
located  almost  anywhere,  or  not  at  all,  within  the  A  ring  depending 
upon length and positioning of the vehicles forming the inner and outer 
annuli.  In  view  of this  possibility,  the  difficulty  of early  observers  in 
pin-pointing  a  single  radial  location  for  the  Enke  division  is  now 
readily understandable. Inability to obtain unanimous opinion for ring 
thickness is also explained. 

Formation  of  the  Cassini  division  might  be  expected  to  follow  a 
development  pattern  similar  to  the  Enke  division.  Specifically,  a 
vehicle should exist which spaces the B ring inboard of the A-ring inner 
edge so as to form the Cassini division. That this expectation is realistic 
can be shown by Plate 9. In this plate, a partially developed ring system 
is shown exhibiting a cylindrical vehicle positioned  across the  B ring. 
An  apparent  included  angle  of  about  30  degrees  is  formed  by  two 

late 9:  Partially developed ring system exhibiting a transversely positioned cylindrical vehicle i

imaginary lines having a point of intersection on the ring's outer edge. 
One  line  is  the  vehicle  longitudinal  axis  and  the  other,  a  line 
perpendicular to the outer ring edge (i.e.,  a radial line) at the point of 
intersection.  Body angularity less  than  90 degrees with respect to the 
radial  direction  indicates  that  the  vehicle  occupies  a  slewed  position 
within the ring.  A slewed  position is consistent with that observed for 
vehicles located in  the inner and  outer A-ring annuli. 

In  Plate  9,  ends  of the  B-ring vehicle  are  labeled.  At  the  left end,  a 
short  length  of  axial  exhaust  is  detectable.  An  implication  is  that 
condensed  and  solidified  exhaust  products  are  the  primary  con-
stituents of the C ring. At the right end, the axial exhaust stream can be 
identified  passing  through  the  A  ring.  Penetration  of  the  stream 
through  the  A  ring  vaporizes  in-path  material  and  renders  the  ring 
discontinuous.  Also  at  the  left  end,  three  bulbous jets  of matter  are 
ejected.  Towards the right end,  three more bulbous jets emerge from a 
small  common  area.  Quite  likely  all  the  bulbous  jets  are  pinched 
plasma  formations  inasmuch  as  the  presence  of  substantial  heat  in 
exhaust  products  is  indicated.  Emissions  at  other  body locations  are 
identified in  the plate.  All  the ejected  matter,  except for  the  right-end 
bulbous jets, provides intimate substance and texture to the B ring. The 
right-end jets rise above the vehicle, form an arch and connect with the 
A ring.  Apparent fineness ratio of the body is in the neighborhood  of 

Plate  10:  Emitting vehicle stationed outside the A-ring encompasses the F-ring location. 

24 

SATURN'S  RINGS  EXPLAINED 

13 to  1.  Rough sizing places vehicle length at about 29,500 km (18,300 
mi) and  the diameter at 2250 km (1400 mi). 

That  vehicles  do  not confine  themselves  only  to  positions  in  the A 
and B rings is illustrated by Plate  10.  Shown in the plate outside the A 
ring  is  an  emitting  slender  body  positioned  near  the  F-ring  location. 
Axial  exhaust  appears  to  emanate  from  the  body  ends,  locations  of 
which are identified.  Issuing from topside at the right end of the vehicle 
is a long streamer which extends leftward toward the A ring.  This long 
streamer and  the axial emissions are primary contributors to a massive 
cloud  which  forms  in  the  vicinity  of  the  vehicle.  Secondary  con-
tributors  are  jets  discharging  laterally  (not  labeled).  Highest  cloud 
density occurs below the A ring near the right edge of the photograph. 
This occurrence suggests a long axial exhaust emission which, owing to 
very elevated  temperature, requires a considerable distance before the 
constituents  reach  the  cloud-forming  condensation  point.  Lowest 
cloud  density  occurs  below  the  body,  attesting  to  the  comparative 
minor nature  of lateral  and downward emissions.  Intermediate cloud 
density is displayed between the trailing streamer and the A ring. In the 
vacuum of space where the environmental pressure is practically zero, 
a cross-flow can occur only because of an electrical pressure difference 
between  two  points.  An  electrical  pressure  differential  causes  elec-
tricity  or electrons  to flow from  the higher pressure to  the lower one. 
These  flowing  electrons  necessarily  must  come  from  a  highly ionized 
volume  of  matter,  an  obvious  source  of  which  is  the  vehicle.  This 
situation  again  points  to  the  reasonable  presence  of pinched  plasma 
formations.  Overall cloud breadth is estimated  to  be of the  order of 3 
earth diameters. Apparent fineness ratio of the vehicle is about 12 to 1. 
In summary, the A and B rings are formed by slender mobile vehicles 
trailing massive  efflux.  The  Cassini  division  and  the  Enke gap  within 
the A ring are created simply by definite radial spacing of the respective 
formative  bodies.  The  C-ring  and  the  F-ring  formations  apparently 
depend  upon  the presence of a  nearby  vehicle.  At  birth,  the A  and  B 
rings  appear to have electromagnetic properties.  In view of the gener-
ating  mechanism,  heretofore  confusing  variations  in  observational 
results now become explicable. 



================================================================
CHAPTER 4. Electromagnetic  Vehicles 

Mobile  capability  and  prevalence  of  slender  vehicles  introduce  a 
distinct  possibility  that  similar  units  might  exist  beyond  the  F-ring 
region.  Further,  presence of a  vehicle is likely whenever rings appear. 
Such  likelihood  is  in  consonance  with  the  explanation  for  the  A  and 
B  rings.  Specifically,  a  vehicle-ring  coupling  exists  because  exhaust 
products  and  body  efflux  supply  ring  constituent  material.  This 
coupling  characteristic  renders  the  expansive  E  ring,  positioned 
roughly between  3  and  8  Saturn  radii,  a highly suspect candidate for 
additional  activity.  Orbiting  within  this  5-radii  wide  annulus  are 
Saturn  moons,  Mimas,  Enceladus,  Tethys  and  Dione.  Rhea  orbits 
outside the E ring at 8.7 Saturn radii. Conceivably, any of these moons 
might be shadowed by one or more of the massive and powerful slender 
vehicles. 

Fortuitously,  Voyager  1  obtained  a  photograph  of  Saturn  which 

captured  images  of most  of the  aforementioned  moons.  This  photo-
graph, presented as Plate  11, shows Saturn, five Saturnian moons and 
an unexpected luminous image. Named clockwise starting at the upper 
right, the moons are: Titan, Enceladus, Mimas,  Rhea and Dione. The 
luminous image lies between Dione and Rhea. Superficially, this image 
would  appear  to  be  a  moon-like  object  comparable  in  size  to  its 
adjacent companions.  Logically, a question arises as to the validity of 
this  image.  Is  the  image  an  artifact  of processing,  or  does  it  indeed 
represent the image  of a  real  object? 

Indications  are  that  the  image  is  that  of a  real  object.  Mimas  and 
Enceladus are only about half the size of Dione and Rhea; yet these two 
moons  show  clearly.  This  observation,  in  absence  of any  specifically 
cited  photographic  malfunction,  mitigates  against  a  processing 
artifact.  Position  identification  of  Titan,  Mimas,  Enceladus,  Dione 
and  Rhea  is  consistent  with  later  known  positions  of  these  moons. 
However, the position of the luminous image between Dione and Rhea 
does  not  coincide  with  the  calculated  location  of  Tethys,  the  only 
possible moon candidate. Were Tethys in fact within the camera  field-
of-view,  this  moon  ought  to  be  visible  inasmuch  as  its  size  is 
comparable to  Dione and  Rhea.  Because Plate  11  is devoid  of visual 
depth, graphic pictorialization is helpful to gain further understanding 
of the  luminous  image. 


Plate  11:  Saturn, five Saturnian moons and an unexpected  luminous image. 

By  scaling  Saturn  and  its  rings  in  Plate  11,  a  facsimile  can  be 
constructed in which clarifying detail of the ring plane can be provided. 
Results are presented in Plate  12. This plate pictorializes the luminous 
image  in  positional  relationship  to  Saturn,  the  A,  B  and  E  rings,  six 
near moons and their orbital paths.  Boundaries of Plate  11  are shown 
by dashed lines.  Calculations place Tethys about 2/10 the straight-line 
distance between Dione and Rhea, and in an orbital path whose radius 
definitely  is  shorter  than  that  for  the  image.  Discrepancies  in  both 
radial and angular positions of Tethys with respect to the image would 
indicate that the image indeed is not Tethys. Because Tethys and Dione 
are  very  nearly  equal  in  diameter  (1050  and  1120  km  respectively),  a 
reason  should exist for obstruction of Tethys'  appearance in Plate  11. 
Certainly,  this  obstruction  can  not  be  caused  by  Tethys'  two  small 
companions  whose  largest  dimension  is  of  the  order  of  35  km  and 
which,  moreover,  follow  the same orbital  path.  Also,  little likelihood 
exists of mistaking the companions for the luminous image because of 
their  exceedingly  small  size.  Conclusive  insight  regarding  the  true 
nature  of the  image  and  surroundings  rests  finally  on  revelations  of 
micro-photographic details of the  region enclosed  by the dotted lines. 
Note  that  the  dotted-line  enclosure  excludes  Dione  and  that  it  does 
include  the  calculated  position  for  Tethys.  Also  observe  that  Rhea  is 
included at the extreme left, just outside the E ring.

rings,  six  near moons and  their orbital paths. 

Micro-photographic  details  of  the  region  shown  in  Plate  12  are 
presented in Plate  13. This enlargement of the luminous image in Plate 
11  reveals a nearby slender vehicle within the E ring. Were the picture 
three dimensional, the body would be seen tilted out of the plane of the 
paper at an angle of about 45 degrees.  The one visible end of the body 
and the exhaust therefrom are labeled in the picture. The other end lies 
obscured  behind  a  luminous jet which  projects  laterally  leftward  from 
the  body.  Emissions  issue  in  knotted  rolls  both  above  and  below  the 
lateral jet. These rolls develop an expansive labyrinth giving the E ring 
a  cloudy  appearance.  The  labyrinth  below  the  lateral jet  serves  as  a 
connection to the image.  A second connection is created by emissions 
from  the  body.  Specifically,  below  the  forebody,  this  connection  is 
established  through  two  nearly  concentric  toroids  interconnected 
radially with roll segments, like spokes of a wheel. One of these spokes 
connects  with  the  upper edge  of the  luminous  image.  This  spoke,  the 
two  toroids,  and  a central  hub  are  identified  in  the plate.  Presence of 
toroidal  formations  is  considered  indicative  that  the  emissions  have 
electromagnetic properties. The two different connections between the

body  and  image  become  paths  by  which  a  potential  difference,  or 
voltage, can be delivered remotely to a point in space. When the termini 
of the paths are sufficiently close to permit current flow, a luminous arc 
could  be  produced  as  suggested  by  the  photograph.  Were  the current 
path,  perchance,  to  be  through and around  some intermediate object, 
conceivably  that  object  might  become highly illuminated. 

In  view  of the  physical  environment  surrounding  it,  the  luminous 
image  certainly  cannot  be  a  photographic  artifact.  This  conclusion, 
however,  calls for a  reason  why Tethys is not apparent in  the picture. 
The  reason  is  that  proliferous  efflux  from  the  vehicle  blocks  Tethys 
from view. However, whether the image in the plate is, or is not, Tethys 
really need  not be resolved conclusively.  The important emerging fact 
is that all moons in the E  ring can, at some time,  be within immediate 
range  of  a  vehicle  capable  of  large-scale  electromagnetic  influences. 
Also,  consistent  with findings concerning  formation  of Saturn's  other 
rings, the E ring is caused by a vehicle spewing matter.

RINGMAKERS  OF  SATURN 
For  further  examples  which  demonstrate 

the  electromagnetic 
character of slender vehicles, attention is invited to Saturn itself.  Plates 
2  and  3  illustrate  that  Saturn's  outer  atmosphere  has  distinct  lati-
tudinal  stratification  extending  from  pole  to  pole.  These  strata  can 
be  viewed  as  thick  planar  rings,  of  varying  diameters,  centered 
vertically  atop  one  another  north  to  south.  This  multi-layer  ring 
concept  of the  outer  atmosphere  carries  the  idea  that  strata  might  be 
vehicle related.  In this context, presence of slender vehicles in Saturn's 
atmosphere  would  be  a  reasonable  expectation.  Easy  identification, 
however,  is  thwarted  because  clouds  (emissions)  tend  to  obscure  the 
sources  being  sought.  This  difficulty,  though,  can  be  circumvented. 
Plate  14  presents  a  sector  of  the  southern  hemisphere  of  Saturn 
showing cloud strata, a curious luminous point, location of a lightning 
source  and  a  slender  vehicle.  In  the  plate,  the  luminous  point  occurs 
below  a  dark  slender  object,  axially  aligned  with  an  overhead 
latitudinal  cloud  stratum.  This  isolated  body  is  labeled  a  vehicle 
because  it  has  an  apparent  fineness  ratio  of about  13  to  1,  and  also 
because  it  evidences  emissions.  At  the  horizon  left  of the  vehicle,  a 
lightning  source  and  a  lightning  location  is  indicated.  The  source,  a 
small  "tick"  protruding  into  space,  can  be  discerned  upon  close 
scrutiny.  Lightning  streaming  from  the  source  is  faint  and  hence 
difficult to distinguish.  However, the intent at this juncture merely is to 
call  attention  to  event  locations.  Imagery  is  clarified  in  the  enlar-
gements of Plates  15 and  16 used for subsequent discussions. 

Plate  14:  Sector  of  southern  hemisphere  of  Saturn  showing  cloud  strata,  a  luminous  point, 
location of a lightning source and a slender vehicle. (Non-optimum exposure for overall 
picture  favors  the  dark  region  at  planet  horizon). 

Plate  15:  Luminous point of Plate  14 essentially is an arc light whose apparent power source is a 
remote vehicle capable of generating paths carrying electricity. 

Plate  15 presents an enlargement of the luminous point in Plate  14. 

The purpose of the instant plate is to illustrate that the luminous point 
essentially  is  an  arc  light  whose  apparent  power  source  is  a  remote 
vehicle  capable  of  generating  paths  carrying  electricity.  The  vehicle 
along  with  a  couple  of  its  emissions  are  identified  in  the  upper  left 
corner  of the  picture.  From  the  lower  left  end  of the  vehicle,  a  very 
long,  slender element projects  from each  side.  This element,  labeled  a 
bi-lateral  projection,  in  turn  issues  other  projections  along  itself. 
Several  of  these  secondary  projections  lead  to  the  luminous  point. 
Connected  to  the  point  are  a  number  of  radial  filaments  which 
variously connect with the projections.  The result is that the luminous 
point  becomes  a  center  of  mis-matched  electrical  potentials;  and 
illumination is generated in much the same manner as for an arc light. 
Light  diameter  at  the  converging  intersection  of  electrical  paths  is 
estimated  to  be  in  the  neighborhood  of 45  to  50  km  (28  to  31  mi). 
Distance  from  the  originating source  of potential  appears to  be of the 
order of 500 km (310 mi).  A characteristic of arc light is high thermal 
temperature.  Temperature of arc lights employing earth technology is 
limited chiefly by the melting temperature of the electrodes (analogous 
to  filaments)  which  supply  potential  differential.  For  carbon  elec-
trodes,  this  limit  temperature  is  about  3700  degrees  Celsius  (6700 
degrees Fahrenheit). Even this modest temperature is adequate to melt 
most  solids  indigenous  to  earth.  The  luminous-point  filament  elec-
trodes, in all probability, develop much higher temperatures.  Because 
the  isolated  luminous  point  of light  implies  a  current  flow,  which  in 
turn implies a magnetic field, the conclusion is reached that the source 
vehicle  and  surroundings  are electromagnetic in  character. 

Plate 16: Two  lightning  bolts  appear  in  and  above  Saturn's  cloud  tops.  Photograph  is  an 
enlargement of Plate 14 in the area labeled "lightning location". 

Plate  16  presents  two  lightning  bolts  in  and  above  Saturn's  cloud 
tops. This photograph is an enlargement of Plate 14 in the area labeled 
"lightning  location"  and  "lightning  source".  To  improve  visual 
orientation,  the picture has been inverted so that dark space occurs in 
the upper half of the frame  and  a  small  section  of Saturn in  the lower 
half. In the discussion of Plate 14, the terminology "tick" protuberance 
has  been  used  in  referring  to  the  lightning  source.  This  plate  reveals 
that  adjoining  points  (1)  and  (2)  really  constitute  the  "tick"  pro-
tuberance.  The  lightning  location  is  clarified  in  that  a  lightning  bolt 
emanates  from  point  (1),  and  another  is  connected  contiguously  to 
point  (2).  Length  of the  upper lightning bolt  is  estimated  to  be  of the 
order of 400 km (250 mi). Length of the lower bolt is of the order of 350 
km (220 mi), for a total length of 750 km (470 mi).  Bolt diameter is in 
the neighborhood  of 10  to  12  km  (6  to  7 mi).  Power to  energize  this 
impressively  long  path  to  luminous  visibility  can  be  traced  to  a 
cylindrical  vehicle  positioned  directly  below  the  lower  lightning  bolt. 
Helpful clues regarding vehicular presence are two "wishbone" shaped 
filaments, the spread ends of which straddle the cylindrical body. Point 
(2)  locates  the  tip  of the  larger  wishbone  filament  and  point  (3),  the 
smaller.  Lateral  spread  in  each  of these  filament  pairs  helps  establish 
the  body  breadth  and  also  the  orientation  of  the  longitudinal  axis, 
shown added in the plate.  One end of the body appears to lie to the left 
of the lower lightning bolt about 3  bolt-widths away.  Highlighting the 
left end is a luminous  "exhaust  stack"  having a  rounded leading-edge 
profile  which  presents  an  elliptical  face.  An  elliptical  end  face  is 
consistent  with  an  angular  view  of  the  longitudinal  axis  for  a  body 
having  a  circular  cross  section.  The  right  end  of  the  vehicle  is 
considered  to  lie  centrally  beneath  a  U-shaped  cloud  bisected  by  a 
small roll cloud. Inferentially, the bottom tip of the lower lightning bolt 
would appear to originate from a port in the side of the vehicle.  Upon 
port exit, ejecta rise up across the body surface, then turn rightward to 
bridge points (3) and (2).  Flow continues into pivotal point (1). At (1), 
the  lightning-bolt  direction  changes  abruptly  to  the  left,  traverses  a 
sinuous  path  and  then  fades  to  completion  at  point  (4).  Point  (4)  lies 
at  a  distant  secondary  projection  on  the  left  arm  of  the  bi-lateral 
projection. A simple explanation for the progression and sustenance of 
the  lightning  bolt  is  that  successively  smaller  electrical  potentials 
prevail  sequentially along the course.  Progressively reduced potentials 
would cause ejecta originating from the port to arc to points (3), (2), (1) 
and  (4),  respectively.  These  lightning bolts have  some resemblance to 
terrestrial lightning, but they are far more immense in both length and 
breadth.  This  immenseness  implies  an  intense  magnetic  field  having 
substantial  far-reaching  effect  in  terms  of reacting  with  other existing 
fields.  Many strange shapes might occur because of such interaction. A 
propulsive  body  capable  of  creating  such  an  environment,  indeed, 
apprropriately is called an electromagnetic vehicle. 



================================================================
CHAPTER 5. A  Massive  Display  of Power 

Saturn  investigations  for  years  have  portrayed  the  ring  system  as 
comprised of primordial matter.  The utter idea that the rings might be 
quite  young  is  uncomfortable  to  primordial  advocates  because  a  key 
assumption  is  placed  in  jeopardy.  Previous  chapters  have  pictured 
several different electromagnetic vehicles actually depositing the A and 
B rings (Plates 5,  6 and 7).  These fortuitous pictures say not only that 
the  ring  material  is  quite  new,  but  also  that  continuous  regeneration 
can  occur.  Conversely,  ring  extinction  by  vaporization  is  a  realistic 
possibility.  Vaporization  could  result  consequentially  from  the  im-
mense,  high-temperature  luminous,  mobile  forms  which  can  be 
generated.  Exemplary  forms  are  a  fire  ball  larger  than  earth's  moon 
(Plate 6) and a lightning stroke almost as long as the State of California 
(Plate  16).  Yet still,  these displays of power are fairly modest. 

Plate  17:  A  colorful,  large-scale  narrow-band  disruption  in  Saturn's  rings  extending  across  the 
entire  ring system. 

One of the most massive displays of power is a large-scale disruption 
in  Saturn's  rings  extending  across  the  entire  ring  system.  This 
dramatically colorful display, presented in  Plate  17, gives the rings an 
appearance  of  being  shifted  rightward  within  a  narrow  band.  A 
discontinuity band, such as this, is rare in photographs of the A and B 
rings.  Hence  the  phenomenon  likely  is  aperiodic  and  of  fairly  brief 
duration  -  perhaps  days,  or  even  hours.  In  addition  to  the  multi-
colored  band,  very  narrow  parallel  markings  can  be  seen  extending 
chordwise across the rings in several locations. Further, two luminous 
sources appear in the right-hand sector of the rings.  One is positioned 
in the  Cassini  division  above  the  discontinuity  band,  and  the  other is 
located just  below  the  band  in  the  A  ring.  Noteworthy,  too,  is  the 
completely  filled  Cassini  gap.  Usually,  this  gap  appears  mostly  as 
empty space. An astounding 218,000 km (136,000 mi) is spanned by the 
colorful  band,  roughly  the  equivalent  of  17  earth  diameters.  Band 
width is in the neighborhood of 3000 km (1850 mi), equivalent to about 
3/4 the distance across the continental United States. Contained within 
the  narrow  rectangular  area  across  the  rings  is  an  area  of about  670 
million  square  kilometers  (approximately  260  million  square  miles). 
Thus,  the  affected  region  exceeds  the  total  surface  of the  earth,  which 
is  about  510  million  square  kilometers  (197  million  square  miles). 
Obviously,  a disturbance of such great magnitude  requires immensely 
enormous energy. Insight concerning the physical situation in and near 
the  discontinuity  band  is  provided  by  subsequent  plates  presenting 
enlargements embracing localities at points labeled  1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. 

Presence  of electromagnetic  vehicles  on  the  right  side  of  the  ring 
system in Plate  17 is clued by two luminous sources. Plate  18 identifies 
these sources and pinpoints vehicles contributing to the apparent ring 
shift  and  to  a  filled  Cassini  gap.  Involved  are  at  least  5  vehicles, 
locations of which are numbered (1) through (5). These are discussed in 
numerical  order. 

Of the five vehicles just mentioned, the first is positioned in the outer 
edge of the A ring. A substantial length of the visible body is subtended 
between  the  dual  pointers  of label  (1).  Toward  the  end,  a  wishbone 
filament  can be identified straddling the body similar to those in Plate 
16.  Emissions  from  vehicle  (1)  feed  the  nearby  luminous  source. 
Another  vehicle,  labeled  (2),  pokes  its  nose  slightly  up  out  of  the 
Cassini gap.  Body ejecta and the luminous source hide all the body aft 
of  the  nose  and  also  fill  the  Cassini  gap.  Each  side  of the  vehicle  (2) 
ejects  a  lateral  emission,  heretofore  termed  a  bi-lateral  projection  in 
discussion  of  Plates  15  and  16.  This  projection  extends  completely 
across the A and  B rings, a distance of the order of 42,000 km (26,000 
mi). Below the bi-lateral projection, a blue- colored niche exists on the 
inner edge of the B ring. This angular niche is delineated by two skewed 
linear elements. One element is a vehicle, labeled (3), positioned at the 
upper  left  corner  of  the  niche.  The  other  element  is  a  secondary 
projection, A-B, originating at a distant vehicle labeled (4). Vehicle (4). 
located  in  the  A  ring  near  the  top  edge  of  the  picture,  generates  a 
leftward  lateral  projection  from  which  the  secondary emerges  near  B. 
The vehicle and the terminal end of the projection colorfully interact to 
create  the  angular  niche.  The  interaction  creates  the  impression  that 
the  B-ring inner edge locally is  shifted  toward  the right. 

Plate  18:  Luminous  sources  provide  clue  to  presence  of electromagnetic  vehicles  as  a  causative 
mechanism  for a filled  Cassini  gap and an  apparent  ring shift. 

Plate  19:  Vehicle and ejecta in the Cassini gap in relation to an A-ring discontinuity, apparent ring 
shift  and  a  luminous  source. 

Label (5) in Plate  18 directs attention to a cylindrical vehicle whose 
nose  is  located  in  the  Cassini  gap.  From  above  and  below  the  nose, 
ejecta form an occluded division between the A and  B rings.  Plate  19, 
an  enlarged  view,  reveals  vehicle  and  ejecta  detail  and  shows  com-
ponents  of  the  A-ring  discontinuity,  the  apparent  ring  shift  and  a 
luminous source. All these interconnected events are occasioned by the 
presence of an electromagnetic vehicle.  A two-pointer label locates the 
vehicle  with  respect  to  the  B  ring  and  the  Cassini  gap.  Within  the 
spread  of  these  pointers  measured  along  the  top  element,  about  2 
body  diameters  of length  appear  in  dark  color.  About  another  body 
diameter  of length can  be  discerned  covered  with  a  mantle  of cloudy 
efflux.  Vehicular  angular  position  is  such  that  efflux  from  the  top  and 
bottom  of  the  nose  fills  what  normally  would  be  the  open  Cassini 
division,  or  gap.  Axial  exhaust,  whose  diameter  measures  about  1/2 
that  of the  body,  is  projected  into  the  A  ring  and  creates  a  blue  area 
there. A rope-like appendage, or tongue, is attached beneath the nose. 
Above  the  nose,  a  stream  of ejecta  trails  aftward  and  separates  the  A 
and  B  rings.  This  streamer  consists  of  5  interconnected  nodules*, 
labeled  (1)  through  (5).  Each  nodule  grows  a  lateral  trunk,  the  five 
Nodular  streams  are  characteristic  of  pinched-plasma  flows  and  have  electromagnetic 
Properties. 

being  designated  by  letters  (a)  through  (e)  to  match  nodules  (1) 
through  (5),  respectively.  Upper  trunk  (e)  causes  the discontinuity in 
texture  of  the  A  ring.  Trunks  (c),  (d)  and  (e)  develop  3  colorful 
branches which extend beyond the A ring and provide the appearance 
of a  local  ring  shift.  Trunk  (a)  is  connected  directly  to  the  luminous 
source.  Branches  of trunks  (c),  (d)  and  (e)  also  are  connected  to  the 
luminous  source.  Branch  connections  are  made  by  an  intermediate 
straight-line  element  labeled  a  transmission  line.  Between  the  end  of 
the transmission line and trunk (a), a luminous arc is drawn. This arc, 
or  luminous  source,  is  about  the  size  of  earth's  moon.  Structural 
manipulation  of the A ring and development of such a large luminous 
source convey the sense of tremendous power inherent in the vehicle. 
On the left side of the ring system in Plate  17, there are no luminous 
sources  to  signal  the  presence  of electromagnetic  vehicles.  However, 
findings  from  Plate  19  reveal  that a completely filled Cassini  gap is a 
positive indicator.  An enlarged view has been made of Plate  17 in the 
vicinity of location-label (3).  This view, introduced as Plate 20, shows 
the  apparent  ring  shift  and  band  discontinuities  in  relation  to  two 
electromagnetic  vehicles  in  the  Cassini  gap.  Picture  orientation  has 
been rotated clockwise 90 degrees to facilitate feature recognition. One 
vehicle is labeled (1), and the other (2). Each nose position is indicated 
by  a  pointer.  Both  vehicles  have  substantial  angle-of-attack  with 
respect to the ring plane, perhaps as much as 30 degrees. Consequently, 
the aft end  of each  is  below the ring-plane  surface  and,  therefore,  not 
identifiable directly. Unique emissions, or ejecta, along the body length 
confirm vehicular presence in the Cassini  division. 


Plate 20:  Apparent ring shift and band discontinuity in relation to two electromagnetic vehicles i 
the Cassini gap. 
At the nose of vehicle (1) in Plate 20, a unilateral projection extends 
leftward to demarcate the base of the niche in the A ring. About a body 
diameter  left  of  the  nose,  a  perpendicular  columnar  jet  rises  and 
extends to the edge of the A ring where it disappears. This jet is labeled 
a  secondary  projection  as  it  originates  from  a  primary  uni-lateral 
projection.  The  two  projections  provide  the  horizontal  and  vertical 
boundaries  of the  niche  which,  impressionistically,  appears  as  a local 
shift of the ring. Cassini-gap filler substances are produced for the most 
part by various emissions along top elements of the vehicle body. Nose 
ejecta  also  contribute.  One  of  the  sources  of  filler  substances  is  a 
hemispherical  unit,  or  "turret"  located  about  2  body diameters  aft  of 
the  nose.  Other  sources  are  nodular  streamers  which  are  discharged 
directly from the body surface. Two such streamers, a large and a small 
one, are identified in the plate. The base of the larger one is positioned 
about 4 body diameters aft of the nose.  The smaller one starts slightly 
aft of the larger one. Contributing nose ejecta take the form of a knotty 
curvilinear jet,  or  tongue,  which  protrudes  from  the  bottom  of  the 
nose. A secondary projection is emitted vertically downward from this 
tongue and causes the right-hand discontinuity across the B ring. 

Vehicle (2) in Plate 20 is similar physically to (1) in that a tongue, a 

turret  and  nodular  streamers  appear in comparable  locations.  A  uni-
lateral projection also occurs, except that it is further aft, originating at 
the  base  of  nodular  streamers.  Slightly  outboard  of  the  body,  a 
downward  secondary  projection  develops  from  the  uni-lateral  pro-
jection  to  which  other  body  side-emissions  contribute.  The  two 
downward  secondaries  supply  the  discontinuity  boundaries  of  the 
apparent  band  shift.  Cross  flow  directly  connects  the  secondaries 
above the uni-lateral projection. Below, the uni-lateral projection itself 
interacts  with  the  two  secondaries  to  create  somewhat  of a  diagonal 
flow.  An  additional  element  associated  with  vehicle  (2)  is  a junction 
located  at  the  B-ring  inner  edge,  functioning  as  a  terminator  for 
the  uni-lateral  projection.  Having  planar  sides,  this  junction  is 
tremendously  interesting.  Planar  shapes  can  be  constructed  with 
electro-potential fields, but  only  with  appropriate field combinations. 
Hence,  such  combinations  are  not  likely  to  occur  by  chance.  Infer-
entially,  applied intelligence would  seem to be required. 

Plate 21:  Braided strands, a braiding unit and cross flow between discontinuity boundaries at the 
B-ring  inner edge. 

Examination  of  the  discontinuity  boundaries  shown  in  Plate  20, 
specifically at the  B-ring inner edge,  leads to further discoveries.  These 
discoveries,  presented in Plate 21,  become evident upon enlarging the 
region  labeled  (4)  in  Plate  17.  Plate  21  reveals  braided  strands,  a 
braiding  unit  and  cross  flow  between  discontinuity-band  boundaries. 
Creating  these  discontinuity  boundaries  is  the  familiar  pair  of 
secondary  projections  originating  at  an electromagnetic  vehicle  in  the 
Cassini  division  (Plate  20).  The  projections,  labeled  (1)  and  (2),  have 
about  equal  diameters  and  are  spaced  on  centers  about  6  diameters 
apart. Attached to the side projection of (1) is a pair of tightly braided 
strands  (a)  and  (b).  These  strands  are  not  connected  to  the  side  of 
projection  (2)  in  the  same  manner  as  for  projection  (1).  Instead,  a 
connection  is  made  to  a  stubby  protuberance  thereon.  Distributed 
around  the  protuberance,  or  braiding  unit,  are  individually  attached 
strands  comprising  braided  strands  (a)  and  (b).  While  these  separate 
strands appear quite narrow in the picture, actual width is about 90 km 
(56  mi).  Considering  that  the  originating  source  may  be  as  much  as 
45,000  km (28,000 mi)  distant,  such flow is quite remarkable.  Issuing 
from the end of projection (1) are two filaments (a) and (b). One, (a), is 
positioned near the upper part of the terminal face;  and the other, (b), 
is  located  centrally.  End-flow  filament  (b)  forms  an  arch  between 
projections  (1)  and  (2).  Cross  flow  between  the  projections  occurs 
because  of  a  relative  potential  difference.  Arching  is  due  to  the 
potential  causing reorientation  of the initial flow direction. 

Plate 22:  B-ring emissions become C-ring constituents. 


Remaining  to  be  examined  is  the  central  part  of  the  ring  system 
designated as region (5) in Plate  17. This region, exhibited in Plate 22, 
shows that  B-ring emissions become  C-ring constituents.  In the plate, 
secondary  projections  (1)  and  (2),  and  end-flow  filaments  (a)  and  (b) 
are  the  same  as  previously  identified  in  Plate  21.  Similarly,  the  bi-
lateral projection is the same as identified in Plate 18. Confirming Plate 
21,  end-flow  filament  (b)  connects  with  secondary  projection  (2). 
Filament  (a)  can  be  seen  for  the  first  time  to  extend  about  midway 
across  to  the  opposite  B-ring  edge.  Near  the  mid  point,  M,  the  flow 
arches  back  to  a  point,  P,  at  the  B-ring  inner  edge,  analogous  to  the 
return  of  filament  (b)  to  projection  (2).  The  re-entrant  flow  element 
from point M is labeled filament (c). Emissions from filaments (a), (b), 
(c),  the  bi-lateral  projection  and  other  points  along  the  B-ring  inner 
edge fill the  entire  central  ring  system.  Lying  adjacently within  the  B 
ring  the  emissions  comprise  the  region  commonly  designated  the  C 
ring. However,  no  inner edge  exists  to  delineate  a  boundary  between 
the  C  and  D  rings.  For  this  particular  sighting,  therefore,  the  D  ring 
must be considered non-existent.  C and D rings have been observed in 
the past,  and  undoubtedly will continue to  be  observed  in  the  future. 
this  plate  indicates  that  their  occurrence  is  dependent  upon  electro-
magnetic vehicles in the ring system.  Specifically,  the rings are related 
to vehicle positioning and degree of emission activity. 

Plates  17  through  22  demonstrate  pointedly  the  massive  power  of 
electromagnetic  vehicles.  That  this  power  can  produce  significant 
effects  at  extremely  remote  distances  also  is  demonstrated.  Addition-
ally,  two  luminous  sources,  each  about  the  size  of  earth's  moon 
dramatize  an  apparently  simple  vehicular  capability,  albeit  an  awe-
some  power  in  the  accustomed  framework  of human  beings.  Align-
ment  and  positioning  of vehicles  on  the  left  side  of the  ring  system  is 
found  to  be  distinctly  different  from  that  on  the  right  side.  Yet,  the 
narrow discontinuity band across the entire ring system is aligned quite 
in a straight line.  Restated, several independent events acting in concert 
are  required  to  create  the  linear,  uniform-width  discontinuity  band 
across  the  tremendous  span  of chordwise  opposite  rings.  Ordinarily, 
only  a  single  causative  agent  is  dominantly  responsible  for  an  event. 
Here, however,  at least 7 powerful agents of like kind are involved.  In 
this  situation,  intelligent  coordination  would  appear  to  be  a  more 
reasonable  presumption  than  a  chance  occurrence  of  numerous 
simultaneous events.  Even were the band caused by a single exception-
ally large unit, the discontinuity band can be regarded as something of 
a  big  show.  After  all,  the  band  is  not  at  all  a  prevalent  feature  of the 
Saturnian  ring  system.  Indeed,  attention  paid  here  may  be  the  first 
directed specifically to this phenomenon. Viewed then as a rare show of 
power,  the  uniquely  colorful  band  probably  holds  the  distinction  of 
having  been  constructed  deliberately.  This  likelihood  is  enhanced  by 
the finding that the A and B rings, in fact, are constructed.  Formation 
of the  cross-system  band  and  generation  of the  A  and  B  rings  both 
imply  that  indigenous  to  electromagnetic  vehicles  is  a  portentous 
controlling  power.

CHAPTER 6. Luminoids 

With  the  single  exception  of  the  F  ring,  each  of  Saturn's  rings 
exhibits great breadth. In comparison with the other rings, the F ring is 
but a narrow trace. Uniquely circumscribing the A ring, this disparate 
ring commands curious attention in terms of its properties and origin. 
Some understanding of the F ring is afforded by the next four plates, 
23  through  26.  Introductory  Plate  23  shows  a  non-uniformly  lumin-
escent  F  ring  in  positional  relation  to  A-ring  components  and 
shepherding satellite. Specifically, the A-ring components are the inner 
and  outer  Enke  rings  and  the  separating  Enke  gap.  Separating  the  F 
ring and the A-ring outer edge is a distance of about 3700 km (2300 mi), 
labeled  (d).  Distance  (d)  is  nearly  the  same  as  the  width,  (w),  of the 
outer-Enke A  ring  (3200  km  or 2000 mi).  In  terms  of earth traverses, 
(d)  and (w)  are  roughly the  same distance as an  airline flight between 
Washington,  D.C. and Los Angeles, California.  Breadth of the F ring, 
(e),  is  about  70  to  100  km  (40  to  60  mi),  or about  1/3  the  Enke-gap 
width.  At the left, a shepherding satellite marks a segment, A, of the F 
ring having pronounced luminosity.  Around the ring to the right of A, 
luminosity  fades  gradually  until  the  ring  is  punctuated  with  a  short, 
bright,  widened  segment  left  of (1).  Right  of (1),  a  break  in  the  ring 
occurs  at  B.  Following  this  break,  a  pattern  of  variable  luminosity 
continues along the ring to the right.  Maximum brightness is achieved 
at  the  segment  labeled  C,  even  though  a  shepherding  satellite  is  not 
present  and  the  ring  is  discontinuous.  Therefore,  some  sort  of 
excitation  mechanism  exists,  other  than  shepherding  satellites,  to 
produce variable luminosity along the  F ring.

shepherding  satellite. 

(b)  Region (2), plate 23 
Plate 24: Segments  of F-ring close-up  showing  that  luminosity derives  from  emissively  active 
core material. 

To  learn  about  the  origin  of  the  F-ring  luminosity,  the  regions 
labeled  (1)  and  (2)  in  Plate  23  have  been  examined.  Plate  24  depicts 
segments  of the  F  ring close-up  showing  that  luminosity derives from 
emissively active core material. Part (a) presents a segment at region (1) 
and  part  (b)  shows  a  segment  at  region  (2).  At  region  (1),  the  finite 
segment  has  a  clumpy,  but  untwisted  core.  In  contrast,  the  contin-
uously  tapered  segment  at  region  (2)  has  a  helical  core  as  though 
composed  of  two  or  more  entwined  strands.  Both  regions  exhibit 
stubby,  luminous emission jets.  Some of the emissions act collectively 
to produce areas  of intense brightness,  or incandescence.  Plates 24(a) 
and  (b)  disclose  that  the  F  ring  consists  of  a  high-energy  train  of 
material,  neither  everywhere  continuous  nor  everywhere  of  uniform 
cross  section.  This  type  of  irregularly-shaped  emissive  material,  for 
convenience,  shall be  referred to subsequently  as luminoids. 

An external energy  supply would  seem to  be required to  sustain the 
high level of luminous output of the luminoids. That at least part of this 
energy might be supplied by the A ring is disclosed in Plate 25. Plate 25 
presents  the  non-uniformly luminescent  F  ring of Plate  23  exposed  to 
reveal interconnections between the  F ring and the A-ring outer edge. 
While  numerous  inter-ring  connections  are  present,  two  of the  more 
distinct  ones  are  pointed  out  in  a  region  along  the  A-ring  outer  edge 
where  filaments  cross.  Edge  filaments  are  a  product  of  various 
electromagnetic  vehicle  outputs  which,  as  already  has  been  found, 
extend  throughout  the  ring system.  Functional compatibility of the A 
and  F  rings  leads  to  a  realization  that  the  F  ring  is  not  an  isolated 
entity.  Rather,  the  F  ring  is  an  integral  formation  in  the  overall  ring 
system. 

Plate 25:  Non-uniformly  luminescent  F-ring  of  Plate  23  exposed  to  reveal  inter-connections 
between  the  F-ring and  A-ring  outer edge. 

An  F-ring  photograph,  printed  popularly  in  publications  to  illus-
trate  the  phenomenon  of braiding,  supports  the concept  that  the  ring 
indeed  is  vehicle  related.  Braiding  being  the  extraordinary  phen-
omenon  focused  upon,  concern  has  not  been  directed  heretofore 
toward  possible  existence  of other,  importantly  coupled  information. 
A  photograph  of  this  braided  F  ring,  exposed  to  bring  out  latent 
background  information,  is  introduced  in  Plate  26.  Plate  26  shows  a 
braided  F  ring  coupled  together  with  a  large  object.  That  part  of the 
object  which  lies  within  the  picture  extends  completely  across  the 
frame, up to a height (x) from the bottom edge. A relatively light color, 
in contrast to the upper background, delineates the area just described. 
That the light area is in fact an object is assured by the presence of two 
concentric circles whose center, (o), lies on strand (l). These circles are 
indicative  of  a  circulatory  magnetic  field  around  center  (o).  Addi-
tionally,  surface  patterns  and  shading  suggest  that  the  top  horizontal 
element  lies  farther  away  than  the  element  along  the  bottom  edge. 
Further, strand (2), is straighter above the surface-departure point, (a), 
than below it.  The greater curvature of strand (2) between the point of 
origin  and  departure  point  (b)  suggests  a  rounded  surface.  If  this 
rounded  surface  is  taken  to  be  a  circular  profile,  its  radius  would  be 
about equal to the distance labeled (x). Half-diameter (x) is about seven 
times  greater  than  the  width,  (w)  of  the  F  ring.  When  (w)  is  taken 
conservatively  to  be  about  100  km  (60  mi),  diameter  of  the  object 
would be  1400 km (870 mi), very nearly half the diameter estimated for 
the vehicle of Plate  5. 

Plate 26:  Photograph of braided  F-ring exposed to reveal a large coupled  object. 

Strand  (3)  in  Plate  26,  when  traced  toward  the  object,  is  found  to 
disappear  behind  (1)  such  that  its  surface  departure-point  occurs  at 
point (b).  Foreground strand (1) departs at (c), essentially at center (o) 
of the  concentric  circles.  Spatial  separation  of the  strand  departure 
points  sets  up  the  initial  condition  which  leads  to  braiding.  Once 
departed,  the strands  tend to entwine owing to  the inherent magnetic 
fields  attendant with constituent luminoidal emissions. At least for the 
one  case  of Plate  26,  luminoid  strands  originate  from  a  very  large, 
quiescent object.  Knowledge of the specific luminoid source cannot be 
determined with a high degree of resolution because of paucity of data. 
There  are,  however,  several  highly  suspect  vehicle  components  quite 
capable  of  producing  the  F-ring  trail  of  luminoids.  An  obvious 
component is the nose section of a vehicle when protruding sufficiently 
beyond  the  A  ring.  While  the  nose  section  of a  vehicle  is  somewhat 
more active compared with its rear section, activity near the nose could 
be quite  sufficient  to  generate  luminoids  (Plates  7  and  8).  Luminoids 
also  might  be  generated  from  vehicular  axial  exhaust  products, 
separately  or  in  conjunction  with  tip  matter  from  trailing  body 
streamers.  Moreover, this latter mechanism is compatible with activity 
between the F ring and the A-ring outer edge (Plate 25). 

From the foregoing discussion, a tentative conclusion is drawn that 
components  of orbiting  electromagnetic  vehicles  generate  the  F-ring 
trail of luminoids. Because these vehicles can travel about and position 
themselves,  a  further  conclusion  is  drawn.  Luminoids  might  be  ex-
pected  to  be  found  elsewhere  in  the  Saturnian  satellite  system,  albeit 
not necessarily active  or in  ring form. 

================================================================
CHAPTER 7. Vehicle Recognition 

Evidence is  100 percent positive that propulsive vehicles generate the 
inner-  and  outer-Enke  A  rings  of  Saturn.  Presence  of  these  units  is 
made fortuitously clear in Plates 5 through 8. Ordinarily, emissions are 
so profuse  and chameleonic  in  character  that  recognition  is  rendered 
quite  difficult.  Recognition  also  is  hindered  by  different  modes  of 
vehicle  operation  which  produce  strangely  diverse  appearances.  In 
absolute  size,  these  mobile  bodies  are  unearthly  large.  However,  in 
terms  of  typical  Voyager  photographic  fields  of  view,  frontal  body 
images  are  close  to  being  imperceptibly  small.  Feature  recognition, 
therefore,  is  in  part  a  developed  skill  of  geometric  perception  in 
relation to surroundings. Cognitive skill is deterred when one has never 
performed 
the  exercise  of  examining  and  correlating  numerous 
photographs.  Lest  this  deterrent  have  caused  difficulty  in  relating  to 
reality of size, this chapter shall approach earlier subject matter from a 
different viewpoint. Then, consideration will be given to two close-ups 
of Saturn  which  will  provide  information  transitional  to  subsequent 
chapters. 

Three distinctly different  sizes  of vehicle appear in Plates  5  through 
9. The smallest generates the outer-Enke A ring and the next size larger 
generates  the  inner-Enke  A  ring.  During  ring  formation,  hot  axial 
exhaust  is  directed  into  the  Enke  and  Cassini  gaps  tending  to  clear 
them  of matter.  The  largest  of the  three  vehicles  is  long  enough  to 
extend  almost  across  both  the  A  and  the  B  rings  (Plate  9).  Ratio  of 
length to diameter for all is in the neighborhood of 13 to  1.  Given the 
premise that the small  and  intermediate units  together generate  the A 
ring,  a  fair  inference  is  that  a  single  larger  vehicle  similarly  might 
generate  the  B  and  C  rings.  A  single  vehicle  is  inferred  because  no 
gap exists  between  the  B  and  C  rings.  If these  observations  really  are 
true,  then  it  follows  that  ring  size  must  be  a  fairly  good  measure  of 
vehicle size. 

Plate 27:  Three  fineness-ratio  13 vehicles having multiple unit sizes of 1, 2 and 4 closely satisfy tin-
planar dimensional requirements for forming the A, B, C and D Saturnian rings. View is 
perpendicular to  the ring plane. 

That, indeed, ring and vehicle size are related intimately is illustrated 
by  Plate  27.  In  the  figure  are  shown  three  fineness-ratio  13  vehicles 
having multiple  unit  sizes of 1,  2  and 4.  These sizes closely satisfy the 
Planar dimensional requirements for forming the A, B and C rings. In 
the polar view shown in the figure, the bottom element of each vehicle 
is a line, which, when extended, perpendicularly intersects an extended 
Saturnian  equatorial  diameter.  Intersections  of these  line  pairs  mark 
points  of tangency  of the  vehicle  body-element  lines  (extended)  with 
respect  to  ring-gap  boundaries.  For  example,  the  tangent  point  for 
Vehicle I is at the Enke gap; for Vehicle II, it is at the Cassini gap; and 
for Vehicle III, it is at the surface of Saturn. 

Vehicle sizes I, II and III fairly accurately portray the vehicles to the 
scale revealed by Plates 5 through 9. Vehicles I and II are seen in Plates 
5 through 8 at about the same relative location with respect to the rings 
as shown in figure 27.  Vehicle III in Plate 9 assumes a position across 
the  A  and  B  rings  more  like  that  depicted  by  the  dashed  lines  in  the 
figure.  When  12,669 km (7874 mi) is taken as the unit length, Vehicle II 
is  twice  the  size  of I;  and  Vehicle  III  is  twice  the  size  of II.  Vehicle 
lengths in terms of Earth's equatorial diameter are 0.99,  1.99 and 3.97, 
respectively.  Even Vehicle  I,  the  smallest,  is  large in  that its length is 
almost  the  same  as  Earth's  diameter.  Vehicle  III  is  much  more 
immense.  A  circular  disc  having  the  same  cross-sectional  area  as 
Vehicle  III  would  cover  the  United  States  coast-to-coast,  and  extend 
from  the  south-western  shore  of Hudson  Bay,  Canada  to  Matzalan, 
Mexico.  Intermediate-size Vehicle II (1949 km diameter) has a frontal 
area  which  compares  favorably  with  the  size  of  Saturnian  satellite 
Iapetus(1460 km). 

Other  basic  cognitive  features  concern  the  countenance  presented 
by  a  vehicle  as  it  orbitally  moves  around  Saturn.  Plate  28  shows  a 
simplified  electromagnetic  vehicle  in  different  attitude  angles  at  two 
positions  during  formation  of  the  inner-Enke  A  ring.  These  two 
positions are labeled (1) and (2). 

In position (1), the vehicle presents side and bottom profiles in polar 
and equatorial views, respectively. In the polar view shown, the vehicle 
assumes a skew angle of 15 degrees. Vertex of this skew angle lies on the 
bottom  longitudinal  body  element  at  the  furthermost  point  forward. 
The skew angle is formed  by two lines which pass through the vertex: 
one line is the bottom element whose extension is tangent to the inner 
adjacent ring and also  perpendicular  to a Saturn radius extended to the 
point of tangency (dashed lines);  the other line is tangent at the vertex 
to  the  inner  ring  being  formed  as  well  as  perpendicular  to  a  Saturn 
radius  drawn  to  the  vertex  (solid  lines).  In  effect,  the  initial  angle  at 
which  a  leading-edge  nose  streamer  trails  back  over  the  body  of the 
orbiting vehicle is equal to the skew angle. To maintain constant width 
of the inner-Enke A ring, then, a vehicle must continue in orbit holding 
a constant  15-degree skew angle. A larger skew angle implies  a  wider 
ring. Thus, differing measurements by various observers for inner- and 
outer-Enke  A  ring  widths  can  be  accounted  for  by  variation  in  skew 
angle by these ring-forming vehicles. 

Plate 28:  A simplified electromagnetic vehicle in different attitude angles for two orbital positions 
during  formation  of the  inner-Enke  A-ring. 

In position (2), the vehicle presents top and side profiles in the polar 
and  equatorial  views,  respectively.  Again,  the  same  15-degree  skew 
angle is shown as for position (1), but orientation of the streamers with 
respect  to  the  ring  plane  has  been  changed.  Instead  of the  streamers 
being placed in the ring plane when the vehicle is in an attitude of zero 
degrees  with  respect  to  the  ring  plane,  the  streamers  are  now  placed 
there  with  a  different  body  attitude.  To  attain  this  condition,  the 
vehicle  first  must  be  rolled clockwise  90  degrees.  In  this  position,  the 
streamers  shoot  up  and  out  of the  ring  plane.  To  get  them  back  in, 
the tail end must be lowered so that the body is inclined  15 degrees to 
the ring plane.  When this is done,  streamers are made to flow into the 
ring plane. 

Vehicle  countenance  in  flight  attitudes  portrayed  by  positions  (1) 
and  (2)  poses  different  identity  situations.  For  example  in  flight 
attitude (1),  a vehicle virtually would  be unrecognizable when follow-
ing in  the dense wake of another.  However,  when a  new  ring is being 
formed,  in  a  polar-oriented  view  the  ring  will  assume  a  cut-off 
appearance  commensurate  with  the  orbital  skew  angle.  Thereby, 
identity readily is established.  For either of these two  situations, Plate 
28 illustrates that an equatorial view alone will provide little cognitive 
assistance.  In  flight  attitude  (2),  vehicle  presence  is  fairly  easy  to 
establish.  The  reason  is  that  the  nose  protrudes  slightly  beyond  the 
location  of the  furthest-forward  trailing  streamer.  Though  little  of the 
body can be seen in a top view, a partial revelation does not mean that 
the rest is not there. In the equatorial view of Plate 28, a vehicle exhibits 
a large profile when in the attitude of position (2). Therefore, one could 
think  that  detection  might  be  easy.  Unfortunately,  cloudiness  from 
lateral  body  emissions  tends  to  hide  everything.  Nonetheless,  mere 
identity  of  a  single  recurring  feature,  such  as  the  nose,  may  lead  to 
observation  of other  new  features  and  modes  of operation. 

Possible  new  features  and  modes  of  operation  are  offered  for 
consideration  in  Plates  29  and  30.  Both  plates  contain  close-ups  of 
Saturn,  and  attract  attention  mainly  because  of their  being  dramatic-
ally  colorful.  Order  in  the  color  patterns  prompts  examination  for 
potential  latent  information. 

Plate 29: A  dark  blue  latitudinal  stripe  in  Saturn's  atmosphere  emanates 
from  an  object identifiable as  a  probable  electromagnetic vehicle component. 

In  Plate  29,  a  dark-blue  latitudinal  stripe  in  Saturn's  atmosphere 
emanates  from  an  object  identifiable  as  a  probable  electromagnetic 
vehicle component.  Located  at  the  upper left  edge  of the  picture,  this 
object is found surrounded by an azure-blue glow.  Emission character, 
shape  and  positional  attitude  suggest  the  presence  of  an  electro-
magnetic vehicle, only the extreme end of which is observable. Atop the 
object,  stubby  emissions  point  outward  at  angles  slightly  different 
from  one  another.  These  different  pointing  angles  impute  an  underly-
ing curved surface.  Surface curvature further is confirmed by a circular 
orifice  which  appears  elliptical  because  of  being  viewed  sideways  as 
well  as  frontally.  Between  the  orifice  and  stubby  emissions,  a  section 
transitional  to  a  larger  body  diameter  is  consistent  with  diverse 
emission  pointing  angles.  A  small  toroid  located  at  the  base  of  the 
exhaust  orifice  attests  to  the  electromagnetic  character  of  the  im-
mediate locality. Below the toroid and orifice, a hose-like appendage or 
tongue  projects  longitudinally.  Adjacent  to  the  toroid,  two  arched 
azure-blue plumes are emitted  from  the tongue surface.  These plumes 
contribute  to  the  regional  glow.  Further  down,  plume  generation 
becomes quite profuse and enlarges the glow. At the edge of the azure-
blue  region,  plumes  can  be  seen  to  braid  and  knit  themselves  into  a 
tight  mass.  This  mass,  which  forms  a  long  continuum  of the  tongue, 
appears as  a  stripe in  Saturn's outer atmosphere.  The stripe is  placed 
longitudinally  whereas  the  body's  longitudinal  axis  is  displaced 
considerably  from  the  latitudinal.  Attitude  adjustment  to  accom-
modate  placement  of  exiting  matter  is  typical  for  electromagnetic 
vehicles  (Plates  18  and  28).  Indications  are  that  the  object  pictured 
probably is the exposed  nose of an electromagnetic vehicle. 

A  second  close-up  of  Saturn  containing  surprisingly  important 
information is  the frontispiece,  reprinted  as  Plate  30.  Plate  30  reveals 
salient  features  of  an  operational  electromagnetic  vehicle.  A  com-
ponent,  (1),  is identifiable  readily  as  the  nose orifice.  Extending from 
below  the  orifice  is  a  long,  tightly  twisted  tongue,  (2)  The  top 
longitudinal-profile  body  element,  (3),  is  perceptible  for  a  short 
distance  aft  of the  nose.  Location  of the  bottom  longitudinal-profile 
body  element  is  obscured  inasmuch  as  a  solid  band  of  under-body 
emissions,  (4),  exhausts  where  this  element  otherwise  would  appear. 
The  distance between  these  two locations  establishes  an  approximate 
body  diameter,  (5),  and  permits  estimation  of  trailing-end  location.

Plate  30:  Salient features of an  operational electromagnetic vehicle. 

When a  13 to  1 fineness ratio is used for length estimation, the trailing-
end,  (6),  lies just  beyond  the  furthest  aft  body-attached  streamer,  (7). 
Back at the nose a bi-lateral projection, (8), can be identified extending 
on each side.  Branch streamers, (9), rise from this projection and  flow 
centrally to form a large overhead annulus, (10).  Secondary streamers. 
(11), flow into this annulus from in- and out-board of the body. Aft of 
the annulus two luminous sources, (12), are sustained above the body. 
These  sources  are components  of a complicated  network  of filaments. 
Starting at the cylindrical body, filaments rise upward and form a long 
braided roll, (13). This roll, in turn, emits filaments which contribute to 
the luminous sources.  Filaments exiting from the sources complete an 
electrical path upon  termination at  outer-boundary trailing streamers, 
(14). The electromagnetic character of these phenomena is affirmed by 
presence  of nodules,  (15),  on  streamers just  aft  of the  annulus.  These 
nodules,  being visual properties  of pinched plasmas,  are indicative of 
electromagnetic  interactions. 

Determination  of absolute  size  is  precluded  because  of uncertainty 
in reference-dimension accuracy. However, a body length equal to one 
earth  diameter  can  be  assumed  per  findings  of  Plate  27.  For  this 
situation,  the annulus outside diameter is about equal to the diameter 
of Earth's moon; and the luminous-source diameters are about  1/3 this 
size.  Length of body lateral projections appear to reach at least a body 
length,  if not  farther.  The  projections  in  the  picture  extend  outboard 
such  that  their  terminal  emissions,  (16),  form  a  well-defined  latitude 
boundary on  Saturn.  Between  the body and  terminal emissions,  body 
projections  leave  wakes  of  matter,  (17),  along  their  entire  lengths. 
Literally, rivers of electrically charged matter flow from the entire body 
and  affect  vast  areas.  By  any  worldly  standard,  this  display  of 
organized  power is profoundly awesome. 

Plate  30  has  afforded  an  opportunity  to  discuss  properties  of  an 
operational  electromagnetic  vehicle,  but  only  generally.  Now,  the 
front-end  section  will  be  addressed  specifically  to  emphasize  detail. 
Accordingly,  Plate  31 
introduces  a  rendering  of  the  front-end 
appearance  of the  electromagnetic  body  pictured  in  Plate  30.  In  the 
order  discussed,  the  following  are  labeled  for  ready  identification:  (1) 
cylindrical body; (2) axial exhaust; (3) bi-lateral projection; (4) under-
body emissions; (5) nose tongue; (6) nose trailing streamer; (7) branch 
trailing  streamer;  (8)  body  trailing  streamers;  (9)  nose  peripheral 
emissions;  and (10) streamer collector.

A  cylindrical  body,  (1),  emits  a  faint  axial  exhaust  flame,  (2),  of 
probable  extremely  high  temperature.  Diameter of the  exhaust  orifice 
is  about  1/2  body  diameter.  Aft  of the  nose  about  a  body-diameter 
distant is located a bi-lateral projection,  (3).  This projection might be 
likened  to  wings  on  an  airplane.  Below  the  projection  is  positioned  a 
lengthy  bank  of  under-body  emissions  or  flame  jets,  (4).  In  frontal 
view,  these jets would extend  radially outward  from  beneath  the body 
at  a  probable  angle  of about  45  degrees.  Immersed  in,  but  extending 
out  of,  the flame bank is a tightly entwined tongue,  (5).  The length of 
the tongue is at least 2 body diameters and has capability within itself 
to project emissions or plumes. Atop the body nose just aft of the axial 
exhaust  flame,  a  bulbar  pinched  streamer,  (6), flows upward  and  aft. 

Other  streamers,  (7)  and  (8),  also  flow  aft.  Streamer  (8)  starts  at  the 
body; but streamer (7) commences from a lateral projection.  Streamer 
(6)  shows  an  ability  to  branch directly  forward.  At  the  nose  ahead  of 
the  foreground  lateral  projection,  a  small  jet  (9),  is  emitted  which 
jumps  or  "shorts"  to  the  projection.  This phenomenon illustrates  the 
presence  of different  electrical  potential  (voltage)  levels  and  demon-
strates  the  mechanism  that  governs  flow  paths.  Also  in  this  same 
vicinity,  numerous  small  radial  emissions  occur  around  the  exhaust 
cowl.  The  hub  labeled  (10)  acts  as  a  collector  to  coalesce  beginning 
streamers. Coalescence forms an embryonic streamer which ultimately 
bursts  forth. 

In  this  chapter,  cylindrical  propulsive  bodies  of  approximate 
fineness ratio  13  have been pictured with lengths ranging from  1  to 4 
earth  diameters.  The  bodies  and  lateral  projections  spew  matter  at 
elevated  temperature  and  high  electrical  potential  in  an  orderly, 
understandable  manner.  Because  of the  natural  propensity  for  emis-
sions to seek the least path of resistance to attain a lower potential, all 
objects having a lower relative potential are subject to electromagnetic 
inter-action  in  some  degree.  How  influential  it  is,  of course,  depends 
upon  the  distance  between  the  electromagnetic  components  and  the 
object. Clearly, hot parts of a vehicle could leave imprints on large solid 
objects,  as  though  branded.  Saturn's  rings  exhibit  some  of the  many 
residual  forms  which  ejected  matter  can  take.  Because  of  their 
mobility,  vehicles  can  be  expected  to  appear  almost  anywhere.  A 
signature  of  former  presence  would  be  unique,  solidified  objects  of 
appreciable  size  and  differing  shapes.  Ejecta  of different colors  equate 
to  different  substances,  or compounds.  Interestingly,  water  in  vapor, 
liquid or solid state most likely is a major and prolific exhaust product. 
This  assertion  is  based  upon  indications  that  Saturn's  great  rings  are 
composed  of  water  ice.  Vastness  of  range  in  vehicular  capability 
further  is  indicated  by  large-scale  formation  and  huge,  sustentative 
luminous  sources. 



PART III 

OUTLYING  BASTIONS 


================================================================
CHAPTER 8. Dione Gives  Up a Big Secret 

Saturn  has  revealed  itself  as  an  inconspicuous  habitat  for  ultra-
powerful  machines.  Machines  always  have  a  purpose.  All  require 
inputs.  Then  by  an  intermediate  process,  all  yield  outputs.  Outputs 
consist not only of the intended products or services but also of refuse. 
As  the  Saturnian  ring  system  so  well  illustrates,  refuse  can  be  seen 
much  more  readily  than  the  producing  sources.  Dione  also  falls  into 
this same pattern. 


Plate  32:  Luminescently active landscape on  Dione.

5.  Large lumps 
6.  Penumbra 
7.  Umbra 
8.  Colored  illumination 


On  Dione,  a  luminescently active landscape can  be identified.  Plate 
32  shows  this topographical  activity.  Specifically,  over about 250  km 
(150  mi)  of its  landscape  near  the  horizon,  Dione  displays  a  narrow, 
hazy-white  elevated-surface  band,  (1),  profusely  emitting  blue  ejecta, 
(2).  This illuminated band appears to  rise above the plain topography 
in the foreground by nominally 7 km (4 1/2 mi).  One part of the band 
consists  of shapes  approximating  cylinders,  (3),  staggered  in  position 
abreast  and  crosswise  of one  another.  Another  part  contains  angular 
shapes,  (4).  Foreground  topography  appears  to  consist  of the  same 
substance  as  the  elevated  band.  However,  emissions  are  not  so 
pronounced;  and  the  surface  presents  softer contours  as  though  large 
lumps,  (5),  had  fused  together while in  a  malleable  state.  Beyond  the 
penumbra,* (6), well into the umbra, (7), where a solid shadow should 
occur,  a  spot  of  multi-colored  illumination,  (8),  appears.  In  this 
completely  shadowed  region,  the  wall  side  of any  crater is  too  low  to 
intercept  sunlight  and  cause  reflection.  Inferentially, 
the  active 
topographical  area  stretches  afar.  A  conservative  estimate  is  73,000 
square  kilometers  (28,000  sq  mi).  In  comparison,  terrestrial  topo-
graphical coverage of naturally illuminated areas is miniscule. Further, 
the  diameter  of Dione  is  only  about  1/11  that  of earth.  Clearly,  the 
luminescent  phenomenon  on  Dione  has  no  earthly  counterpart. 
Subsequent  considerations  substantiate  this  observation. 

*A  region  partially illuminated by  the sun. 

To  investigate landscape detail,  a microphotograph has been made 
of  Dione's  narrow-band  illuminated  topography.  This  photograph, 
Plate  33,  discloses  numerous  emissions  emanating  from  many 
irregularly-shaped  surfaces.  These  emitting  surfaces  are  similar  to 
those characterizing matter in the F ring. This occurrence is puzzling in 
that  Dione  presents mostly  a  starkly barren  face packed  with craters. 
Then,  in  sharp  contrast,  active  material  resembling  an  F-ring  section 
appears  on its  periphery.  Were  this active material  of volcanic origin, 
each emission  would  assume  a  parabolic  trajectory  as  spewed  matter 
gravitated  toward  Dione's  surface.  However,  terrestrially  familiar 
trajectory profiles do not occur.  Instead, most emissions are like trees, 
(1),  in  that  they  simply  terminate  at  some  height  above  the  surface. 
Others labeled  re-entrant emissions,  (2),  connect  with nearby  objects. 
A  few  uniquely  distinguish  themselves  by  forming  classical  electro-
dynamic toroids, (3). Still others act as lifting emissions, (4), to support 
an  otherwise  floating  body,  (5).  Because of similarity with  the  F ring, 
Dione's  elevated  electromagnetic  band  raises  doubt  as  to  its  being 
indigenous.  Earlier  considerations  have  indicated  that  the  F  ring 
results  from  products  discharged  by electromagnetic  vehicles.  Hence, 
there  is  rationale  for  suspecting  that  the  active  material  on  Dione  is 
not  indigenous.  Conceivably,  appropriately  positioned  vehicles  may 
deposit  the  material.  Further  inquiry  into  this  ambiguity  is  focused 
upon peripheral space adjacent to the circumferential surface of Dione. 
First,  the  narrow-band  topography is  probed  for additional informa-
tion.  Then,  a critical  look is  taken  of a hemispherical  sector  of Dione 
which encompasses the same topography.

Presented  in  Plate  34  is  Dione's  narrow-band  illuminated  top-
ography  evidencing  widespread  emissive  ectivity.  This  plate  encom-
passes exactly the same field of view as preceding Plate 33. However, a 
longer exposure time has caused new images to emerge. Unfortunately, 
previously  well-defined  areas  have  turned  white  and  lost  detail  from 
over exposure.  Despite  this  difficulty,  the  floating  body,  (1),  (labeled 
(5)  in  Plate  33),  remains  identifiable.  Above  (1)  is  positioned  a 
truncated pyramidal superstructure,  (2) on the side of which a toroid, 
(3),  is  attached.  An  electro-filament,  (4),  extends  from  the  side  and 
reaches  upward  into  space.  Across  the  dark  space  to  the  left  a 
cylindrical  body,  (5),  having a ratio  of span  to diameter of about  8,  is 
asymmetrically  disposed  about  a  circular  object,  (6).  Another  toroid, 
(7),  is  located just  to  the  right  of the circular  object.  These  identifica-
tions  raise a question  of what lies  hidden  farther above the  surface  of 
Dione.  Faint  light  markings,  (8),  indicate  that  other  activity  indeed 
does  exist  at  a  considerable  distance  away.  Remote  activity  is  in-
congruous  with  the  concept  that  Dione's  illumination  is  indigenous. 
Suspicion is aroused that energy may be flowing into Dione inasmuch 
as the  satellite  can  be  regarded  as  being  at  low,  or  ground  electrical 
potential.  Nearby presence of an electromagnetic vehicle could  supply 
the  required  energy.  Evidence  supporting  this  notion  would  be 
expected  to  embrace  a  large  surface  area.  After  all,  vehicles  have 
size  superiority,  and  their  ultra-high-energy  projections  span  long 
distances.

Scant perspective of Dione's illuminated topography is provided by 
the  micro-photographs  of  Plates  32  through  34.  This  constraint 
compels  scrutiny  of  the  macro-photograph  which  yielded  the  three 
micro-photos. Plate 35 presents macro-views of Dione showing curvi-
linear surface markings and duality in hemispherical  lighting.  Part (a) 
provides  photographic  identifications  and  part  (b),  pictorial  inter-
pretation  aids. 

Some  of the craters  on  Dione  have  been  assigned  names.  Those  to 
which reference will be made are, in part (a): (1) Aeneas; (2) Dido; (3) 
Romulus;  (4)  Remus;  (5)  Magus;  and  (6)  Latigus.  In  the  upper 
quadrant  at  the  periphery,  numerous  rays  curve  inland  from  the 
moon's  edge.  These  rays,  numbered  (7)  through  (11),  comparatively 
are lighter in color than the surface.  Blue emissions, (12), are the same 
ones  presented  in  Plate  33.  More  blue emissions,  (13),  serve  to  unite 
these rays conceptually as a  family.

lighting.

12 and  13, Blue emissions. 

Part  (b)  illustrates  sun-ray  orientation  which  causes  the  observed 
penumbra in part (a).  In the sun-lit hemisphere,  however,  all shadows 
cast  by  terrain  elevations  are  not  aligned  directionally  with  sun  rays. 
Consistency in directional alignment should prevail when the sun is the 
only  external  source  of  light.  In  particular,  craters  (1)  through  (6) 
contain  shadow  orientations  inconsistent  with  sun-ray  direction. 
Dashed  lines  are  drawn  in  the  direction  opposite  the  shadows  to 
diagram  probable  spurious  light  paths.  Intersection  of  line  pairs 
suggests the possibility of nearby secondary light sources,  (a),  (b) and 
(c). Extrapolation of curved surface rays (7) through (11), indicated by 
solid  lines,  produces  a  companion  common  point,  (d).  These  results 
tend to indicate that some sort of elongated source of light is positioned 
abreast  of Dione. 

To reveal details of the suspect region of Plate 35(b), resort has been 
made to a composite photograph. Its purpose is to capture all available 
surrounding  spatial  detail  while  preserving  Dione's  topographical 
clarity.  This macro-scopic composite,*  Plate  36,  shows Dione  amidst 
an  impinging  electromagnetic  flow  field.  Readily  identifiable  is  a 
luminescent  filament  pair,  (1).  These  filaments  generate  a  thick 
orthogonal  filament,  (2),  which  extends  past  Dione  on  the  right.  A 
central  filament,  (3),  passes  between  filament  pair  (1)  and  Dione, 
continues around Dione and at (4), makes a Y- connection.  Filaments 
(1) and (3) issue from a source at (5). 

Highest  electrical  potentials,  of  course,  exist  at  the  source  of 
filamentary  emission.  Diminution in potential  occurs  along  filaments 
as  distance  from  source  increases.  Inasmuch  as  Dione  is  at  or  near 
ground  potential,  cross-flow  currents  can  be  expected  between 
filaments  and  surface.  Locations  having  shortest  electrical  paths  are 
where the cross-flow phenomenon most readily can occur.  Specifically, 
two  such  places  at  the  horizon  are  the  equatorial  and  south-polar 
regions.  Cross-flow  paths,  (6),  indeed  are  found  near  the  equator. 
Other  cross-flow  paths,  (7),  also  occur  in  the  south-polar  region.  In 
between,  surface markings  are interpreted  as extensions,  (8),  of cross-
flow paths. 

Above  the  surface  of  Dione  on  the  left  (north),  a  large  opaque 
toroid,  (9),  claims  filament  (3)  as  its  central  axis.  Unfortunately,  this 
toroid  partially  obscures  source  detail.  Appearances  are  that  the 
source,  (10),  has an elliptical profile within which filaments issue from 
a turbulent surface.  Small-diameter filaments from the source feed the 
toroid.  Toroidal  filaments,  (11),  in  turn  impinge  upon  the  surface  of 
Dione.  Noticeably  greater  surface  illumination  in  the  northern 
quadrant compared with the southern quadrant may be attributable to 
this ring.  Indications are that widespread surface modification is being 
experienced  by Dione. 

*For  the composite,  a detailed  image of Dione  has  been  superimposed  on  an  overall  (macro-
scopic)  view  exposed  extensively  to  enhance  background.  Extensive  exposure  whitens  and 
slightly enlarges the image of Dione.  Upon over-laying the clear image on the white one, a narrow 
whiter  border  appears  circumferentially.

Presence  of  a  nearby  electromagnetic  vehicle  satisfactorily  can 
explain  Dione's  observed  situation.  Specifically,  an  appropriately 
positioned vehicle has capability to encompass Dione with an electro-
potential  (electromagnetic)  field.  Numerous  body  lateral  projections 
and  branches  are  available  to  sustain  this encompassing field as Plate 
30 so aptly shows. Matter spewed by these components is available for 
deposit. Indeed, Dione has given up a big secret. That mobile bodies of 
high  electrical  potential  can  entrap  and  disfigure  celestial  bodies  has 
implications  of unforeseeable  magnitude. 


================================================================
CHAPTER 9. IAPETUS  MYSTERY  UNRAVELED 


Thirteen  A-ring  diameters  distant  from  the  center  of  Saturn 
pinpoints the orbital radius of  Iapetus.  Discovered by Cassini in  1671 
Iapetus  has  been  enigmatic  from  the  very  beginning  of its  recorded 
history.  During  the  two  years  following  discovery,  Cassini  found 
Iapetus  to be invisible for months at a time. His observations indicated 
that the satellite would appear only in some parts of its orbit, and not at 
all  in  others.  He  concluded  that,  during  the  moon's  passage  around 
Saturn,  various  exposed  faces  exhibited  considerably  different  reflec-
tivities.  Cassini  held  to  his  position  for  about  30  years  when,  to  his 
dismay, he found  Iapetus  visible within a "forbidden" region. About a 
century later,  Sir William Herschel  took  the view that the discoverer's 
original  position  was  the  only  one  possible.  However,  Cassini's 
skepticism  is  meritorious  in  light  of  more  recent  data.  American 
Professor  Edward  E.  Barnard,  in  1889,  reported  sudden  disappear-
ances  of  Iapetus  while  engaging  in  ring  translucency  observations. 
Further,  in  1913,  Harvard  advocated  more  study  of  Iapetus  because 
some observations had revealed sudden and large, irregular brightness 
fluctuations.  Attempts  to  explain  Iapetus  must  contend  with  these 
horns  of an  historical  dilemma. 

Plate  37  shows  Iapetus  exhibiting  dichotomous  facial  topography 
adjacent  to  an  active zone populated  with  circular and elongated light 
sources.  Topography  of  Iapetus  poses  a  scientific  puzzlement  in  that 
two  abruptly  different  surface  compositions exist  side  by  side.  Water 
ice  is  thought  to  compose  the  light  region,  (1).  The  dark  region,  (2), 
is  postulated  to  be  a  reddish-brown  carbonaceous  material  akin  to 
asphalt.  Ice  and  asphaltic  material  indeed  do  have  widely  different 
surface reflectivities.  With constant reflectivities,  Iapetus  could appear 
consistently visible in certain orbital sectors and invisible in others, as 
Cassini first surmised.  However,  Harvard's  data  indicate  that  surface 
reflectivity  definitely  does  not  remain  constant.  To  the  contrary, 
reflectivity  is  unpredictably  quite  variable.  Identification  of a  suitable 
mechanism  to  explain  any  variability  is  a  confounding  problem. 
Volcanic  action  is  rendered  quite  improbable  inasmuch  as  a  gradual 
admixture  transition,  (3),  exists  between  the  light  and  dark  regions. 

Plate 37:  Iapetus  exhibiting  dichotomous  facial  topography  adjacent  an  active  zone  populated 
with circular and  elongated  light  sources.

2.  Asphaltic  region 
3.  Transition  region 
4.  Light  sources 
5.  Isolated  light  source 
6.  Quiescent  zone 
7.  Active zone 

Characteristically,  volcanic  flows  have  sharply  cut-off edges.  On  the 
other  hand,  identification  of  an  external  mechanism  for  depositing 
dichotomous substances is equally perplexing. Topography created by 
meteor impacts  is  not  an  adequate  model  because  there  are  no  radial 
rays  emanating  from  circular  areas  which  might  be  interpreted  as 
craters.  Clearly, some new mechanism is called for. 

In addition to the dichotomous surface of Iapetus in Plate  37,  there 
are  also  intriguing  nearby  light  sources,  (4).  Circular  and  elongated, 
these  sources  are  numerous;  and  their  zonal  distribution  is  biased. 
Except  for a  single  source,  (5),  none lies within  a  quiescent  zone,  (6), 
formed  by extending boundaries  of the  obtuse dark  region,  (2).  Light 
sources  being  nearly  exclusively  confined  to  one  active  zone,  (7), 
indicate  a  possible  correlation  with  the  iceous  and  asphaltic  regions. 
This situation might  be likened  to  Dione in that electromagnetic light 
sources can selectively brighten particular topographical regions, per 
Plate 36.

an electromagnetic vehicle.

As with Dione, enhancement of peripheral space around Iapetus is 
necessary  in  order  to  disclose  what  comprises  the  environs.  Again, 
superimposed images are employed to capture available spatial detail 
while preserving topographical clarity.  Results are exhibited in Plate 
38. This composite* photograph records Iapetus illuminated by, and 
peripherally linked to, an electromagnetic vehicle. Its cylindrical body, 
(1),  is  positioned  horizontally  across  the  top  of the  picture.  Body 
diameter is  estimated  at  1000  km  (620  mi).  Illumination in  the  upper 
left corner reveals the nose end, (2). Protruding below the nose is a long 
tongue,  (3),  which  extends  past  Iapetus  along  the  left  picture  border. 
Except  for  isolated  source  (4),  all  the  large  light  sources,  (5),  are 
included  within the heretofore defined active zone, (6). The quiescent 
zone, (7), shows signs  of activity, but of a different nature. 

*For  reasons  already  noted  with  respect  to  Dione  in  Plate  36,  a  white  edging  appears 
circumferentially around  Iapetus. 

In  Plate  38  profuse  underbody  emissions,  (8),  extend  aft  of  the 
tongue  a  distance  of at least 2  body diameters.  Underbody emissions 
and  the  nose  tongue  are  positioned  essentially  at  right  angles  to  one 
another.  In  effect,  these  two  active  components  frame  Iapetus  into  a 
corner.  This  corner-framing  effect  creates  topographically  an  ap-
proximate  three-quarter  hemispherical  sector  of  exceptional  bright-
ness.  Shielded  from  tongue  and  underbody-emission  radiation,  the 
remaining  sector  is  darker  and  appropriately  shaped  to  reflect  the 
corner framing.  At  the  periphery  of the white  three-quarter region  on 
Iapetus, tongue and underbody emissions form radial links, (9). At the 
periphery  of the  dark  sector,  the  surface  pattern  extends  into  space. 
Inspection of the  sectoral  periphery reveals  roll  filaments,  (10),  which 
connect  with  an  adjacent  slender-body  filament  source,  (11).  Radial 
links  and  contrasting  sectoral  topography  are  a  manifestation  of 
vehicle activity. With an electromagnetic vehicle operating on Iapetus, 
Cassini's  and  Harvard's  exceptional  observations  are  quite  under-
standable. 

Iapetus has a diameter of about  1460 km (900 mi).  Envelopment of 
such  a  large  body  by  electromagnetic-vehicle  emissions  and  appen-
dages  has  ramifications  of  extreme  importance.  To  augment  illus-
trative  detail,  a  montage*  of  localized  micro-photographs  has  been 
assembled  covering  the  entire  photograph  of  Plate  37.  This  photo-
graphic endeavor is exhibited in Plate 39. The montage shows Iapetus 
subjected  to  an  electro-potential  field  created  by  an  electro-magnetic 
vehicle.  Six items appearing in Plate 38 are re-identified for orientation 
purposes: (1) cylindrical body; (2) nose end; (3) tongue; (4) underbody 
emissions;  (5)  roll  filaments;  and  (6)  roll-filament  source.  Additional 
items identified  subsequently serve  to identify formation  of an electro-
Potential (current-voltage) field. 

Commencing  at  the  side  of the  cylindrical  body  a  projection,  (7)  is 
evident  along  the  right  side  of the  picture.  Sprouting  from  this  body 
projection  is a  long branch,  (8),  which connects  with  the tongue  near 
the lower left corner of the montage. A sub-branch, (9), turns out to be 
the  roll-filament source,  (6),  previously identified.  Though of smaller 
breadth,  another  manifestation  of branches  from  the  body  projection 
are streamlines labeled (10). A streamline possesses the same electrical 
potential along its entire length; and various streamlines have different 
levels of potential. Current flowing from one potential level to another 
takes  the shortest  route.  The  result  is  that current  lines,  (11),  arrange 
themselves  perpendicularly  to  equal  potential  lines.  One  streamline 
terminates  at  the  surface  of  Iapetus.  At  this  termination  point,  a 
localized flow stoppage occurs and  energy is  released.  Singular point, 
(12),  is  such  a  point  wherein  flow  around  Iapetus  experiences 
adjustment  electrically  as  well  as  physically.  Heretofore,  this  singu-
larity point has  been identified  in Plates 37 and  38  as an isolated light 
source. Uniqueness of this particular source is attributable to its special 
relation  to  the  electro-potential  field  around  Iapetus.  Other  light 
sources  are  vehicle  related  and  identify  localized  regions  at  which

A  model  approximating  an  electro-potential  field  around  Iapetus 
can  be  calculated  from  equations  governing  ideal  fluid  flow  past  a 
sphere.  These  equations  are  also  the  same  ones  which  describe  an 
analogous  electrical flow field around  a  sphere.  Plate  40  pictorializes 
an  ideal  electro-potential  flow  field  for  a  conducting  sphere  located 
between bi-level voltage sources. Part (a) depicts the current paths and 
part (b), the streamlines or equi-potential* lines as they are sometimes 
called. 

In  Plate  40,  a  cross-section  of a  conducting  sphere,  (1),  is  located 
between  a  high-voltage  source,  (2),  and  a  low-voltage  source,  (3).  In 
part  (a),  electrical  current  travels  from  the  high-voltage  source  (top) 
to  the  low-voltage  source  (bottom).  In  traveling  from  high  to  low 
potential,  the  obstructing  sphere  induces  the  current  paths  to  bend 
Some  current  paths  pass  through  the  sphere  as  indicated  by  dashed 
lines.  Those  paths  which  enter  and  exit  do  so  perpendicularly  to  the 
circular profile.  In  part (b),  streamlines  are  shown  moving from  right 
to  left.  Curvature  of the  streamlines  is  such  as  to  accommodate  the 
circular profile and the straight-line sources (2) and (3). The stagnation 
streamline,  (4),  on  the  axis  of  symmetry  terminates  at  the  circular 
profile.  This terminal locates the up-stream singularity point, (5), also 
known as a stagnation point.  Another singularity point,  (6), exists on 
the  down-stream  side  for  the  ideal-flow  condition  assumed.  In  high-
velocity real flow, though, turbulence prevails on the down-stream side 
preventing formation of coherent streamlines and  a  second  stagnation 
point. 

Electrical-current paths  and  equi-potential paths  exist concurrently 
and occur orthogonally. That is, the two types of paths simultaneously 
occur  mutually  perpendicular  to  one  another.  Plate  41  illustrates a 
network of current and equi-potential paths calculated for ideal flow in 
front of a sphere.  Flow proceeds toward the sphere, (1), from the right 
as  indicated  by  the  direction  of  the  equi-potential  paths,  (2).  All 
potential  paths  pass  by  the  sphere.  The  streamline  on  the  axis  of 
symmetry,  (3),  becomes  the  sphere  boundary  commencing  at  the 
stagnation  or  singularity  point,  (4).  In  contrast,  only  those  current 
paths, (5) forward of the stagnation point pass by the sphere. All other 
current  paths,  (6),  immediately  downstream  of the  stagnation  point 
enter  the  sphere  radially.  Intersections  of current  and  equi-potential 
paths  form  a  network  of distorted  squares  and  rectangles.  A  small, 
unique  stagnation  region,  (7),  is  formed  forward  of  the  stagnation 
point. This region is bounded by the sphere, two streamlines astride the 
axis of symmetry, and two current paths.  One current path is aft of the 
stagnation  point  and  enters  the  sphere.  The  other  is  forward  of this 
singularity point and does not enter the sphere. Within the region there 
is  a concentration  of energy corresponding in  location  to  the  isolated 
light source labeled  (4)  in  Plate  38.  Further,  the  network  of distorted 
rectangles  and  squares  resembles  analogously  located  actual  ones 
displayed by  Iapetus  in Plates 38 and 39. 

*Equi-potential  is  a  short  form  of  the  words  "equal  potential"  and  means  that  a  sing 
streamline is at the same potential along its entire length.

Additional  information  can  be  deduced  about  Iapetus.  Plate  42 
illustrates  Iapetus  constrained  by  the  forward  electro-potential  field 
of  an  electromagnetic  vehicle  as  rendered  from  Plates  38  and  39. 
Constraint physically is quite real in that substantial forces are present 
in  the  field.  For  example,  streamline  flow,  (1)  from  the  right  forces 
Iapetus  toward the left (white arrow); but tongue, (2), prevents lateral 
movement  (black  arrow).  In  the  vertical  direction,  Iapetus  is  pushed 
away from  the  vehicle body,  (3),  by  underbody emissions,  (4),  (black 
arrow).  This  push  is  balanced  by  an  opposing force  generated  by the 
asymmetrical  flow  (white  arrow).  Balanced  forces  maintain  Iapetus 
at  a  steady  position  relative  to  the  vehicle.  However,  were  forces 
unbalanced,  the  satellite  would  drift  into  a  different  orbit.  Though 
orbital-path  changes  have not  been  cited  over long-term  observations 
of  Iapetus,  a  vehicle  mechanism  for  moving  the  satellite  nevertheless 
does exist.

Exposure of Iapetus to the electro-potential field illustrated by Plate 
42 will leave divers surface scars when the field disappears. The tongue, 
for  example,  will  leave  a  long,  broad  depression  with  spidery  edges. 

Turbulent flow and  electrolytic*  action  over  the  surface  will  produce 
deposits,  the  composition  of  which  derives  from  emitted  vehicle 
products.  Most  pre-existing  topographical  prominences  within  the 
flow  will  undergo  severe  erosion.  Depending  upon  circumstances, 
prominences  might  assume  streamlined  shapes  from  coherent flow or 
peculiar  forms  due  to  turbulence.  Electrical-current  entry  and  exit 
areas  will  be  marked  by  craters  whose  interiors  are  pitted  from  stray 
subordinate  fingers  of  current.  Dominantly,  however,  prolonged 
application  of heat from  the  tongue  and  underbody emissions  will,  in 
time,  melt  the  surface.  Evidence  of current-formed  craters  and  other 
formations will be erased  and, in turn,  the surface will be left smooth. 
Observers  of Iapetus  have  wondered  how  the  iceous  region,  being 
shadowed  from  the  sun,  can  be  so  intensely  bright.  They  have 
wondered  how  the  iceous  surface  can  change  so  abruptly  into  a 
radically  different  asphaltic  composition.  They  have  wondered  about 
unexpected  flashes  of light,  large  variations  in  surface  reflectivity  and 
sudden disappearances from view. The mystery is resolved completely 
and  satisfactorily  by  the  nearby  presence  of an  active electromagnetic 
vehicle.

PART IV 

GLIMPSE  OF  A  BIGGER  PICTURE 


================================================================
CHAPTER 10. The Lunar  Connection 

Dione and  Iapetus both have been subjected to  the burning fury of 
visitation  from  an  electromagnetic  vehicle.  Each  has  experienced 
topographical  structuring  caused  by  various  emissions  which  these 
high-potential units possess.  In the case of Iapetus,  structuring can be 
deduced  to  be  much  more  than  a  surface  phenomenon.  In  being 
subjected  to  the  observed  electro-potential  field,  electrical  currents 
enter  Iapetus,  converge  within  the  interior,  then  exit.  Surface-
distributed entry currents combine to reach a large magnitude near the 
center.  Consequently,  a  situation  is  established  wherein  considerable 
heating of the core occurs, perhaps to the extent of producing a molten 
constituency.  Simultaneously,  a  situation  also  is  created  whereby ex-
traneous material  is  shedded  at the surface  as current  shafts enter the 
satellite.  This  latter  situation  is  supported  by  photographic  observa-
tions of dark material on the periphery of Iapetus where current paths 
have been  found  to  enter. 

Besides deposits,  visitations  are evidenced  by a wide  assortment of 
surface  scars.  Most  familiar  are  craters  of widely  ranging  diameters. 
Other scars are in the form of rills, ridges and thermo-set areas having 
surfaces  of indistinct  features.  Dione  exhibits  mostly  distinct  craters, 
rills  and  ridges  whereas  Iapetus  displays  a  dimpled  surface  with 
indistinct  features.  Differences  can  be  attributed  to  the  particular 
vehicle  component  creating  the  scar  and  the  amount  of  attendant 
heating.  For  a  given  electromagnetic  vehicle,  the  maximum  diameter 
for a round  scar (e.g.,  a crater) would be a  size approximating vehicle 
body  diameter.  Because  these  spacecraft  have  long-range  cruise 
capability,  any  solar-system  body  becomes  a  suspect  candidate  for 
having experienced visitations. 

A  generalized  scientific  concept  must  fit  circumstances  other  than 
the  particulars  from  which  it  derives.  Additional  situations  involving 
Saturn  and  environs  act  mainly  to  augment  particulars.  Moreover, 
available  topographical  imagery  is  rather sketchy and  too  wanting in 
overall  detail  for  demonstrating  application  using  other  Saturnian 
satellites.  Earth's moon,  on the other hand,  enjoys  the most complete 
and  highly  detailed  mapping  of all  the  celestial  bodies.  Furthermore, 
remote  independency  exists  with  respect  to  the  Saturnian  complex 
Consequently,  earth's  moon  makes  an  ideal  candidate  with  which  to 
test  the concept  of vehicle-created  surface  scars.

6.  Radial  markings 

Of all  the lunar scars,  those of Mare  Orientale  or  Eastern  Sea rank 
among the most spectacular and  noteworthy.  This lunar feature is not 
familiar  to  most  earth  inhabitants  because  of its  unfavorable  location 
for viewing.  Specifically,  Mare Orientale sits astride  the western limit 
of moon visibility from earth, with only eastern ridges of its huge basin 
barely  exposed  to  sight.  Compound  surface  scars  can  be  compre-
hended best by viewing them in global perspective. As an aid, Plate 43 
presents Mare Orientale as portrayed on an official moon globe.* The 
central  region  consists  of two  concentric,  near-circular ridges  stretch-
ing bi-laterally across the western visibility limit,  (1).  The outer ridge, 
(2), has a diameter of about 965 km (600 mi); and the inner ridge, (3), 
has  a  diameter  of about  550  km  (340  mi).  These  ridges  surround  a 
center  pit,  (4),  whose  breadth  is  of  the  order  of  240  km  (150  mi). 
Photographic mosaics of the area reveal that this pit is a deep hole, and 
not  a  smooth  continuum  of a  broad  basin.  The  floor  of the  hole  is 
reported to contain patches of dark basaltic material. Additionally, the 
mosaics  show  a  glazed  surface,  (5),  around  the  eastern  periphery. 
Radially  disposed  markings  of  rills  and  ridges,  (6),  occur  on  the 
northern  and  southern  sides.  In  the  north  and  south,  these  radial 
markings are found within an included  angle of about  100 degrees.  In 
the east and west though,  radial markings definitely are absent within 
the  remaining  angular  area.  Instead,  different  markings  prevail. 
Incomplete radial symmetry negates meteor impact in that a hit should 
produce  full-circle radial  splash marks. 

Surface scars  and markings  on celestial  bodies long have  been used 
as  indicators  of earlier  events.  Typically,  craters  have  been  cited  as 
evidence  that  meteors,  or  showers  of  meteors,  have  impacted  in 
prehistoric  times.  Thus,  scars  and  markings  are,  in  themselves, 
informational data;  and interpretation of their geometry and contents 
has  become acceptable practice.  Now,  let  us examine  Mare Orientale 
without preconceived  notions  regarding its  formation,  and  permit the 
configuration  to  speak  for  itself. 

Plate 44 presents a configuration interpretation of lunar markings at 
Mare  Orientale  utilizing  an  official  NASA  moon  globe.  In  the  plate, 
region  (1) delineates  the central hole,  and circles (2)  and  (3)  the inner 
and outer ridges, respectively.  Rook Mountains is the name which has 
been  given  to  the  inner  ridge  and  Cordillera  Mountains,  to  the  outer 
ridge.  Line  (4)  circumscribes  the  southernmost  exhibit  of  radial 
markings.  This  exhibit  is  separated  by  a  serpentine  strip,  (5)  which 
terminates at the south pole about  1600 km (1000 mi) distant. Another 
interpretation  in  pattern  occurs  at  the  southern  extremity  of  the 
Cordillera  Mountains.  There,  a  short  section  of  mountain  range 
deviates  significantly from  a circular contour.  Accordingly,  the  outer-
ridge  circle  can  be  described  as  having  a  "trough"  in  it  due  to  this 
deviation.  An  "inverted  trough"  is  formed  above  by  small  rills  and 
ridges  between  the  inner  and  outer  ridges.  The  resulting  enclosure, 
which approximates an oblate ellipse,  (6),  encompasses surface which 
is  relatively  smooth  compared  with  surface  outside  the  oblate  en-
closure. 

Manufactured  by  the  Geographical  Globe  Division  of  Meredith  Corporation,  Chicago, 
Illinois,  this globe simulates lunar topography as depicted  by photography from various  NASA 
circumlunar  missions.

Due north of the outer ridge, a bulbar band of terrain, (7), is outlined 
longitudinally by two undulating lines. Terrain between these two lines 
exhibits  surface  features  which  change  rather  abruptly  across  the 
boundaries.  For  example,  there  are  radial  markings  terminating just 
inside  the  boundary  line  on  the  right;  on  the  left,  there  is  a  smooth 
rippled  surface changing to  a pitted  one;  and in  the middle,  there  are 
numerous  closely-packed  and  overlapped  craters.  This  localized 
admixture  of non-homogeneous  surfaces  suggests  that  simultaneous 
events  of  common  origin  are  needed  to  produce  the  topography 
shown. 

A physical mechanism which could create the bulbar-shaped region 
portrayed  in  Plate  44  is  an  overlying  impinging  high-temperature 
pinched-plasma  flow.  Centrally  within  band  boundaries,  closely-
packed  and  overlapped  craters would  be  formed  by  electrical-current 
arcs  which jump  repeatedly  from  the  pinched-plasma  flow  to  ground 
(i.e., to the surface). That the central region should be most cratered is 
consistent with this area being the shortest electrical route between the 
impinging  flow  and  the  surface.  Adjacent  to  the  eastern  and  western 
sides  of the  outer  ridge,  the  terrain  displays  a  knurled  character  and 
includes  some  small  rills  and  ridges.  Propitious  location  of this  latter 
terrain  with  relation  to  the  Mare  basin  "facial"  outline  suggests  the 
terminology  "eastern  ear",  (8),  and  "western  ear"  (9).  Unenclosed 
markings,  (10),  consisting of rills,  ridges,  rivulets and  small craters in 
tandem,  radiate  outward  and  upward  from  these  ears.  All  patterns 
heretofore  described  reasonably  are  interpretable  as  being  family-
related with respect to  the Mare central hole and basin. 

Collectively  viewed  in  perspective,  composite  diagnostic  markings 
of the  Mare  Orientale  moonscape  pictorially  describe  an  elementary 
frontal image of an electromagnetic vehicle.  Reality of the extraordin-
arily  broad  Mare  Orientale  vehicle-caused  imprint  can  be  compre-
hended with visual assistance from a combination model of moon and 
vehicle. 

Plate 45 shows a model electromagnetic vehicle and a NASA official 
moon  globe  co-scaled  and  positioned  to  illustrate  formation  of Mare 
Orientale  as  developed  pictorially  in  Plate  44.  The  nose  end  of  the 
vehicle  model  appears  at the  right positioned  to have center-to-center 
alignment with the  Mare Orientale hole  and  basin.  Body diameter,  to 
the scale of the lunar globe, is 965 km (600 mi). This small-scale model 
is  a  highly  simplified  replica  of the  vehicle  identified  near  Iapetus  in 
Plate  38.  Component-item  details  have  been  sculptured  to  simulate 
those suggested by imagery of Plates 30 and 38. Direct correspondence 
between  specific  lunar-surface  areas  and  particular  vehicle  compon-
ents  becomes  apparent when  the  two  bodies  are co-aligned  as  shown.

vehicle components.

In  addition to  the preceding 9  major items  of matching surface and 
body  configuration,  some  minor  items  also  fall  into  place.  For 
example,  random  crater  formations  within  any  lunar  surface-area 
element  can  arise  from  spurious  electrical  currents  which  arc  from 
vehicle  to  surface.  Also,  numerous  tiny  craters  can  be  pierced  by 
branches from constituent strands comprising larger currents.  Patches 
of  "foreign"  material  can  be  deposited  in  various  topographical 
patterns  by  electro-chemical  processes  due  to  presence  of an  electro-
potential field. Further,  intense  heat  from  the  axial-exhaust  core  can 
explain  an  apparent  glazed  surface  which  surrounds  the  central  hole. 
Thus, wide-scope consistency prevails concerning formative character-
istics of Mare Orientale. Broad consistency, such as found here, usually 
is a mark of correct analysis. 

Ancient  lunar  presence  of  an  electromagnetic  vehicle  at  Marie 
Orientale can  resolve other perplexities concerning the moon.  One  of 
these  perplexities  is  that  a  significant  magnetic  field,  according  to 
evidence, must have existed on the moon about 3 to 4 billion years ago 
Interestingly, the age of Mare Orientale independently has been pegged 
at about  3  to 4 billion years.  Discovery that the unorthodox sectorial 
illumination  of Iapetus  is  attributable  directly  to  the  presence  of an 
encompassing  electro-potential  field  leads  to  a  tentative  conclusion 
about  the  long-extinct  lunar  magnetic  field.  Specifically,  the  con-
clusion  is  reached  that  the  moon  has,  at  some  time,  experienced  the 
same  treatment  as  Iapetus.  According  to  Plates  44  and  45,  an 
identifiable  time  at  which  the  moon  has  undergone  magnetizing 
influences  is  from  an  electromagnetic  vehicle  while  forming  Mare 
Orientale.  Co-supportive  ages  of  Mare  Orientale  and  ancient  lunar 
magnetism inferentially age-dates  the mechanism responsible.  Specifi-
cally,  the  conclusion  can  be  drawn  that  electromagnetic  vehicles 
themselves  have  been  around  for  a  long  time  -  at  least  3  to  4  billion 
years. 

That  electromagnetic  vehicles  are  connected  anciently  to  lunar 
formations distinctly opens a strong possibility of a past intimacy with 
earth.  Implications  to  this  effect  already  have  been  signaled  by 
terrestrial rocks which date back to about the same birth date as Mare 
Orientale.  A  lunar  connection  with  electromagnetic  vehicles  neither 
abrogates  nor  conflicts  with  data  obtained  from  moon-orbiter  mis-
sions  and  landing  excursions.  This  integral  posture  is  much  more 
substantial  than  concepts  which  explain  prehistoric  data  only  for 
narrow  circumstances. 


================================================================
CHAPTER 11. A  Perspective 

Existence  of  extraterrestrial  space  vehicles  of  enormous  size  and 
power is a fact,  the significance  of which is difficult to  grasp, let alone 
assess.  Departing now from the tedious fact-development process,  this 
chapter stands back and takes a philosophical look at  findings. 

In  the  foreground  is  an  immediate  question,  "Are  there  extra-
terrestrial  beings?"  A  short  answer  is,  "Probably".  All  photograph 
negatives examined  by the author have  revealed  no  direct evidence of 
beings.  However,  a  strong  implication  that  extraterrestrials  do  exist 
arises  from  electromagnetic  vehicles  being  positionable.  A  source  of 
intelligence is required to accomplish stability and control for position-
ing.  This  observation  is  a  fall  out  from  noting  that  the  inner  and 
outer  diameters  of  Saturn's  A,  B,  and  C  rings  have  remained 
substantially,  but  not  identically,  the  same  over  a  period  of  years. 
From  a  design  viewpoint,  electromagnetic  vehicles  represent  ultra-
superlative achievements in nuclear physics, aeronautics, astronautics, 
magnetohydrodynamics  and  engineering.  Inferentially,  such  attain-
ments only could be achieved  by a long-term,  goal-oriented,  non-self-
destructing  society. 

Electromagnetic vehicles  possess  obvious devastational  capabilities 
which might evoke fear and  anxiety in some people. These discomfort-
ing  emotions  can  be  alleviated  upon  realization  that  these  powerful 
vehicles  have  been  around  for many,  many centuries;  and  the  human 
race still continues.  In terms of a clear and present danger, man-made 
nuclear bombs pose more of an immediate large- scale threat to human 
life.  In  contrast,  an  apparent  long-term  commitment  by  electro-
magnetic  vehicles  to  the  continuance  of  the  human  life  chain  is 
comforting. 

To  anticipate,  though,  a  perpetually  unmarred  status  quo  in  the 
character of our earthly habitat is  really an unreasonable expectation. 
To illustrate,  a  sudden change in  the surface of the  Earth occurred  30 
June  1908. On this day, a violent thunderous explosion rocked an area 
near  Tunguska  in  Central  Siberia,  USSR.  Twelve  hundred  square 
miles  became  devastated.  Small  villages  and  wildlife  disappeared 
during this blast. A large forest was flattened. According to eye-witness 
accounts,  a  flaming  cylindrical  object  was  sighted  in  the  vicinity just 
prior  to  the  explosion.  After  years  of  intensive  study  and  scientific 
research,  a firm conclusion  has  been  drawn  that  the  devastation  had 
been caused by an aerial nuclear explosion. Supporting this conclusion 
is the Hiroshima nuclear-bomb destruction which produced a surface-
devastation  pattern  similar  to  that  recorded  at  Tunguska.  Some 
scientists  go  farther  with  an  assertion  that  the  devastation  had  been 
caused  by  an  extraterrestrial  spaceship  which  exploded.  After  all 
nuclear bombs had not been invented at the time of the 1908 explosion; 
and furthermore,  they submit,  there were eyewitnesses. 

The Tunguska  story affirms the existence of cylindrical vehicles and 
their  nuclear  character.  This  affirmation  is  quite  important  in  that 
science now harbors bona fide repeat observations of these ultra-high-
energy  units  in  the  solar  system.  A  concentrated  presence  of  them 
appears at Saturn, thereby introducing the interesting speculation that 
the planet serves as an operational base. 

Ultra-superlative intellect is implied by the existence of these highly 
sophisticated electromagnetic vehicles. Not only do these units demon-
strate  mastery  of  nuclear  power  and  massive  electro-potential  force 
fields,  but also they show an ability to modify extensive surface areas of 
large celestial bodies.  Indeed, a realistic possibility is raised that good-
sized  celestial  bodies  can  be  moved  about.  These  capabilities  clearly 
place  the  human  race  at  a  comparative  disadvantage.  To  cite  a 
practical  example,  the  Tunguska  explosion  demonstrates  that  an 
electromagnetic  vehicle,  should  it  elect  to  strike  a  densely  populated 
area,  could  inflict  massive  human  termination.  While  wide-spread 
catastrophic  destruction  in  the  past  may  have  occurred,  such  as  that 
which  wiped  out  the  dinosaurs,  presently  a  compassionate  policy  of 
forbearance  seems  to  be  in effect. 

Forbearance of catastrophic destruction does not imply forbearance 
of lesser  destruction.  That  is,  narrowly  spread  destruction  might  be 
occurring  continually.  Several  possibilities  present  themselves.  Quite 
conceivably, electromagnetic vehicles could be generators of tornadoes 
and hurricanes. In certain instances, inexplicable, sudden, intense fires 
also might be attributable to these space-craft. A likely simple example 
is  transformer  fires  at  the  top  of power  poles.  A  much  more  subtle 
possibility might  be electromagnetic alteration  of human  body  tissues 
inasmuch  as  electrical  fields  attendant  with  vehicles  can  extend  over 
thousands  of miles.  Of these  possibilities,  weather  is  the  easiest  with 
which to  relate. 

With  the  advent  of television,  various components  of weather  have 
become common knowledge.  For example, continental high- and low-
temperature  distributions,  hot-  and  cold-air  masses  or  fronts, 
barometric  pressure  variations,  and  dynamic  cloud  formations  have 
become  terminology  familiar  to  most  newscast  viewers.  Wind,  rain, 
snow, humidity, lightning and thunder showers are explained using the 
aforesaid  terminology.  Weather  terminology  permits  dialogue  con-
cerning what is  transpiring,  but it does not  get  to  the  root of weather 
inception.  Were  weather  inception  understood,  weather  would  be 
predictable.  As is well  known,  weather is not predictable.  Despite all 
the  technical  dissertations  and  theories  over  the  years,  inception  of 
Earth weather remains  a mystery. 

At  least  part  of  Earth's  weather  no  longer  is  a  mystery.  A  new 
weather  component  termed  "dry  lightning"  has  crept  quietly  into 
weather  descriptions.  Prior  to  invention  of  this  term,  lightning  had 
been  associated  only  with  the  presence  of  cloud  formations.  This 
situation  has  changed.  Lightning  is  being  reported  in  clear  blue  sky 
absolutely devoid  of clouds.  Thus,  lightning in waterless  sky is called 
dry  lightning.  Categorically,  illuminated  electrical  currents  around 
Iapetus qualify as dry lightning in that these currents occur in absence 
of water clouds.  Saturnian  lightning shown  in Plate  16  also  qualifies. 
Interestingly,  electrical  currents  of  Iapetus  and  Saturnian  lightning 
bolts are generated by electromagnetic vehicles. These findings support 
a  proposition  that dry  lightning in  Earth's  atmosphere  is  a  proximity 
indicator of one  or more  of these  powerful  bodies. 

Electromagnetic  vehicles  might  be  viewed  as  superimposing  their 
weather-making  influences  upon  Earth's  inherent  weather  compon-
ents  or  alternatively,  as  weather  instigators.  Both  concepts  are 
regarded  as  posing  no  conflict  with  weather-model  efforts.  Rather, 
knowledge of vehicle presence can aid modeling efforts. For example, a 
reason  becomes available  for adding or subtracting energy in  order to 
secure a global heat balance.  Measured shrinking of the Antarctic ice 
cap is a case in point. Heretofore, a heat source has not been available 
to account for known melting. Long-term addition of heat by vehicular 
sources  opens  new  avenues  for  modeling  weather  and  global  heat 
balance. 

On  each  extremity  of  Saturn's  rings,  cylindrical  bodies  have  been 
photographed  spewing  emissions.  These  emissions  assume  com-
plicated  patterns  while  contributing  compositional  material  for  the 
rings.  A  time-varying  appearance  of  Saturn's  disc  is  a  natural 
consequence of this process.  The  B  ring and  inner- and  outer-A rings 
are  separate  entities  because  different  vehicles  fabricate  these  rings, 
intervening spaces, such as the Cassini and Enke divisions, are safety-
buffer regions to preclude vehicle collisions. Therefore, nothing needs 
to  "scoop  out"  these divisions  in  order to  create  open  space.  Indeed 
the  Cassini  and  Enke  gaps  may  contain  something  or  nothing  at  all 
depending  on whether emissions are permitted  to  intrude. 

A number of vehicles have been identified within Saturn's ring disc 
In a sense, Saturn's disc can be considered a huge, polluted parking lot 
or rendezvous,  for extraterrestrial spacecraft.  Density and thickness of 
this  pollution can  vary  considerably  according  to  the  number  of craft 
present,  their  positioning  and  modes  of  operation.  Presence  of 
electromagnetic vehicles near other planets is intimated by a finding of 
rings, the signature left by exhaust and emission products persisting in 
orbit.  These  sophisticated  pollutants  trigger  a  realization  that  manmade
 products and processes may not be the sole cause of Earth's dirty 
atmosphere.  For  example,  electromagnetic  vehicles  might  provide  a 
partial  answer  regarding  why  acid  rain  sometimes  occurs  in  regions 
having  no  terrestrial  acid-rain-making  capabilities.  Quite  possibly,  a 
challenging  new  era  may  lie  ahead  concerning  governmental  man-
agement  efforts  to  maintain  environmentally clean  air. 

During  the  flyby  of Saturn  and  its  moons,  Voyager  1  observed  15 
satellites.  Except for one, Titan, these satellites have been identified as 
being covered with water ice, either wholly or partially. Water ice even 
is  postulated  to  be  a  major  constituent  of  Saturn's  rings.  Such 
extraordinary  prevalence  of  common  ice  is  quite  significant.  Icy 
Iapetus is a case in point, as positive identification has been made of a 
cylindrical  vehicle  positioned  nearby.  This  situation  justifies  an 
assertion  that  the  icy  surface  may  be  a  result  of water  having  been 
generated  by  an  electromagnetic  vehicle  and  shaped  later  in  a  frozen 
state by directed heat applications. Ice-skate-rink smoothness could be 
attained  by  heat  application  from  suitable  body  components  such  as 
axial  exhaust  flame.  Icy  constituency  of  Saturn's  satellites  possibly 
indicates  that  Earth  obtained  its  polar  ice  caps  by  extraterrestrial 
means. 

Some scientists claim that Earth is progressing into another ice age. 
Others  note  definite  increases  in  global  mean  sea  level  and  receding 
glaciers  and  claim  a  significant  warming  trend  which  has  caused 
massive  discharge  of  melted  polar  ice.  In  observing  these  global 
changes,  a  reduction  in  Earth's  rotational  velocity  also  has  been 
detected.  Only  three-fourths  of this  reduction  in  angular  velocity  can 
be accounted  for.  It is conceivable that the other one-fourth might be 
accounted  for  by  a  cylindrical  vehicle  flying  within  Earth's  magnetic 
field.  Such flight would give rise to electromagnetic drag operating on 
the  craft.  Then,  in  accordance  with  the  Newtonian  principle  that  for 
every action there is an equal and  opposite reaction,  a drag on Earth's 
rotation is imputed.  Once  again,  a new variable exists which possibly 
might  fill  a gap in scientific thought. 

Electromagnetic  vehicles  represent  extreme,  ultra-high  technology. 
Earth has nothing remotely comparable with which to compete. So far, 
development of a competing technology is not an obviously compelling 
need. What is compelling, however, is the need for a much deeper and 
broader  understanding.  To  illustrate,  on  22  September  1979  a  U.S. 
satellite  recorded  a  bright  flash  aloft  between  South  Africa  and 
Antarctica.  After  prolonged  analysis  of the  data,  federal  laboratories 
concluded that the satellite saw a nuclear blast.  During the study,  the 
high-level  White  House  blue-ribbon  analysis  committee  ultimately 
became  divided  into  believers  and  non-believers.  Believers  think  that 
data  from  the  event  match  known  signatures  of nuclear  blasts.  Non-
believers  think  that  some  natural  event  induced  the  satellite  to  make 
an  erroneous  report.  Both  groups  can  be  correct  when  the  blast  is 
attributed to action by an electromagnetic vehicle.  A potentially grave 
hazard  is  posed.  Specifically,  an  international  nuclear  exchange 
inadvertently  could  be  triggered  by  nuclear  events  originated  by  an 
extraterrestrial  third  party.  Electromagnetic  vehicles  will  hold  the 
balance of power for centuries to come. Lest extraterrestrial interlopers 
unsuspectingly  induce  nuclear  warfare,  a  unified  world  should  be  a 
matter for serious consideration.  Moreover, catastrophic extinction of 
the human race is a realistic threat which needs to be addressed. 

Researchers  have  established  that  Earth  has  experienced  catastrophic  
large-scale  life  extinctions  about  every  26  million  years.  One 
of  these  extinctions,  that  of  dinosaurs,  is  theorized  to  have  been 
caused  by impact  of a huge meteor  striking  Earth.  Other possibilities 
are  a  comet  or  an  electromagnetic  vehicle.  Had  Comet  1979  XI,  de-
tected by U.S. Navy satellite F-78-1, hit Earth instead of the sun on 30 
August  1979, a catastrophic extinction no doubt would have occurred. 
Close  inspection  of the  before-collision  photographs  suggests  a  long 
body  having  emissions  closely  resembling  those  pictured  in  Plates  7 
and 8! 

Comets  actually may be directed  electromagnetic vehicles traveling 
at  high  speed.  This  assertion  is  supported  by  a  satellite  picture  of 
Comet  IRAS-Araki-Alcock  (1983).  One  equilibration  is  that  the 
nucleus of this comet can be construed to have a fineness ratio of about 
12 to  13.  Another  equilibration  is  that the  nucleus  possesses  features 
similar to the body shown in Plate 6.  To wit,  part of the slender-body 
nucleus is intensely white, and the remainder a darker color. Moreover, 
other comets,  specifically  Kohoutek (1973-74) and  Bennett (1970) can 
be interpreted as an electromagnetic vehicle projecting a fire-ball ahead 
of the body. As has been shown, electromagnetic vehicles have fire-ball 
generating  capability.  These  bodies  most  certainly  are  suitable 
mechanisms  for  causing  catastrophic  extinctions,  with  an  attendant 
possibility  that  their missions  are controlled.  Collisions  may  not  be a 
necessary  condition  for  catastrophe;  a  near-miss  might  well  be 
sufficient. 

Planetary  rings  are  an  indicator  of  past,  or  current,  presence  of 
electromagnetic vehicles.  Jupiter and  Uranus both are known to have 
rings.  The  sun  has  been discovered  to  have  a  ring  of globular matter 
surrounding it.  Our own asteroid belt is a ring.  Even a ring around the 
solar  system  is  believed  to  exist.  Discovery  of others  practically  is  a 
certainty.  For  example,  no  surprise  should  occur  if planetary  nebula 
NGC  6781  were  found  to  emanate  from,  and  be  a  property  of,  a 
superbly large electromagnetic vehicle.  This concept poses no conflict 
with  the  notion  that  the  nebula  ring  results  from  radial  expansion  of 
matter from a central  source. 

Jupiter,  Uranus and NGC 6781  are far away.  Therefore,  one might 
submit that events at such remote places have no importance to human 
beings.  Maybe. Though also far away, activity at the sun more readily 
is acceptable as a concern. An example might be that some solar  flares 
are highly correlatable with anomolous terrestrial weather.  Generally, 
any  major interference  with  solar  functioning,  such  as  by  object  1979 
XI,  operates  temporarily to  alter  Earth  weather.  These  occasions  are 
marked on the sun by abnormal electrical-field patterns which interact 
with  those  of Earth.  Anomolous  sun  activity,  by  triggering  weather 
changes,  in  turn  can  occasion  severe  down-stream  socio-economic 
impacts.  Electromagnetic  vehicles  also  may  operate  quite  remotely 
from  the  sun,  yet  directly  exert  significant  physical  effects  on  Earth. 
Severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, flooding, droughts and certain types 
of fires  all  might  be  symptomatic.  Even  less  obvious  might  be  subtle 
effects  exerted  on  the  human  body  by  innocent  exposure  to  focused 
electro-potential  fields. 

Photographic data recorded impersonally by satellite stand on their 
own  without  having to  doubt a human photographer.  No  need  exists 
for a protective requirement that several independent cameras witness 
the same thing as a condition precedent to credibility. For a sighting of 
an  unidentified  flying  object,  an  analyst  may  require  three  or  more 
observers  of the  same  object  as  a  condition  precedent  to  credibility-
Information  output,  though  small  and  tending  toward  high  quality, 
still  is  inadequate  compared  with  hard  data  provided  by  remotely 
procured photographs.  Unidentified flying objects (UFO's) being on a 
soft  data  base  incomparable  with  a  hard  base  for  the  electromagnetic 
vehicles (E.M.V.'s) reported herein,  they necessarily must be, and are, 
excluded  from  discussion. 



As  a  practical  matter,  technical  discussion  of  UFO's  virtually  is 
never possible even with absolutely valid information.  The fact is that 
there  are,  and there always will be,  UFO's.  The reason  simply is  that 
substantially  all  witnesses  are  equipped  inadequately  to  describe  or 
interpret what they see in terms of a physical discipline.  Consequences 
of  this  limitation  can  be  illustrated  by  an  hypothetical  early  1940's 
scenario.  In  this  scenario,  a  German  pilot  and  an American  pilot  are 
flying  adversarial  combat  missions  against  one  another.  Piloting  the 
first  operational jet-powered  airplane, the  German forces 
the American  into  escape  maneuvers.  Fortuitously  returning  from  the 
engagement,  the  American  reports  to  headquarters  that  he  had 
encountered  a  UFO.  He  substantiates  his  position by  stating that  the 
high-speed object matches nothing he had been briefed on or taught to 
recognize.  His  account  documents  that  the  object  had  no  propellers. 
He notes that engine-driven propellers are the only known method for 
sustaining  aerial  flight.  The  point  is  that  insufficient  information  is 
available to  the pilot for resolving identity.  In contrast,  identity of the 
propeller-less  object  quite  likely  would  have  been  resolved  as  a jet-
powered airplane had the encounter been experienced and reported by 
Sir Frank Whittle. Sir Frank is the Englishman knighted in  1948 for his 
invention  of the jet engine. 



That  identification  and  resolution  capability  lags  behind  developed 
knowledge is exemplified  by the  first-jet-airplane  scenario.  This lag is 
substantiated  by  the  1908  Tunguska,  Siberia  explosion.  Terrible 
destruction  of the  land,  extraordinary  human-tissue  burns  and  wide-
spread  obliteration  of  wild  life  could  not  be  explained  at  first. 
Knowledge gained years later from the  1945 Hiroshima explosion shed 
light on a myriad  of puzzlements.  Similarity of topographical destruc-
tion  in  the  two  events  clinches  conviction  that  the  Tunguska  blast 
came  from  a  nuclear  explosion  aloft.  Terrestrial  nuclear-explosion 
knowledge, coming as it did  37 years later,  inescapably pinpoints the 
source  to  one  of extraterrestrial  origin. 

Though  the  Tunguska  analysis  is  substantial  and  thorough  some 
scientists,  without cause,  choose not to  recognize the conclusions.  By 
doing  so,  in  effect  they  position  themselves  to  promulgate  their  own 
party  line.  Substituting  for  years  of  painstaking  investigation,  an 
unsubstantiated  allegation  is  made  that  the  Tunguska  event  results 
from impact of a huge meteor.  A meteor impact simply does not fit all 
known  facts  sufficiently  well  to  render  the  allegation  credible.  This 
incongruent  situation  serves  to  focus  attention  on  a  possible  need  to 
interrogate vigorously perpetuated explanations for certain aspects of 
the  solar  system  and  the  universe.  Repetitious  publication  tends  to 
cause unqualified explanations to become accepted without challenge 
The role of science, starting with Copernicus and Galileo, has been to 
ascertain physical truth.  This long-standing scientific approach should 
continue  to  be  pursued.  Pursuance  of  the  approach  may  lead  to 
devaluation of personal property, such as that represented by publica-
tions;  but  unfortunately,  such  abrogation  is  a  hazard  of the  scientific 
process  of correcting  and  updating  understanding. 

More aeronautical history of the 1940's will serve to illustrate some 
lessons  pertinent  to  advancing  state-of-the-art  in  astronomy  and 
aerospace  science. 

A theory exists which says that a physical body can never reach the 
speed of light because an infinite force is required. The same theoretical 
argument was made for airplanes relative to the speed  of sound in the 
1940's.  Aerodynamic theory holds that for a finite wing inclined in an 
airstream,  lift  and  drag  approach  infinity  near  the  speed  of  sound. 
With drag infinitely large,  "breaking-the-sound-barrier"  theoretically 
is impossible because, again, an infinite force is required. 

Despite a theoretical limit on the speed of flight in air, Frank Whittle 
believed  that were  sufficient  finite  force  applied  to  an  object,  it  would 
move  faster  than  the  speed  of  sound.  Application  of  Sir  Frank 
Whittle's  jet  engine  to  airplanes  confirmed  this  belief.  The  same 
contention that  Sir Frank made for exceeding the speed of sound also 
can  be  made  for  exceeding  the  speed  of  light.  After  all,  the  basic 
electromagnetic equations are identical to the aerodynamic equations, 
except  for  magnitude  of  the  constants  of  proportionality.  In  this 
context, the speed of light simply is a reference speed analogous to, and 
greater  in  magnitude  than,  the  speed  of sound.  Speed  of light  is  very 
close to  six orders  of magnitude greater than the speed of sound under 
standard  atmospheric  conditions. 

Considering  the  evidenced  ultra-high  nuclear  technology,  flight 
speeds  for  E.M.V.'s  greater  than  the  speed  of  light  technically  is  a 
realistic  expectation.  Successful  operational  achievement  is  keyed 
fundamentally to development of a low-weight engine in relation to the 
propulsive  force  delivered.  This  development  is  exactly  the  same  one 
Sir  Frank  Whittle  attained  on  behalf  of  supersonic  flight.  With 
supersonic  flight  as  a  comparable  historical  precedent,  superlumenal 
flight  definitely  should  be  regarded  as  being  within  the  domain  of 
reality. 

Potential  reality  of  superlumenal  flight  permits  ideas  to  be  con-
sidered  which  heretofore  have  been  excluded.  For  example,  the 
universe is believed to contain much more mass than can be accounted 
for visually.  A  simple  explanation  might  be  that  the  "missing"  mass 
has  superlumenal  speed  and,  therefore,  cannot  be  seen.  The  situation 
can  be  considered  analogous  to  an  observer  being  unable  to  hear  a 
supersonic airplane approaching. In this aerodynamic analogy, a mass 
indeed  is  present;  but  in  terms  of  a  sonic  reference,  the  mass  is 
"missing". 

Presence  of electromagnetic  vehicles  in  the  solar  system  introduces 
likelihood for analogous  similarities in the universe.  When an enlightened  
attitude  is  taken  toward  E.M.V.'s  advancement  of not  only  the 
Sciences but also the Arts and Humanities appears to be filled with new 
excitement. 




PART  V 

SYNTHESIS 


================================================================
CHAPTER 12. The  Status 

Frontiers of knowledge are endless. While knowledge has carried the 
world far in generally favorable directions,  only a short segment of the 
exciting frontiers has been explored. Electromagnetic vehicles, because 
of their huge  size  and  powerful  electrical  capabilities,  are  in  a  far-out 
class  of their  own.  Consequently,  they  must  be  regarded  as  an  ultra-
force  which  transcends  race,  creed,  color,  national  boundaries  and 
forms  of  government.  Implicitly,  Earth  is  granted  conditions  for 
sustenance  of  life  by  the  grace  of  an  identifiable  superior  power. 
Conversely,  this  same  power  has  definite  capability  to  reduce  Earth 
suddenly to a barren waste land like the moon. 

An  emotion  frequently  expressed  by  astronauts  on  returning  to 
Earth is a feeling that Earth is a very special place. Yet there are those 
who  are  willing  to  risk  terminating  Earth's  special  processes  -
processes  which  have  taken  billions  of years  to  attain.  The  trend  is 
dangerous  and  foolhardy. 

Already an extraterrestrial nuclear explosion aloft has been demon-
strated  at  Tunguska  USSR,  and  perhaps  again  in  1979  near  South 
Africa  and  Antarctica.  That  electromagnetic  vehicles  are  real  and 
awesome  can  be  attested  to  by  the  author from  a  sighting  experience 
backed  up  by  photography  and  collaborative  witnesses.  The  now 
confirmed presence of an extraterrestrial nuclear power poses a hazard 
never  contemplated  heretofore.  Specifically,  an  extraterrestrial  in-
terloper could initiate a nuclear blast which might well be confused by 
concerned  terrestrial  nuclear  powers  for  an  adversative  first  strike.  A 
nuclear  exchange  would  ensue  mistakenly,  resulting  in  catastrophic 
destruction on  Earth.  The risk of nuclear exchange between terrestrial 
adversaries  is  escalated  hazardously  because  of  this  unpredictable 
interloper capability. Unless nuclear warfare is abandoned, the task of 
preserving  Earth  and  its  inhabitants  becomes  enormously  difficult 
technically  besides  being inordinately costly. 

A  concept  which  widely  pervades  the  scientific  literature  is  what 
might  be  termed  "dogmatic  Darwinism".  This  expression  connotes 
single-minded  tenure  to  only  the  concept  of  evolution.  Make  no 
mistake,  change  and  hence  "evolution"  has  occurred  and  still  is 
occurring. Electromagnetic vehicles have played, and continue to play 
a  role  in  effecting  change.  Electromagnetic  vehicles,  however,  also 
create.  They  create  rings  of different  types  and  compositions.  They 
create satellite surfaces,  such as that of Iapetus.  Is there any reason to 
think creation stops at this impressive level of achievement? Not at all. 
Just  around  Saturn,  there  are  fairly  ideal  chemical  broths  containing 
life-form  building  blocks.  Dry-lightning  strikes  from  electromagnetic 
vehicles should be able to initiate life-form chemical reactions. Hence 
it can  be  reasoned  that  the  two  concepts,  evolution  and  creation,  are 
both  correct. 

Although inanimate creation has been  shown,  animate creation has 
not.  Extraterrestrial  life  forms  have  yet  to  be  positively  identified 
though  their  presence  is  implied.  Owing  to  the  strange  character  of 
electromagnetic  vehicles,  communicative  language  is  likely  to  be 
obscure as well as subtle. Obviously, a data base needs to be developed 
which  is  oriented  specifically  toward  pin-pointing extraterrestrial  life. 
The  SETI  (Search  for  ExtraTerrestrial  Intelligence)  land-based-
receiver  project  is  a  cognitive  start  in  this  direction.  Monitoring 
equipment,  however,  is  geared  technologically  to  identify  intelligence 
signals  at  the  sophisticated  human  level.  Hopefully,  signals  from 
higher-than-human-intelligence  sources  will  neither  bypass  nor  slip 
undetected  through the  selected filters. 

Many excursions into space by the USA have been made with broad, 
exploratory  flight  objectives.  Consequently,  except  for entertainment, 
the public has not been able to identify specific benefits from huge tax-
dollar  expenditures  for  space  flights.  In  turn,  space  programs  then 
are  criticized  for  diverting  funds  from  allegedly  needed  humanistic 
projects. Reluctance to fund open-end space exploration is not likely to 
change.  Critically  needed  is  a  space  program  designed  especially  to 
define functions served in the solar system by electromagnetic vehicles. 
Their  role  with  respect  to  Earth  and  its  populace  should  be  given 
particular  attention.  For  example,  the  source  of terrestrial  lightning 
should  be  understood  physically  rather  than  accepted  piously  as  a 
fathomless  property  of Nature. 

Electromagnetic  vehicles  most  likely  originate  outside  the  solar 
system.  Hence,  new  avenues  of inquiry can  be  considered concerning 
observed phenomena in the universe. The universe is laden heavily with 
nuclear energy; and apparently some societal intelligence has mastered 
its  application  on  a  large  scale.  Accomplishments  include  massively 
large  engines,  controlled  nuclear  fusion,  planetary-satellite  surface 
modification,  lengthy  transmission  of  huge  electrical  currents,  and 
immensely high-power electro-potential  fields. 

Large-scale events almost beyond comprehension are taking place in 
the  universe.  Saturn, its  rings  and moons,  is a definite hub of activity 
within the solar system.  Because Saturn is relatively close to Earth, this 
region is  focally  a good  one  to  monitor.  Adequate monitoring might 
prove  difficult  owing  to  the  highly-charged  and  nuclear  character  of 
the  environs.  Further,  a  question  is  raised  whether  humans  in 
proximity  will  be  tolerated  by  electromagnetic  vehicles.  Past  events, 
notably the Tunguska explosion and a collision of a large body with the 
sun,  pose  questions  of  serious  concern  to  everyone.  All  in  all, 
compelling reasons are present for outmoding war and re-directing all 
war-related  effort  toward  the  preservation  of humanity. 

================================================================
CHAPTER  13. Epilogue 

Telemetry from Voyager 2 on its outward journey through the solar 
system  shows  that  planet  Uranus  has  a  number  of rings.  One  of the 
published  photographic  transmissions  indicates  that  the  rings  are 
formed mechanistically the  same as  for  Saturn.  The ring-makers even 
lie within the ring at about the same angle as the ones shown for Saturn. 
Interestingly  too,  the  Uranus  moon,  Miranda,  has  a  combination  of 
geological  land  forms  found  separately  on  various  moons  of Saturn. 
Unusual terrain forms include square corners, nestled circular grooves, 
parallel  straight-line  grooves,  and  regions  evidencing  former  viscous 
flow.  Craters  still  are  being  explained  by  meteor  impacts;  but 
unorthodox  terrain  patterns  simply  do  not  fit  this  time-worn  theory! 
Neither  do  these  patterns  fit  conventional  geological  concepts.  In 
contrast,  strange surface  shapes and contours and recent modification 
thereof  readily  are  explicable  in  terms  of  observed  electromagnetic 
vehicle capabilities. 

Presence  of electromagnetic  vehicles  (E.M.V.'s)  in  the  outer  solar 
system  forces  attention  on  an  extraordinary  potential  hazard  of 
manned  space  flight  not  considered  heretofore.  E.M.V.'s  can  be 
expected  to  pose  an  extreme  hazard  to  manned  space  flight  in  the 
vicinity of Saturn and  Uranus,  and probably even as near to  Earth as 
Mars.  Some  pictures  of  Mars  suggest  visitations  by  E.M.V.'s  The 
massive  power  of  E.M.V.'s  means  neither  that  humans  absolutely 
should  forgo  space  flights,  nor  that  a  Mars  landing  should  never  be 
undertaken.  However,  known presence  of E.M.V.'s  serves  a  substan-
tial warning to space travelers at least to stay their distance. Failure to 
heed  this  warning  could  result  in  catastrophe  and  emotional  un-
pleasantness much  worse  than  that which  resulted  from  the explosion 
of space-shuttle  Challenger. 

As  precursors  to  committing  humans  to  remote  space,  the  special 
jurisdiction claimed by E.M.V.'s should be ascertained. Meanwhile, all 
nations  of  the  world  should  unite  to  meet  the  challenges  and 
opportunities  that  these prodigious forces present. 

================================================================
Appendix 

Equating  a  "body having  physically inherent mobile capability"  to 
the term "vehicle"  possibly may be considered as too abrupt a step in 
nomenclature  development.  The  potential  problem  lay  in  various 
connotations  for  the  word.  Multiple  connotations  do  not  lead  to  a 
focused idea concerning what is  meant. 

To  illustrate,  an  automobile  has  inherent  mobile  capability;  and 
reference to an automobile as a vehicle is quite common.  On the other 
hand  for  example,  an  ape  also  has  inherent  mobile  capability;  but 
reference  to  an  ape  as  a  vehicle  is  uncommon  in  the  sense  that  an 
automobile  is  a  vehicle.  That  the  former  is  inanimate  and  the  latter 
animate  is  not  the  intended  distinction.  The  significant  distinction  is 
that an automobile does not occur directly in Nature, whereas an ape is 
regarded  as  a direct  product  of Nature. 

For purpose of the subject matter, the term "vehicle" is meant to be 
something  not  occurring  directly  in  Nature,  but  rather  something 
occurring  as  a  by-product  of Nature.  Early  introduction  of "vehicle" 
as a descriptor is considered by the author to  be,  at worst,  premature 
but not an inaccurate usage. 

The reason for the belief in descriptor accuracy is independent of the 
non-personal  photographic  evidence  presented  herein.  In  1971,  the 
author  had  the  exciting  experience  of  having  sighted  and  photo-
graphed a mobile slender body fitting the specific properties of the two 
bodies  shown  later  in  Plates  5  and  6.  This  sighting  at  the  time  was 
experienced  by  the  author's  wife  and  daughter.  Through  binoculars, 
this  body  appeared  to  be  large  and  incorporated  fine  aerodynamic 
features  at  the  fore  and  aft  exhaust  ends.  That  is,  the  ends  did  not 
terminate squarely cut-off as would result when a pole is sawed in two. 
Rather,  the  ends  were  rounded  much  the  same  as  are  cowls  of jet-
engine intakes.  Bulbar streamers were emitted from locations along the 
body.  Control over these streamers was demonstrated by the modula-
tion  of their activity,  and  also  by introduction  of additional  streamers 
which moved with definite periodicity. 

Drawing  upon  many  years  of  aerospace  experience,  the  author 
has  no  reservation  about  labeling  the  sighted  body  a  vehicle.  The 
numerous and unique properties of the sighted vehicle also are evident 
variously  in  the micro-photographs presented.  Until  more research is 
performed  to  demonstrate  otherwise,  the  bodies  discussed  in  Plate  3 
and  subsequently  shall  be  considered  vehicles  rather  than  objects  of 
Nature.
