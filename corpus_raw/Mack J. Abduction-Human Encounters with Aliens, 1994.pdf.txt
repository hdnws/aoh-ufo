ABDUCTION
HUMAN ENCOUNTERS
WITH ALIENS
John E. Mack, M.D.


"ABSORBING, POWERfUl AND TOUCHING ...
In giving respect to people who have been
misunderstood and mocked, and visibility to a
phenomenon that is ordinarily derided, [Mack] has
performed a valuable and brave service, enlarging
the domain and generosity of the psychiatric
enterprise. Whatever future research may reveal
about the abduction experience, and however much it
may be alloyed with individual psychodynamics and
observer bias, it is also, as Dr. Mack understands, an
aspect of something bigger-an emblem of our
longing for connection to the greater universe in
which we live and a sign of an urgently needed
individual and collective transformation."
-The New York Times Book Review

"John Mack explores evidence of nonhuman intelligence
like an attorney preparing for the 'trial of the century'­
interviewing witnesses, examining physical evidence,
consulting with experts in related fields, constantly
questioning his own assumptions. John Mack's chronicle
of how a remarkable body of data forced him to question
his most deeply rooted beliefs is inspiring and is a
powerful illustration of the fact that true sci�nce and true
spirituality are not at odds. As a story of one man's
determination to bear witness to cosmic mysteries with
extraordinary implications for the human future,
ABDUCTION is bound to become a modern classic."
-KEITH THOMPSON
Author of Angels and Aliens

"John Mack has written a gripping and fascinating book.
As with Frazer's The Golden Bough, as with William
James's Varieties of Religious E�perience, and perhaps
as with the Brothers Grimm, ABDUCTION is a book that
repeatedly leads the reader to psychologically important
sources of wonder about worlds beyond our ken."

PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION

The publication of the hardcover edition of this book in April
1994 met with a strong response, both supportive and critical. I
would like to take the opportunity of the paperback publication to
express my appreciation to those who were open to what I have
been learning. But I also feel that it is important to address some
of the criticisms I have received, especially the charge that the
work is an example of a kind of cult of irrationality, an exercise
in anti-science and unreason.
Upon reviewing the text of the book with the help of colleagues, it is apparent that my growing conviction about the authenticity of these reports, together with a sense of their great
potential significance, resulted in a tendency to write as if the fact
or reality of the experiences was established before the case had
been made. In so doing, I may have denied some readers, especially those who would be naturally skeptical, the opportunity to
make up their own minds. In this revised edition, I have altered
the language in specific places to make clear that I am reporting
the experiences of the abductees as told to me and not presuming
that everything they say is literally true. Whether or not each of
their communications is recorded with qualifying words like "reported that" or "according to," the objective distance between me
and the experiences implicit in such phrases should be understood
throughout the text. Basic clinical scientific questions that have
been raised, such as the status of physical evidence, the role of
subject expectation or investigator influence, the reliability of
memory, the accuracy of hypnosis, and the possibility of alternative explanations have been addressed in Appendix A. Finally, in
order to improve the book's readability, the historical and crosscultural sections have been moved to the back (Appendix B), and
the opening sections that contain my introduction and first reactions to learning about the abduction phenomenon have been
streamlined.
• The most archetypal expression of the cry of anti-science came
from science writer James Gleick in a review in the New Republic
magazine (Gleick 1994 ). Gleick called the "alien-abduction mythology" a "leading case of the anti-rational, anti-science cults that
are flourishing with dismaying vigor in the United States." He
lumps the alien abduction phenomenon together with "paranormals who bend spoons, parapsychologists who sense spiritual auras, crystal healers, believers in reincarnation" and "psychic
crime-solvers" as well as "tarot readers and crystal ball gazers."
In a similar vein psychoanalyst Sanford Gifford, in a review of
my book for a psychoanalytic journal (Gifford, in press), called it
a "subversive assault on psychoanalysis as a science" (he assumes
that the phenomenon must be some sort of product of the unconscious mind), and wrote of the abduction experiencers as individuals "holding irrational beliefs that are not shared by the 'compact
majority.' " In that sense, he continued, "they are 'crazy' in the
same way as believers in Creationism, faith healing, thought transference, or the end of the world on a specific date." Music critic
(!) Milo Miles, reviewing Abduction in The Boston Globe worried
that "the secular world and the spirit world must be kept as separate as church and state." He concludes that "Mack should beware that if rationality and objective truth are thrown out the door,
no one can predict what will rush in through the opening (Miles
1994)."
I believe these critiques reflect a misunderstanding of the nature
of rationality and reason, and even of science itself. For what the
worldview implicit in these statements requires is the a priori exclusion of vast amounts of data simply because that information is
in conflict with that point of view. This, I believe, is a far more
irrational, and even dangerous, approach to knowledge than to allow information from every possible legitimate source to come
into our minds before applying rationality and reason in assessing
this information once we have "let it in." To exclude data because
it does not fit a particular view of reality can only, in the end, arrest the progress of science and keep us ignorant.
The worldview that Gleick, Gifford, and Miles espouse is what
is usually called the "materialist paradigm." According to this
view, which until recently has dominated mainstream science (although now it is increasingly being questioned, even in contemporary physics), there is only one hard rea_lity, namely that which is
observable through the sensory/empirical mode. This dualistic approach would separate cleanly the observer from the observed,
subject from object. In so doing, all of the information about other
or "unseen" realities that has become available to us through anthropology, comparative religion, parapsychology, consciousness
research, and various uses of nonordinary states inside and outside
the laboratory-to name but a few sources of data-would, of necessity, have to be excluded. This worldview and its accompanying restrictive epistemology would, in short, eliminate human
consciousness and experience as legitimate ways of knowing
about reality.
Of the many responses which were more open to my material,
Kathryn Robinson's reaction to Gleick's review (Robinson 1994)
was one of the most telling. Addressing the restrictiveness of the
worldview that Gleick's assault reflected she wrote, "scientific
discovery is not a matter of jamming data into existing categories�
it's about supporting new ones. It's about admitting how much we
don't know-in marked contrast to the hubris of a rationalist such
as Gleick, who argues that any phenomenon that's not available to
his senses must therefore be a sham. Gleick's arrogance," she
notes, "would perhaps approach respectability if there were no
mysteries left to science." Psychologist William James made the
same point a hundred years ago. "The ideal of every science,"
James wrote, "is that of a closed and completed system of
truth .... Phenomena unclassifiable within a system are therefore
paradoxical absurdities and must be held untrue (James 1896)."
As I discuss throughout this book, our knowledge of the abduction phenomenon depends, fundamentally,· upon human experience-i.e., the reports of the abductees themselves and the
recording, sifting, and evaluating of these reports by the investigator. That is, of necessity, a participatory process in which the person exploring the experiences-in this case myself-must enter
fully and empathically into the experiencer's world in order to
create the context of trust that will bring forth the relevant information. My reasons for taking these experiences seriously are discussed throughout the book, including Appendix A. They have to
do essentially with the consistency of reports conveyed with extreme intensity of feeling by sincere individuals of sound mind in
the United States and now, increasingly, from around the world,
who may themselves doubt profoundly-or would wish to
forget-the reality of what they have undergone. No plausible alternative explanation for the reports of abduction experiences,
which are sometimes corroborated by physical evidence, has been
discovered.
This book provides the most detailed accounts we have to date
from people who report abduction experiences. These reports, I
xii PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION
believe, raise profound questions about how we experience the
world around us and the very nature of that world. The information that I obtained during the several years of this investigation
has been communicated in case after case with such power and
consistency that a body of data formed which seemed to point
clearly to the experiential truth of the abduction phenomenon,
whatever its ultimate source might prove to be. The fact that what
the experiencers are describing simply cannot be possible according to our traditional scientific view would, it seems to me, more
sensibly, yes rationally, call for a change in that perspective, an
expansion of our notions of reality, rather than the "jamming" of
"data into existing categories" that some critics would have us do.
It was in the hope of serving a misunderstood population by making sense of their experiences, and, above all, of provoking my
readers to reconsider their views of the universe in which we live,
that I undertook to write this book.

PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION
An author embarking on a venture as manifestly novel as this one
must inevitably ask if some link may be found with his previous
work. For me, the connection resides in the matter of identitywho we are in the deepest and broadest sense. In retrospect, this
focus has been with me from the beginning, driving my clinical
explorations of dreams, nightmares, and adolescent suicide, my
biographical researches, as well as the studies of the nuclear arms
race and ethnonational conflict and, more recently, transpersonal
psychology, with which I have been involved. The abduction phenomenon, I have come to realize, forces us, if we permit ourselves
to take it seriously, to reexamine our perception of human
identity-to look at who we are from a cosmic perspective.
This book is not simply about UFOs or even alien abduction
experiences. It is about how this phenomenon, both traumatic and
transformative, can expand our sense of ourselves and our understanding of reality, and awaken our muted potential as explorers
of a universe rich in mystery, meaning, and intelligence.
When we explore phenomena that exist at the margins of accepted reality, old words become imprecise or must be given new
meanings. Terms like "abduction," "alien," "happening," and
even "reality" itself, need redefinition lest subtle distinctions be
lost. In this context, thinking of memory too" literally as "true" or
"false" may restrict what we can learn about human consciousness from the abduction experiences I recount in the pages that
follow.

CHAPTER ONE. UFO ABDUCTIONS: AN INTRODUCTION

Nothing in my nearly forty years in the field of psychiatry prepared me for what I have encountered in working with individuals
reporting abduction experiences. I have always felt that my strong
suit during many years of training in adult and child psychiatry
and psychoanalysis, and in the clinical work as a teacher and practitioner that followed, has been the discrimination of mental states,
the assessment of the nature and meaning of patients' communications. Yet here were individuals, reporting with appropriate feeling and self-doubt, experiences which-according to generally
accepted notions of reality-simply could not be. This book is a
documentation of my investigation of "abductees," or "experiencers" as they are sometimes called. When the term "abductee" appears, I am not presuming the physical reality of the person's
experience. Rather, I am following a conventional usage which I
do not feel ready to abandon until more useful language is available.
I was introduced to the abduction phenomenon in January 1990
by Budd Hopkins, a New York artist who had worked with
abductees for more than a decade. What struck me initially about
the cases I saw with Hopkins, and then on my own, was the consistency of the stories told by individuals who had not been in
communication with each other, had come forth reluctantly, and
feared the discrediting of their accounts or outright ridicule that
they had encountered in the past. Furthermore, most of the specific information that the abductees provided about the means of
transport to and from spaceships, the descriptions of the insides of
the ships themselves, and the procedures carried out by the aliens
during the reported abductions had not been written about or
shown in the media. Finally, none of the experiencers seemed psychiatrically disturbed except in a secondary sense, that is they
were troubled as a consequence of something that had apparently
happened to them. There was little to suggest that their stories
were delusional, a misinterpretation of dreams, or the product of
fantasy. None of those I saw initially and in the coming months
seemed like people who would concoct a strange story for some
personal gain or purpose. In short, the experiences reported had
the characteristics of real events: highly detailed narratives that
seemed to have no obvious symbolic pattern; intense emotional
and physical traumatic impact sometimes leaving small lesions on
the experiencers' bodies; and consistency of stories down to the
most minute details. But if these experiences were in some sense
"real," then all sorts of new questions opened up. How often was
this occurring? If there were large numbers of these cases, who
was helping these individuals deal with their experiences and what
sort of support or treatment was called for? What was the response of the mental health profession? And, most basic of all,
what was the source of these encounters? These and many other
questions will be addressed in this book.
In the more than three and a half years I have been working
with abductees through the end of 1992, I have seen more than a
hundred individuals referred for evaluation of abductions or other
"anomalous" experiences. Of these, seventy-six (ranging in age
from two to fifty-seven; forty-seven females and twenty-nine
males, including three boys eight and under) fulfill my quite strict
criteria for an abduction case: conscious reports or reports with
the help of hypnosis, of being taken by alien beings into a strange
craft, recounted with emotion appropriate to the experience being
described and no apparent mental condition that could account for
the story. I have done between one and eight several-hour modified hypnosis, or relaxation, sessions with forty-nine of these individuals, and have evolved a therapeutic approach I will describe
shortly.
Although I have a great debt and profound respect for the pioneers in this field, like Budd Hopkins, who have had the courage
to investigate and report information that runs in the face of our
culture's consensus reality, this book is based largely on my own
clinical experience. For this is a subject which is so controversial
that virtually no accepted scientific authority has evolved that I
might use to bolster my arguments or conclusions. I will report,
therefore, what I have learned primarily from my own cases and
will make interpretations and draw conclusions on the basis of
this information.
The intensity of the energies and emotions involved as
abductees relive their experiences is unlike anything I have encountered in other clinical work. The immediacy of presence, support, and understanding that is required has influenced the way I
regard the psychotherapeutic task in general. Furthermore, I have
come to see that the abduction phenomenon has important philosophical, spiritual, and social implications. Above all, more than
any other research I have undertaken, this work has led me to
challenge the prevailing worldview or consensus reality which I
had grown up believing and had always applied in my clinical/
scientific endeavors.
There are, of course, other phenomena that have led to the challenging of the prevailing materialist/dualistic worldview. These include near-death experiences, meditation practices, the use of
psychedelic substances, shamanic journeys, ecstatic dancing, religious rituals, and other practices that open our being to what we
call in the West non-ordinary states of consciousness. But none of
these, I believe, speaks to us so powerfully in the language that
we know best, the language of the physical world. For the abduction phenomenon reaches us, so to speak, where we live. It enters
harshly into the physical world, whether or not it is of this world.
Its power, therefore, to reach and alter our consciousness is potentially immense. All of these matters will be discussed more fully
in the clinical case examples that constitute the bulk of this book,
and, especially, in the concluding chapter.
One of the important questions in abduction research has been
whether the phenomenon is fundamentally new-related to the
sightings of "flying saucers" and other unidentified flying objects
(UFOs) in the 1940s and the discovery in the 1960s that these
craft had "occupants" - or is but a modern chapter in a long story
of humankind's relationship to vehicles and creatures appearing
from the heavens that goes back to antiquity. Many have also
speculated that, given the deeply technological nature of these reports, it may be a distinctly modern, Western phenomenon that is
unknown to native cultures. These questions will be addressed in
Appendix B.

WHO ARE THE ABDUCTEES?
None of the efforts to characterize abductees as a group have been
successful. They seem to come, as if at random, from all parts
of society (Bullard 1987; Hopkins 198 1, 1987; Jacobs 1992,
pp. 327-28). My own sample includes students, homemakers, secretaries, writers, business
people, computer industry professionals,
musicians, psychologists, a nightclub receptionist, a prison guard,
an acupuncturist, a social worker, and a gas station attendant. At
first I thought that working class people predominated, but that
appears to be an artifact related to the fact that those with less of
an economic and social stake in the society seem less reluctant to
come forward. Conversely, more professionally and politically
prominent abductees fear the humiliation, rejection, and threat to
their position that public revelation of their experiences might
bring. One of the men with whom I have worked left me a note
with a telephone number and a post office box in a town in which
he did not live. He did not tell me his real name until some trust
had been established between us. A highly renowned political figure who is well known in UFO circles to be an abduction witness
has applied the skills of his profession to the fullest to avoid
public identification and embarrassment (Hopkins 1992).
Efforts to establish a pattern of psychopathology other than disturbances associated with a traumatic event have been unsuccessful. Psychological testing of abductees has not revealed evidence
of mental or emotional disturbance that could account for their reported experiences (Bloecher, Clamar, and Hopkins 1985; Parnell
1986; Parnell and Sprinkle 1990; Rodeghier, Goodpaster, and
Blatterbauer 1991; Slater 1985; Spanos et al. 1993; Stone-Carmen
1995). My own sample demonstrates a broad range of mental
health and emotional adaptation. Some experiencers are highly
functioning individuals who seem mainly to need support in integrating their abduction experiences with the rest of their lives.
Others verge on being overwhelmed by the traumatic impact and
philosophical implications of their experiences and need a great
deal of counseling and emotional support.
The administration of a full battery of psychometric tests is
time-consuming and expensive. I have undertaken to have four of
my cases tested by Ph.D. psychologists. One twenty-one-year-old
man, who I knew was quite troubled--one of two of my seventy six cases who had to be hospitalized for psychiatric reasons revealed a complex picture of emotional disturbance and troubled
thinking in which cause and effect in relation to the abduction 
experiences could not be sorted out. The other three tested in the
normal range with no obvious psychopathology found.
The effort to discover a personality type associated with 
abductions has also not been successful (Basterfield and Bartholomew
1988; Basterfield 1995; Mack 1995; Rodeghier, Goodpaster, and
Blatterbauer 1991). Psychologist Kenneth Ring has posited the
notion of an encounter-prone personality (Ring 1992; Ring and
Rosing 1990), a tendency of an individual who has been affected
by unusual experiences to be more open to them in the future. But
in this, as in any hypothesis concerning the personalities of
abductees, it is important to keep in mind that the encounters may
in many instances be found to have begun in early infancy, and
children as young as two years old have talked of their abduction
experiences. I have two boys under three in my own sample.
Cause and effect in the relationship of abduction experiences to
building of personality are thus virtually impossible to sort out.
Similarly, there is no obvious pattern of family structure and 
interaction in the case of abductees. When I began this work I was
struck by how many abductees came from broken homes or had
one or more alcoholic parents. But some of my cases come from
intact, well-functioning families. There also seems to be a "poor
fit" between some individual experiencers and their parents, and a
number of my cases complain about coldness and emotional deprivation 
within the family (for example, Joe, chapter 8). Some
abductees experience having been told by an alien female that she
was their true mother, and they even feel in some vague but deep
way that this is actually true, i.e., that they are not "from here"
and that their human mother and father are not their true parents.
I have several cases in which the abduction-affected sibling seems
to have fared better in life than the other siblings and attributes
this to the warmth and love received during their life from the
aliens themselves. It appears, as in the case of sexual abuse (see
below), that the abductees experience that the alien beings seem
interested in human woundedness and may play some sort of
healing or restorative role. Careful research to document this possibility is needed.
I have the impression that abductees as a group are usually
open and intuitive individuals, less tolerant than usual of societal
authoritarianism, and more flexible in accepting diversity and the
unusual experiences of other people. Some of my cases report a
variety of psychic experiences, which has been noted by other researchers 
(Basterfield 1995). But here too, biases related to the effects 
of their abduction experiences, the particular segment of the
abductee population that came to me in the first place, and the results, in some instances, of our work together must be considered.
Subtle measures, such as tests of openness, intuition, and psychic
ability, that might distinguish abductees as a group from a
matched sample of nonexperiencers, have yet to be developed or
applied in the field of abduction research.
An association with sexual abuse has also been suggested in the
abduction literature (Laibow 1989; Ring and Rosing 1990). But
here too errors related to the misremembering of traumatic experiences, 
or the reverse-traumatic experiences of one kind (abduction) 
opening the psyche to the recollection of traumas of another
kind (sexual abuse)-can lead to falsely overstressing the association. 
I have worked with one woman, for example, who went to
a capable psychotherapist for presumed sexual abuse and incest-related 
problems. Several hypnosis sessions failed to reveal evidence 
of such events. But during one of her sessions she recalled
a UFO that landed near her home when she was a six-year-old
girl from which emerged typical alien beings who took her aboard
the craft. For the first time, she experienced powerful emotions,
especially fear, in the therapy hour. The therapist who referred the
woman to me told me that he was "clean," i.e., was not directly
familiar with the abduction phenomenon and did not suspect that
she had such a history. There is not a single abduction case in my
experience or that of other investigators (for example, Jacobs
1992, p. 285) that has turned out to have masked a history of 
sexual abuse or any other traumatic cause. But the reverse 
has frequently occurred-that an abduction history has been revealed in
cases investigated for sexual or other traumatic abuse.
Sexual abuse appears to be one of the forms of human
woundedness that, from the experiencer's standpoint, has led the
aliens to intervene in a protective or healing manner. A thirty-five 
year-old woman, for example, remembered consciously being sexually 
abused by her father at age four and weeping in the cellar
afterwards. Several familiar alien beings-she recalled encounters
from fourteen months old-"checked me to see if I was hurt,
'cause I did hurt," found underwear for her (not the "right ones")
and "did up my sandals," she told me.
There have also been efforts to relate the abduction phenomenon 
to Satanic ritual abuse (Dean 1995; Wright 1993) and multiple 
personality disorders which, like sexual abuse, are related to
psychological traumas in which the mechanism of dissociation is
employed (Frankel 1993; Ganaway 1989; Spiegel and Cardena
1991 ). But it is important to realize that dissociation is a means
whereby the personality copes with a traumatic experience by
splitting off part of itself to keep disturbing emotions out of 
consciousness, thus allowing the rest of the psyche to function as well
as it can. "Dissociation" per se tells us nothing about the source
or content of the original disturbing experience. Abductees will
use dissociation as a way of dealing with their threatening experiences, 
i.e., to keep them out of consciousness, and it may even
be a prevalent coping device among abductees (Jacobson 1995).
But the fact that they employ this defense mechanism does not tell
us anything about the nature of the original traumatic experience.
I feel sometimes that in the mental health profession we are like
the generals who are accused of always fighting the last war, 
invoking the diagnoses and mental mechanisms with which we are
familiar when confronted with a new and mysterious phenomenon, 
especially if it is one that challenges our way of thinking.
The first cases that were referred to me in the spring of 1990
confirmed what Hopkins, David Jacobs, Leo Sprinkle, John Carpenter, 
and other pioneers who were investigating the abduction
phenomenon had already discovered. These individuals reported
being taken against their wills by alien beings, sometimes through
the walls of their houses, and subjected to elaborate intrusive procedures 
which appeared to have a reproductive purpose. In a few
cases they were actually observed by independent witnesses to be
physically absent during the time of the abduction. These people
suffered from no obvious psychiatric disorder, except the effects
of traumatic experience, and were reporting with powerful emotion 
what to them were utterly real experiences. Furthermore,
these experiences were sometimes associated with UFO sightings
by friends, family members, or others in the community, including
media reporters and journalists, and frequently left physical traces
on the individuals' bodies, such as cuts and small ulcers that
would tend to heal rapidly and followed no apparent psychodynamically 
identifiable pattern as do, for example, religious stigmata. In short, 
I was dealing with a phenomenon that I felt could
not be explained psychiatrically, yet was simply not possible
within the framework of the Western scientific worldview.

WORKING WITH EXPERIENCERS
With this dilemma in mind I approached Thomas Kuhn, author of
the 1962 classic The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which analyzes 
how scientific paradigms change, to get his advice about
my investigations. I knew Tom Kuhn since childhood, for his parents 
and mine were friends in New York and I often attended eggnog parties 
at Christmastime in the Kuhns' home. I found the advice that he and his wife, 
Jehane, who is highly knowledgeable in
the fields of mythology and folklore, gave me to be very useful.
What I found most helpful was Kuhn's observation that the Westem scientific paradigm 
had come to assume the rigidity of a theology, and that this belief system was held in place by the
structures, categories, and polarities of language, such as real/
unreal, exists/does not exist, objective/subjective, intrapsychic/
external world, and happened/did not happen. He suggested that
in pursuing my investigations I suspend to the degree that I was
able all of these language forms and simply collect raw information, 
putting aside whether or not what I was learning fit any 
particular worldview. Later I would see what I had found and
whether any coherent theoretical formulation would be possible.
This, by and large, has been the approach that I have tried to follow.
When a possible abductee comes to see me, either referred
through the UFO network, by another mental health professional,
or self-referred upon learning of my work through the media, I
explain that I regard him or her as a co-investigator. Although
abductees understand that I am engaged in research about the phenomenon, 
I explain that my first responsibility is to their health
and well-being. The overall investigative and therapeutic approach
I use has evolved over the past three and a half years and is still
changing (Mack 1992). I do an initial screening interview, which
generally lasts about one and a half to two hours. During this session 
I obtain a history of possible abduction-related phenomena
and learn as much about the person and his or her family as I can.
Sometimes additional family members, who may or may not be
experiencers themselves, will be interviewed.
Abductees may have a great deal of conscious recall of their
experiences without hypnosis. One nineteen-year-old man remembered the details of an abduction at age four in our first interview.
He told anxiously of being "picked up" from a clearing behind his
home by gray aliens at midday, and taken into a spaceship. He
was able to describe the saucer like UFO and the beings themselves in great detail. On the ship he was unable to move and was
forced to lie down in a cubicle where he was bathed in laserlike
light and a skin sample was taken with a cylindrical instrument.
After this he was returned and told to "run along now" down a
path to the apartment complex where he was living.
But often abductees say that there are vast areas of their lives
that they strongly feel are outside of conscious recall and yet 
powerfully affect them on a day-to-day basis. Although they generally
know that these experiences may have been traumatic and that
recollecting them will be disturbing, the majority of abductees I
have seen elect to investigate their experiences further. It is far
more difficult, they have felt, to have major episodes of their
mental lives and experiences unavailable to them than it is to
confront what they sense has happened, however disturbing the
events may prove to be.

The inducement of a nonordinary state, using even the simplest
of relaxation techniques, seems to be highly effective in bringing
abductees' walled off experiences into consciousness and in discharging 
their traumatic impact. I do not understand why this is so
dramatically true. Most of the abductees I have worked with seem
to move readily into a non-ordinary state of consciousness, although 
previous studies have shown that they are no more hypnotizable 
than the norm (Spanos et al. 1993; Rodeghier, Goodpaster,
and Blatterbauer 1991 ). It is as if the changed state of consciousness, 
in a kind of reverse mirror-imaging of the original altering
of the psyche's consciousness, undoes the forces of repression that
were imposed at the time of the abduction experience.
These repressing forces are felt by the abductees to be much
more than their own self-protective defenses. They may feel that
as much as ninety percent of the energy that kept them from remembering was the result of an outside turning or switching off
of memory by something the aliens themselves do. According to
the abductees, the aliens will frequently communicate to them that
they will not, or should not, remember what has occurred. Sometimes it is explained that this is for their own protection, and indeed, especially as in the case of small children, ongoing
conscious recall of painful or traumatic experiences could interfere
with daily life (for example, Jerry, chapter 6). The experiencers
may feel that they are specifically disobeying the admonitions of
the alien beings, with whom they often feel connected or allied on
a very deep level, when they cooperate with me in recalling their
abductions. This requires reassurance on my part that no harm, to
my knowledge, has ever come from recalling these experiences
when done in an appropriately supportive context.
While the accounts often begin as deeply traumatic, in the end
the experiencer often reports a profound connection with the beings. It has been suggested that this alliance with the alien beings
is a manifestation of the "Stockholm syndrome," or identification
with the perpetrator, whereby victims sympathize with the aggressor 
in order to maintain a sense of agency in a helpless situation.
While this remains a valid hypothesis, in my experience, and in
the following case materials, abductees seem to come to feel a
more authentic identification with the purpose of the whole phenomenon.
The economy and history of remembering in the abduction phenomenon is one of its most interesting aspects. Detailed recall of
experiences that were never in conscious awareness may be triggered years, even several decades, after the event by something
seen or heard which may bear only a minimal relationship to the
actual abduction. What combination of abductee/alien factors determines the timing of recall, including when the experiencers
elect to investigate their histories and who comes to tell their stories, remains to be understood further.
In my work with experiencers, I encourage them in a safe and
quiet setting to maintain a focus on the breath as a tool for 
centering and integration. I have found it invaluable in working with
abductees. This is related to the extraordinary intensity 
of the energies involved-connected apparently with the power of the original 
experience-manifested in bodily sensations and movements
and strong emotions, especially terror, rage, and sadness, that
come up as the abduction material emerges.
After a simple induction that includes soothing imagery, 
a systematic relaxation of the parts of the body, 
and frequent return of attention to the breath, 
I encourage the experiencer to envision a
comforting and relaxing place, to which the experiencer 
may automatically return at any time during the session. This enables the
individual to mediate the pace of accessing the material, 
and reinforces the priority I place on his or her well-being.
As is often true of survivors of other traumatic events who seek
to bring the events into full consciousness, abductees want 
to remember. Sometimes there is a danger that the unfolding of the rnarrative, 
the recall of apparent abduction events, will run aheag of the abductees' 
defenses once again, resulting in their becoming overwhelmed and 
traumatized. Through focusing on the breath during the induction process 
and the relaxation session itself the experiencer is able to be grounded 
and to approach these experiences with greater strength. I explain to the abductee 
at the beginning of the session that I am more interested in the integration 
of the recalled experiences as we go along than in "getting the story." 
The story, I explain, will take care of itself in due time.
Having achieved together a relaxed (if often somewhat apprehensive) state of being and established skills for pacing and
grounding the recall, we proceed to the process of further exploration of the abduction experience Numerous examples of this
part of the session are detailed in the following chapters. It is useful in reading these accounts to note the way in which a return to
focus on the breath in difficult moments often reduces fear by
grounding the experience in raw perception and quieting the interpretive mind. In addition, at moments of special distress during
the session, I may place my hand gently on the abductee's shoulder to assure him or her of my presence. But in providing this reassurance one must be careful not to create a confusing replication
of the original intrusion, which any physical contact with an experiencer who is in the depths of traumatic recall may create.
At the end of the session the experiencer may feel powerful
tension or cramping in certain muscle groups, especially for some
reason in the hands; and a tension-exaggerating approach, 
as developed by the Grofs, may be useful in discharging the remaining
tightness or cramping. We also spend some time at this point 
discussing the material that has emerged. This conversation helps to
bring the material more fully into normal consciousness and to
further the process of integration. It is at this time that many experiencers 
begin to struggle deeply with questions of accuracy and
meaning, and they often ask me how they should regard their hypnotically recovered material.
Questions related to the reliability of memory in hypnosis, the
accuracy of incomplete or previously repressed memory, the potential biasing 
influence of the investigator, and the role of physical versus 
psychological evidence in assessing the reality of the
abduction phenomenon will be examined in Appendix A.
Epistemological questions, especially those concerning
consciousness as an instrument of knowing, will be with us
throughout this book. In this work, as in any clinically sound investigation, the psyche of the investigator, or, more accurately,
the interaction of the psyches of the client and the clinician, is
the means of gaining knowledge. But it must then be noted that
although we analyze and formulate as objectively as possible afterwards, the original information was obtained nondualistically,
i.e., through the intersubjective unfolding of the investigatorabductee interaction. Thus experience, the reporting of that experience, and the receiving of that experience through the psyche of
the investigator are, in the absence of physical verification sufficiently robust to satisfy scientific requirements of proof (there is
physical evidence but not proof), the only ways that we can
know about abductions.
When experiencers ask me about the status of their experience
in the non-ordinary state, I can only say that the elements of their
story have appeared again and again in the stories of other individuals who are not mentally disturbed. I note that the feelings
and emotions they have shown me seem quite real to me, and I
explore other possible explanations for feelings that intense. Finally, I tell them that I have no answers, and that we are investigating their experiences together.
At the end of the session I instruct the experiencers to call
either me or my assistant, Pam Kasey, who is present during almost all the meetings, for a follow-up discussion. They usually do
call, but if they do not we call them. We are interested in how the
experiencer has dealt with the powerful feelings that came up during the session, additional memories that surfaced, and how they
are managing what I call the "ontological shock" of the abduction
events; for until the powerful reliving that has occurred during the
hypnosis session, the abductees may have still clung to the possibility that these experiences are dreams or some sort of curable
mental disorder. The denial never disappears altogether, and a jshock may recur, even after several hypnosis sessions, especially
if a second abductee reports independently witnessing or experiencing during a shared abduction precisely what the first one has
reported.
Regular support group meetings, held in a friendly, private atmosphere where easy socializing is possible, are an important aspect of my work with abductees; for members of this population
feel extremely isolated and unable to communicate, except with
other experiencers, a central aspect of their lives without fear of rejection or outright ridicule. In the support group they find a community of individuals with similar experiences. In the group abductees can share what they have been through, or are still experiencing, can keep up with what is going on in the UFO/ abduction field generally, and can explore the various possible meanings and implications of the experiences in their individual and collective lives.
Although one or more professional investigators are present during the support group, it is important that the abductees develop a self-help support network among themselves outside of the regular meeting times. Sometimes this involves small group
meetings; at other times telephone contact is sufficient. As I have stressed, abductees are not, generally, mentally disturbed individuals. But they have undergone powerfully traumatic or confusing
experiences, feel isolated from the mainstream belief structures of
the society, and often need a great deal of support from people
who know about or are familiar with the abduction phenomenon.
It is often useful for an abductee to have an ongoing relationship with a psychotherapist who is familiar with this phenomenon.
When I began my work there were very few mental health professionals who involved themselves with this field, and some were
doing potential harm by trying to fit the experiencers into a familiar diagnostic category, most often of some other form of traumatic abuse. But that is changing, and in the Boston area and
some other metropolitan centers there are increasing numbers of
clinicians who are open to the reality of the abduction phenomenon and able to work with this population, although few are prepared to take on the powerful reliving of the abductees'
experiences through hypnosis. Training programs, begun in 1992
with the leadership and support of Las Vegas businessman Robert
Bigelow, and organized in various American cities by abduction
investigators John Carpenter, Budd Hopkins, and David Jacobs,
are familiarizing many mental health professionals with the abduction phenomenon.
In talking with people who work with experiencers, I have
come to believe that what is most important during a regression
and in all interactions with experiencers is the way of holding the
energies of these experiences. This includes a degree of warmth
and empathy, a belief in the ability of the individual to integrate/
these confusing experiences and make meaning of them for him or herself, and a willingness to enter into the co-investigative
process and risk being changed by the information. These are, of
course, qualities that are important in any relationship, and they
become critical in this work, where we are all pushed to our edge,
experiencer, investigator, and therapist alike.

====================================================================
CHAPTER TWO. ALIEN ABDUCTIONS: AN OVERVIEW

INDICATORS OF ABDUCTION EXPERIENCES
Although some abductees may recall only a single dramatic instance, when a case is carefully investigated it generally turns out
that experiencers begin to recall encounters that have been occurring from early childhood and even infancy. Indications of childhood abductions include the memory of a "presence," or "little
men," or other small beings in the bedroom; recollections of unexplained intense light in the bedroom or other rooms; a humming
or vibratory sensation at the onset of the experience; instances of
being floated down the hall or out of the house; close-up sightings
of UFOs; vivid dreams of being taken into a strange room or enclosure where intrusive procedures were done; and time lapses of
an hour or more (Hopkins 198 1) in which the parents may have
been unable to find the child. Awakening paralyzed, with a sense
of dread, and experiencing strange beings or a presence in the
room, are common indicators in both children and adults.
Sometimes the alien beings are remembered as friendly playmates, or even healers (in the case of Carlos, for example, the
abductee felt he was literally cured of life threatening bouts of
pneumonia by the alien beings). Often, the abductees feel that the
aliens are protectors in early childhood, but the encounters become more serious and disturbing as the child approaches puberty. But even small children (as in the case of Colin, Jerry's son,
whose history is in chapter 6) may be terrified by the experience
of being taken from their family up into the sky against their will
and subjected to painful procedures. Frequently the child will tell
the parents of these encounters, which the child knows to be real,
and are told by the parents that they were dreaming. They learn
eventually to go "underground," and often resolve to tell no one
until, as adults, they finally decide to investigate their experiences.
Abduction experiences run in families, sometimes over three
or more generations (Howe 1989). Here too the vagaries of memory-the peculiar mix of psychological defenses and an apparent control of recall by forces that the aliens command-make it
difficult to develop meaningful statistics regarding the number or
percentage of relatives involved. In the cases of Jerry and Arthur
(chapters 6 and 15), for example, the experiencers contacted me
after a conversation with an affected sibling triggered their memory. Parents who may eventually acknowledge close-up UFO
sightings, or even actual abduction experiences, often initially
deny their own experiences and even their children's, not wanting
to be reminded of their own abduction traumas. Sometimes children will report seeing a parent on the ship, but when the child
confronts the parent with that experience the parent may not recall
being abducted. Or the reverse may occur-a parent, as in Joe and
Jerry's cases, or an older sibling, may recall being abducted with
a child or a younger sibling, and feel deeply troubled at being unable to protect the child. Or, conversely, a child may resent an
older sibling or parent, who may or may not recall the abduction,
for not protecting him or her.
Although abduction or abduction-related experiences may recur
throughout the experiencer's life, the pattern and timing of these
encounters is not clear. Some abductees believe that they occur at
times of stress or particular openness or vulnerability. But this is
by no means certain. One of the most distressing aspects of the
phenomenon to investigators and experiencers alike, although for
different reasons, is the unpredictability of its recurrence.
There are other symptoms that are tied to unconscious association with particular elements of the abduction experiences. These
may indicate a possible abduction history, but are not by themselves definitive. They include a general sense of vulnerability, especially at night; fear of hospitals (related to the intrusive
procedures on the ships) ; fear of flying, elevators, animals, insects, and sexual contact. Particular sounds, smells, images, or activities that are disturbing for no apparent reason may later prove
to be connected with the abduction experience. Insomnia, fear of
the dark and of being alone at night, the covering of windows
against intruders, sleeping with the light on (as an adult), and disturbing 
dreams and nightmares of being in strange flying craft or
enclosures, are common among abductees.
Odd rashes, cuts, scoop marks, or other lesions may appear
overnight, or unexplained bleeding may occur from the nose, ear,
or rectum, which by itself might not draw attention, but attains
significance in association with other abduction-related phenomena. Other symptoms, which later prove to be specifically related
to aspects of the abduction experience, include sinus pain;
urological-gynecological complaints, including unexplained difficulty during pregnancy; and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.
For a clinician like myself, trained in the Western tradition, the
investigation of abduction cases presents special challenges, since
much of the information that is obtained does not fit within accepted notions of reality. The temptation is to accept some experiences, especially those that appear to make some sort of sense
within our space/time paradigm, and reject others as too "far out,"
i.e., too far from what we know as possible from a physical standpoint. I suspect such discriminations are not wise or useful. For
the whole phenomenon is so bizarre from a Western ontological
standpoint that to credit some experiences because they appear, at
least superficially, familiar to us and reject others on the grounds
of their strangeness seems quite illogical. Furthermore, this would
prematurely limit the scope of study of a phenomenon about .which we know so little. My criterion, therefore, for including or 1taking seriously an observation by an abductee is whether what 'has been reported was felt to be real by the experiencer and was
communicated sincerely and with powerful affect appropriate to
what is being reported. This does not mean that I have concluded 1that what the experiencer reports happened literally in our physical world.

THREE CLASSES OF INFORMATION
Applying the above framework I have found it useful to distin- ;guish three classes or levels of information. First comes what l1might be called the apparently literal, physical level. This con- rcerns phenomena such as the visual sighting or radar spotting of ��UFOs, light and sound phenomena associated with them, the Iburned patches of earth that they sometimes leave, aborted preg- anancies, and lesions on the surface of or implants left in ­abductees' bodies following their experiences. These are phenom- Jena that appear to occur within the physical universe familiar to
Western science and can be studied by its empirical methods. The
field of ufology-the sighting of UFOs-was concerned primarily
with directly observable phenomena until the discovery of the abduction syndrome.
Second are phenomena which look like they could be understood within our space/time universe if only we had the scientific
and technological knowledge and ability to do so. These could be
"extraterrestrial" phenomena which suggest technologies thousands of years ahead of us. These phenomena are, at least theoretically, not inconsistent with some sort of extension of the physical
laws set forth by Western science. This category would include
how the spacecraft get here (the "propulsion systems"); how they
can accelerate at unbelievable speeds, virtually flicking across the
sky or disappearing suddenly from a radar screen; the means by
which the alien beings "float" people through doors, windows,
and walls; the switching off of memory and consciousness of
abductees and potential witnesses and other forms of mind control; the creation of alien/human hybrid fetuses, seen by or
brought to the abductees on the ships; and the creation or staging
of powerfully vivid images of landscapes, experienced by the
abductee as real (for example, Catherine, chapter 7). Although we
do not understand the mechanisms by which these effects are
achieved, they do not, per se, require a fundamental change of
paradigm. Spectacular advances in physics, biology, neuroscience,
and psychology might, conceivably, shed light on them.
Finally, there are phenomena and experiences reported by
abductees for which we can conceive of no explanation within a
Newtonian/Cartesian or even Einsteinian space/time ontology.
These include the apparent mastery of thought travel by the aliens
and sometimes by the abductees themselves (as Paul describes in
chapter 1 0); abductees' sense that their experiences are not occurring in our space/time universe, or that space and time have "collapsed"; a consciousness abductees experience of vast other
realities beyond the screen of this one, beyond the "veil" (a word
they frequently use) ; the deeply felt sense of opening up to or returning to the source of being and creation or cosmic consciousness, experienced by abductees as an inexpressibly divine light or
"Home" (another word they commonly use) ; the experience by
abductees of a dual human/alien identity, i.e., that they are themselves of alien origins (for example, Peter, Joe, and Paul, in chapters 13, 8, and 10); and the powerful reliving of past life
experiences, including great cycles of birth and death. In addition,
the aliens appear to be consummate shape-shifters, often appearing initially to the abductees as animals--owls, eagles, raccoons,and deer are among the creatures the abductees have seen
initially-while the ships themselves may be disguised as helicopters or, as in the case of one of my clients, as a too-tall kangaroo
that appeared in a park when the abductee was seven. The connection with animal spirits is very powerful for many abductees
(for example, Carlos and Dave, chapters 14 and 12). This shamanic dimension needs further study. These phenomena cannot be
understood within the framework of the laws of Western science,
although as I have indicated, they are fully consistent with the beliefs developed thousands of years ago by other non-Western cultures.

PHENOMENOLOGY: WHAT DO EXPERIENCERS TELL US?
The summary of abduction phenomenology provided in what follows will be developed in more detail in the case examples.
How Do AsoucTION ExPERIENCES BEGIN?
Abduction encounters begin most commonly in homes or when
abductees are driving automobiles. In some cases the experiencer
may be walking in nature. One woman reported being taken from
a snowmobile on a winter's day. Children have experienced being ,taken from school yards. The first indication that an abduction is
about to occur might be an unexplained intense blue or white light
that floods the bedroom, an odd buzzing or humming sound, unexplained apprehension, the sense of an unusual presence or even
the direct sighting of one or more humanoid beings in the room,
and, of course, the close-up sighting of a strange craft.
When an abduction begins during the night, or, as is common,
during the early hours of the morning, the experiencer may at first
call what is happening a dream. But careful questioning will
reveal that the experiencer had not fallen asleep at all, or that the
experience began in a conscious state after awakening. As the abduction begins the abductee may experience a subtle shift of consciousness, but this state of being is just as real, or even more so,
than the "normal" one. Sometimes there is a moment of shock
and sadness when the abductee discovers in the initial interview,
or during a hypnosis session, that what they had more comfortably held to be a dream was actually some sort of bizarre, threatening, and viv-id experience which they may then recall has
occurred repeatedly and for which they have no explanation.
After the initial contact, the abductee is commonly "floated"
(the word most commonly used) down the hall, through the wall
or windows of the house, or through the roof of the car. They are
usually astounded to discover that they are passed through solid ­
objects, experiencing only a slight vibratory sensation. In most
cases the beam of light seems to serve as an energy source or
"ramp" for transporting the abductee from the place where the abduction starts to a waiting vehicle. Usually the experiencer is accompanied by one, two, or more humanoid beings who guide
them to the ship. At some point early in this process the experiencer discovers that he or she has been numbed or totally paralyzed by a touch of the hand or an instrument held by one of the
beings. Abductees may still be able to move their heads, and usually can see what is going on, although frequently they will close
their eyes so they can deny or avoid experiencing the reality of
what is occurring. The terror associated with this helplessness
blends with the frightening nature of the whole strange experience.
When abductions begin in the bedroom, the experiencer may
not initially see the spacecraft, which is the source of the light and
is outside the house. The UFOs vary in size from a few feet
across to several hundred yards wide. They are described as silvery or metallic and cigar-, saucer-, or dome-shaped. Strong
white, blue, orange, or red light emanates from the bottom of the
craft, which is apparently related to the propulsion energy, and
also from porthole-like openings that ring its outer edge. After
they are taken from the house, abductees commonly see a small
spacecraft which may be standing on long legs. They are initially
taken into this craft, which then rises to a second larger or
"mother" ship. At other times they experience being taken up
through the night sky directly to the large ship and will see the
house or ground below receding dramatically. Often the abductee
will struggle at this and later points to stop the experience, but
this does little good except to give the individual a vital sense that
he or she is not simply a passive victim. There is a debate in abduction work as to whether abductions can be stopped, or even
whether to do so is a good idea (Druffel 1995). There are small
variations in what is experienced during this phase of the abduction. Arthur (chapter 1 5), for example, described ascending to a .
UFO on a kind of threadlike arc that extended to the craft from
the car his mother had been driving when the abduction began.INDEPENDENT WITNESSING
Independent witnessing of an abduction does occur, but is, in my
experience, relatively rare and limited in nature. As in so many
aspects of the phenqmenon, the evidence may be compelling, yet
at the same time maddeningly subtle and difficult to corroborate
with as much supporting data as finn proof would require. Husbands and wives, for example, are commonly "switched off'
while the spouse is being abducted and have "slept" through the
whole event. The abductee is sometimes highly frustrated when
loud screaming fails to rouse the sleeping partner, who may seem
to be in a state of unconsciousness deeper than sleep, appearing as
if dead.
Hopkins has documented a case, now being widely discussed,
where a woman made an unsolicited report to him that from the
Brooklyn Bridge she saw his client, Linda Cortile, being taken by
alien beings from her twelfth story East River apartment into a
waiting spacecraft that then plunged into the river below (Hopkins
1992, 1995). These observations corresponded precisely with what
Mrs. Cortile had told Hopkins happened to her when he recovered
information about a reported abduction that occurred in November
1989. This is, to my knowledge, the only documented case where
an individual, who was not him- or herself abducted, reported witnessing an abduction as it was actually taking place. The witnesses of an abduction, it seems, are often themselves abductees,
who may be involved in the same event, raising questions about
the "objectivity" of the observer. Sometimes, according to reports,
the abductee may be noted to be missing for a half hour or more
or, in rare cases, for days, as in the famous Travis Walton case
(Walton 1978; Torme 1993), by family members or others. But in
these instances no one has seen them being taken into a spacecraft, and there is no finn proof that abduction was the cause of
their absence.
One of my first cases, a young woman of twenty-four, told of
being abducted as a teenager with a friend after midnight from the
basement den of her friend's home. The girls' fathers were frantic
when they could not find their daughters during the night. According to both girls (I have spoken with the other girl, who confirms
my client's account) the fathers checked the den during the early
hours of the morning and found that the two teenagers were not
there. By six o'clock they were both back in the den. In another
case the eight-year-old daughter of one of my abductee-clients,
who has herself spoken of abduction experiences, observed her
mother to be missing from her room when she looked for her during the night. The mother told me that she had had an abduction
experience at the exact time the daughter told her she was missing. In the morning the girl said to her mother, "Daddy was there
and the covers on your side were turned down but you were
gone." Another client of mine reported an abduction with a college roommate from their dormitory. She said she actually saw her
roommate being returned through the door through which she was
taken. When the beings returned the roommate, my client observed "her head was hanging and her hair was hanging down
and· I thought that she was dead." But she herself then experienced an abduction, so that her credibility as an "independent"
witness might therefore be questionable.
Independent observation of a UFO near where an experiencer
reports that an abduction took place is another kind of corroborative evidence, especially if the abductee did not him- or herself
actually see the craft. We will see in Catherine's case (chapter 7)
that she was shocked to discover in the media the next morning
that a UFO had been observed traveling the exact route north of
Boston that she had felt compelled to drive during the night. Her
drive culminated in an abduction, which took place in a wooded
section of a suburb about fifteen miles northeast of Boston, but
Catherine never saw the UFO itself, except in the air near her car
as the abduction was actually taking place. Peter (chapter 1 3) reported being taken into a UFO from a Connecticut home while
three of his friends who were walking outside witnessed a UFO
close above the house. The case is weakened by the fact that the
three witnesses failed to check inside the house to see if he was
actually missing.

INSIDE THE SHIPS: THE BEINGS
Sometimes abductees will report being taken into the ship through
its underside or through oval portals along its edge, although often
they cannot recall the moment when they entered the craft. Once
inside they may at first find that they are in a small dark room,
a sort of vestibule. But soon they are taken into one or more
larger rooms where the various procedures will occur. These
rooms are brightly lit, with a hazy luminosity from indirect light
sources in the walls. The atmosphere may be � cool, and occasionally even foul-smelling. The walls and ceilings are curved
and usually white, although the floor may appear dark or even
black. Computer-like consoles and other equipment and instru-ments line the sides of the rooms, which may have balconies and
various levels and alcoves. None of the equipment or instruments
are quite like ones with which we are familiar (Miller 1995). Furniture is sparse, limited generally to body-conforming chairs and
tables with a single support stand that can tilt one way or another
during the procedures. The ambiance is generally sterile and cold,
mechanistic and hospital-like, except when some sort of more
complex staging occurs. Many more details of the inside of the
ships and, of course, of the abduction processes themselves, will
be provided in the case histories.
Inside the ships the abductees usually witness more alien beings, who are busy doing various tasks related to monitoring the
equipment and handling the abduction procedures. The beings described by my cases are of several sorts. They appear as tall or
short luminous entities that may be translucent, or at least not altogether solid. Reptilian creatures have been seen (Carlos, chapter 14) that seem to be carrying out mechanical functions. Nordic looking blond human-like beings are seen and human helpers are
sometimes observed working alongside the humanoid alien beings. But by far the most common entity observed are the small
"grays," humanoid beings three to four feet in height. The grays
are mainly of two kinds-smaller drone or insectlike workers,
who move or glide robotically outside and inside the ships and
perform various specific tasks, and a slightly taller leader or "doctor," as the abductees most often call hlm. Female "nurses," or
other beings with special functions, are observed. The leader is
usually felt to be male, although female leaders are also seen.
Gender difference is not determined so much anatomically as by
an intuitive feeling that abductees find difficult to put into words.
The small grays reported have large, pear-shaped heads that
protrude in the back, long arms with three or four long fingers, a
thin torso, and spindly legs. Feet are not often seen directly, and
are usually covered with single-piece boots. External genitalia,
with rare exceptions (Joe, chapter 8), are not observed. The beings
are hairless with no ears, have rudimentary nostril holes, and a
thin slit for a mouth which rarely opens or is expressive of emotion. By far the most prominent features are huge, black eyes
which curve upward and are more rounded toward the center of
the head and pointed at the outer edge. They seem to have no
whites or pupils, although occasionally the abductee may be able
to see a kind of eye inside the eye, with the outer blackness appearing as a sort of goggle. The eyes, as we will see in the case
examples, have a compelling power, and the abductees will often
wish to avoid looking directly into them because of the overwhelming dread of their own sense of self, or loss of will, that occurs when they do so. In addition to boots, the aliens usually wear
a form-fitting, single-piece, tunic like garment, which is sparsely
adorned. A kind of cowl or hood is frequently reported.
The leader or doctor is reported as slightly taller, perhaps four
and a half or five feet at most, and has features similar to the
smaller grays, except that he may seem older or more wrinkled.
He is clearly in charge of the procedures that occur on the ship.
The attitude of the abductees toward the leader is generally ambivalent. They often discover that they have known one leader being throughout their lives and have a strong bond with him,
experiencing a powerful, and even reciprocal, love relationship. At
the same time, they resent the control he has exercised in their
lives. Communication between the aliens and humans is experienced as telepathic, mind to mind or thought to thought, with no
specific common learned language being necessary.

PROCEDURES
The procedures that occur on the ships have been described in
great detail in the literature on abductions (Bullard 1987; Hopkins
1981, 1987; Jacobs 1992) and will be summarized only briefly
here, although many of them will be described in detail in the
case examples. They might be categorized as of two sorts, physical and informational.
The abductee is usually undressed and is forced naked, or wearing only a single garment such as a T-shirt, onto a body-fitting
table where most of the procedures occur. The experiencer may be
the only one undergoing the procedures during a particular abduction, or may see one, two, or many other human beings undergoing similar intrusions. The beings seem to study their captives
endlessly, staring at them extensively, often with the large eyes
close up to the humans' heads. The abductees may feel as if the
contents of their minds have been totally known, even, in a sense,
taken over. Skin and hair, and other samples from inside the body,
are taken with the use of various instruments that the abductees
can sometimes describe in great detail.
Instruments are used to penetrate virtually every part of the
abductees' bodies, including the nose, sinuses, eyes, ears, and
other parts of the head, arms, legs, feet, abdomen, genitalia, and,
more rarely, the chest. Extensive surgical-like procedures done inside the head have been described, which abductees feel may alter
their nervous systems. The most common, and evidently most important procedures, involve the reproductive system. Instruments
that penetrate the abdomen or involve the genital organs themselves are used to take sperm samples from men and to remove or
fertilize eggs of the female. Abductees report being impregnated
by the alien beings and later having an alien-human or human-human pregnancy removed. They see the little fetuses being put
into containers on the ships, and during subsequent abductions
may see incubators where the hybrid babies are being raised (as
do Catherine, Jerry, and Peter, among my cases). Experiencers
may also see older hybrid children, adolescents, and adults, which
they are told by the aliens or know intuitively are their own.
Sometimes the aliens will try to have the human mothers hold and
nurture these creatures, who may appear quite listless, or will encourage human children to play with the hybrid ones as, for example, Catherine is made to do.
Needless to say all of this is deeply disturbing to the
abductees, at least at first, or when the material first surfaces.
Their terror may be mitigated somewhat by reassurances the
aliens give that no serious harm will befall them, and by various
anxiety-reducing or anesthesia-like means they use. These involve instruments that affect the "energy" or "vibrations"
(words that abductees often use) of the body. These processes
may greatly reduce the abductees fear or pain, and even bring
about states of considerable relaxation. But in other cases they
are incompletely successful and terror, pain, and rage break
through the emotion-extinguishing devices used. As I will document in detail in several case examples, the traumatic, rapelike
nature of the abduction material may become altered as the
abductees reach new levels of understanding of what is occurring, and as their relationship to the beings themselves changes
in the course of our work.
In sum, the purely physical or biological aspect of the abduction phenomenon seems to have to do with some sort of genetic
or quasi-genetic engineering for the purpose of creating human-alien hybrid offspring. We have no evidence of alien-induced
genetic alteration in the strictly biological sense, although it is
possible that this has occurred.

INFORMATION AND THE ALTERATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
The other important, related aspect of the abduction phenomenon
has to do with the provision of information and the alteration of
consciousness of the abductees. This is not a purely cognitive
process, but one that reaches deeply into the emotional and spiritual lives of the experiencers, profoundly changing their perceptions
of themselves, the world, and their place in it. This information
concerns the fate of the earth and human responsibility for the destructive activities that are taking place on it. It is conveyed by the
direct mind-to-mind telepathic communication referred to above
and through powerful images shown on television monitor-like
screens on the ships themselves. The information may begin to be
conveyed when the abductees are children or adolescents (see Arthur, chapter 15, and Ed, chapter 3), but its implications are not
fully understood until much later. The investigator seems to play
an important part in enabling the abductee to bring forth and realize the significance of the information they have been receiving
during abductions that have been taking place over many years.
Scenes of the earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, vast panoramas of lifeless polluted landscapes and waters, and apocalyptic
images of giant earthquakes, firestorms, floods, and even fractures
of the planet itself are shown by the aliens. These are powerfully
disturbing to the abductees, who tend to experience them as literally predictive of the future of the planet. Some abductees are
given assignments in this future holocaust as it is displayed, such
as to feed the survivors, or are told, as in the prophetic books of
the Bible, that some will perish while others will be taken to another place to participate in the evolution of life in the universe.
Some abduction researchers believe that these images are not
shown for the purpose of altering the course of the planet's history
in a positive way. Rather, they maintain, the beings are studying
the experiencers' reactions and are deceiving them into believing
that they are concerned with our fate while they proceed to take
over our planet, their own having presumably been destroyed by
an apocalypse of science and technology similar to the fate that
might befall us (various personal communications 1990-93; also
Scott, chapter 5). They argue further that if the aliens were truly
concerned with our well-being they would manifest themselves
more forthrightly and intervene directly in our affairs in order to
make things better.
Abduction experiencers report that the aliens themselves, when
confronted with this issue, say that we are not ready to acknowledge their existence, and would treat them aggressively as an enemy as we do anyone or anything different from ourselves that we
do not understand. But most importantly, the aliens say, their
methods are different. Some abductees report that the aliens do not wish to bring about change through coercion but rather
through a change of consciousness that would lead to our choosing a different course. Some abductees receive information of battles for the fate of the earth and the control of the human mind,
between two or more groups of beings, some of which are more
evolved or "good," while others are less evolved or "evil."
The abductees usually report fewer details of their return to
Earth than they do of their abduction. Usually they are returned to
the bed or car from which they were taken, but sometimes "mistakes" are made. They may be returned quite a distance, or even
miles, away from their home. This is rare, and I have seen no
cases of this kind, although Budd Hopkins has told me of such instances. Smaller mistakes are more common, such as landing the
experiencer facing in the wrong direction on the bed, with his or
her pajamas on backwards or inside out, or with certain garments
or jewelry missing. Sometimes the aliens seem to be making a
point, or a certain humor is involved. One two-year-old among
my cases was tucked into his bed tightly after an abduction, which
the parents say that neither they nor his older sister had done; he,
of course, was incapable of doing this. Hopkins tells of a case
where two abductees were returned to the wrong cars. As they
drove along the highway the drivers recognized each other's cars.
They were "reabducted" and returned to the appropriate vehicles
(personal communication, December 1992).
After the abduction the experiencer may have varying degrees
of recollection of what occurred. Sometimes what happened will
be remembered as a dream. The abductee may wake with unexplained cuts or other lesions (the mucous membrane was reported
cut into and tissue taken from inside the nose and under the
tongue in one of my cases), small lumps under the skin, a headache, or nosebleed. Generally experiencers are quite tired afterwards and feel as if they have been through some sort of stressful
experience.

PHYSICAL ASPECTS
The physical phenomena that accompany abductions are important, but gain their significance primarily in that they corroborate
the experiences themselves; for the effects tend to be subtle and
would not by themselves convince a Western-trained clinician of
their meaning. For example, even though the abductees are certain
that the cuts, scars, scoop marks, and small fresh ulcers that appear on their bodies after their experiences are related to the phys-
ical procedures performed on the ships, these lesions are usually
too trivial by themselves to be medically significant. Similarly,
abductees will often experience that they have been pregnant and
have had the pregnancy removed during an abduction, but there is
not yet a case where a physician has documented that a fetus has
disappeared in relation to an abduction (Druffel 1991; Miller and
Neal 1995; Neal 1992). Many abductees have noted that electrical
or electronic devices-television sets, radios, electric clocks,
telephone answering machines, electric lights, and toastersmalfunction in relation to abductions, or simply when the experiencers are nearby. But it is. almost impossible to prove that these
disturbances are related to the abduction process,. or even that they
have occurred at all.
Abductees are frequently convinced that some sort of homing
object has been inserted in their bodies, especially in the head but
other parts as well, so that the aliens can track or monitor them,
analogous, the abductees themselves will observe, to the way we
track animals with various devices. These so-called implants may
be felt as small nodules below the skin, and in several cases tiny
objects have been recovered and analyzed biochemically and
electromicroscopically. MIT physicist David Pritchard, who has
also been analyzing an implant that came out · of a man's penis,
has written about the criteria for examining and determining the
nature of such objects (Pritchard 1992). I have myself studied a
Y2- to �-inch thin, wiry object that was given to me by one of my
clients, a twenty-four-year-old woman, after it came out of her
nose following an abduction experience. Elemental analyses and
electronic microscopic photography revealed an interestingly
twisted fiber consisting of carbon, silicon, oxygen, no nitrogen,
and traces of other elements. A carbon isotopic analysis was not
remarkable. A nuclear biologist colleague said the "specimen"
was not a naturally occurring biological object but could be a
manufactured fiber of some sort. It seemed difficult to know how
to proceed further.
There is no evidence that any of the implants recovered are
composed of rare elements, or of common ones in unusual combinations. In discussions with a chemical engineer and other experts in materials technology, I have been told that it would be
extremely difficult to make a positive diagnosis of the nature of
any unknown substance without having more information about
its origins . Under the best of circumstances it would be difficult
to prove, for example, that a substance was not of terrestrial or
even human biological origins.
If, in fact, these objects were actually left in the human body by
alien beings, which would be virtually impossible to prove, it
would not be difficult for the aliens, in light of all the other (to
us) seemingly miraculous things of which they appear capable, to
adapt a small object to the human body by fanning it along the
lines of the body's own chemistry. If that were the case, the analysis would yield nothing unusual. This was actually my experience in the case of Jerry (chapter 6), who felt strongly that two
small nodules that appeared on her wrist following an abduction
experience had not been there before. She agreed to have these
removed by a surgeon colleague of mine, but the pathology laboratory found nothing remarkable about the tissue.
There was considerable excitement among abduction researchers when the first implant was "discovered." Here, at last, would
be the concrete physical proof of the reality of abductions, a real
object recovered from the alien world, the smoking gun that
would silence the critics. I am not now so sanguine that the phenomenon will reveal itself in this fashion. To hope so may even
be a sort of "error of logical types." In other words it may be
wrong to expect that a phenomenon whose very nature is subtle,
and one of whose purposes may be to stretch and expand our
ways of knowing beyond the purely materialist approaches of
Western science, will yield its secrets to an epistemology or methodology that operates at a lower level of consciousness (the point
is made in Eva's case, chapter 1 1). Because of the relative thinness of the physical findings, however genuine, a heavy burden of
evidence for the reality of the abduction phenomenon falls upon
the reported experiences, or "witnessing" of the experiencers
themselves.
A theory that would even begin to explain the abduction phenomena will have to account for five basic dimensions. These are:
1. The high degree of consistency of detailed abduction accounts,
reported with emotion appropriate to actual experiences told by
apparently reliable observers.
2. The absence of psychiatric illness or other apparent psychological or emotional factors that could account for what is being
reported.
3. The physical changes and lesions affecting the bodies of the
experiencers, which follow no evident psychodynamic pattern.
4. The association with UFOs witnessed independently by others while abductions are taking place (which the abductee may not
see).
5. The reports of abductions by children as young as two or three
years of age (see Colin in chapter 6).
Clearly, no explanation that addresses all of these elements is
apparent at the present time.

IMPACT AND SEQUELAE OF ABDUCTION EXPERIENCES
Needless to say, abductions profoundly affect the lives of those
who experience them. These effects are traumatic and disturbing,
but they can also be transforming, leading to significant personal
change and spiritual growth. Whether this transformational element is intrinsic to the abduction phenomenon itself, dependent in
part on integrative therapeutic work with the investigator, or is a
by-product of coming to terms with the traumatic nature of the experiences, is one of the questions that will be explored in this
book.

TRAUMA
The traumatic aspect has four dimensions. First are the experiences themselves. To be paralyzed and taken against one's will by
strange beings into a foreign enclosure and subjected to intrusive,
rapelike procedures, some of which are especially humiliating to
human dignity, is obviously highly disturbing. In this ligh� it is
surprising that abductees as a group are not more emotionally
troubled than they are.
Second, abductees experience a lifelong sense of isolation and
estrangement from those around them. Whether or not they recall
consciously many elements of their experiences, abductees feel
that they are somehow different or "other," that they do not belong in this society even if, superficially at least, they seem to get
along well. As children they have commonly been told that the
abduction-related events they describe are dreams, or even that
they are lying, so experiencers learn to keep these matters to
themselves and feel very much alone with their experiences. One
savvy eight-year-old abductee looked at me incredulously when I
asked him if he told his friends about his "encounters," which he
was able to distinguish sharply from dreams, even when they had
to do with UFOs. "No, I don't tell anybody that I don't know that
well," he said. "I just don't want them to know that I have encounters. I think that a lot of people I know get scared if they hear
scary stories . . . I guess people are like, 'Hey ! That's too
weird!' " This boy is, in fact, popular with other children and his
teachers and they find nothing unusual about him. As adults too,
abductees learn not to talk about their experiences, except under
trusting circumstances, knowing that they are likely to be met
with skepticism and false interpretation, if not outright derision.
Third, abductees experience what I have called "ontological
shock" as the reality of their encounters sinks in. They, like all of
us, have been raised in the belief that we on Earth are largely
alone in the universe and that it would simply not be possible for
intelligent beings to enter into our world without using a highly
advanced form of our technology and obeying the laws of our
physics. Abductees tend to persist in the hope that a psychological
explanation for their experiences will be found, even when they
tell me that what has happened to them is as real as the conversation we are having.
Finally, abduction-related traumas are unusual in that they can
recur at any time. Most traumas, such as war-related experiences,
rape, or childhood abuse, are fmite; they occur and then are over,
even if they persist during a given period of time. But abductions
are unpredictable and their recurrence in an individual's life follows no foreseeable pattern. Parent abductees will commonly first
seek to investigate their own experiences when they discover that
one or more of their children are having abduction encounters.
The discovery that they cannot fulfill their protective responsibilities as a parent will breach their denial and motivate them to confront their own buried experiences so they can be more helpful to
their children.
In addition to these specifically traumatic long-term effects,
abductees may also suffer from a number of long-term symptoms
that, though subtle, they relate to their abduction experiences.
These include various fears, discussed earlier, such as of hospitals
and needles, as well as symptoms such as headaches, nasal sinus
pains, limb pains, gastrointestinal and urological-gynecological
symptoms, and disturbances of sexual functioning (Jerry, chapter 6). It is somewhat ironic in view of these pathological sequelae ·
that so many abductees have experienced or witnessed healing of
conditions ranging from minor wounds to pneumonia, childhood
leukemia, and even in one case reported to me firsthand, the overcoming of muscular atrophy in a leg related to poliomyelitis.
It is interesting that not all abductees experience the intrusive,
traumatic procedures that have come to be seen as characterizing
the phenomenon (for example, Arthur, chapter 1 5). I do not think
this is simply a matter of resistance or denial. Some individuals
seem to be "selected" primarily to be instructed, even "enlightened," a kind of "reprogramming," as one woman puts it, by beings that are usually of the subtler or luminous sort. Perhaps these
individuals, who seem to have spiritual leadership qualities, have
a different consciousness, are more fearless--or more willing to
be out of control and move through their terror-than other
abductees. It is a question that deserves further study.
As will be discussed in several cases in this book, an abduction
history can place a great strain on a marital or other intimate relationship. This is especially the case when one member of the
couple is an experiencer and the other not only evidently is not,
but finds that he or she cannot accept the reality of the spouse's
experiences. Relationships are also disrupted when one member of
the couple undergoes significant personal development, directly or
indirectly resulting from their experiences, leaving the spouse
more or less behind (Eva, chapter 11 ).

TRANSFORMATIONAL OR CONSCIOUSNESS ALTERING ASPECTS
I will devote more attention in this book to the transformational
and spiritual growth aspects of the abduction phenomenon than
has been the case in other literature on the subject. There are several reasons for this decision. First, I believe that this feature of
the phenomenon has either been neglected or has been viewed as
incompatible with the traumatic dimension of an abduction as it
has most often been described. Second, it is my impression that
this largely unresearched area is of considerable significance. Finally, and most interesting, I think, is my personal experience as
a psychiatrist dealing with abductees: I seem to receive more information of this kind in my work with abductees than, apparently, do other investigators. It is not altogether clear why this is
so. Perhaps my caseload is preselected, biased in the direction of
individuals who, in seeking the help of a psychiatrist, deepen their
understanding of their experience through exploration of their
consciousness. Possibly, abductees sense that I am open to hearing
about experiences or information that might be considered too
"far out" for most investigators, and my own personal evolution
may, in fact, have made me more open to the information they are
seeking to convey. In any event, I try to be as scrupulous as I can
not to lead clients in any particular direction, so that if information that is relevant to the spiritual or consciousness-expanding aspects of the abduction phenomenon emerges during our sessions,
it will do so freely and spontaneously and not as a result of specific inquiries of mine.
I will briefly outline the types of experiences that could be
placed in this category. Of overriding importance is the shift that
needs to occur in the relationship between the experiencer and the
alien beings before consciousness-altering information can be received. Although the relationship with the aliens may have been
playful, even intimate, in early childhood, it tends to change to a
more disturbing and traumatic one as puberty approaches and the
reproductive hybrid "project" begins. As traumatic intrusions take
place, the abductees tend to feel themselves to be victims of hostile beings who regard them coldly, or simply as specimens in a
project that serves the needs of the aliens. They may feel betrayed
by the alien beings as the nature of their interaction changes.
But as our work deepens, especially as the power of this extraordinary alien encounter is acknowledged and the abductees
come to accept their lack of control of the process, the frightening
and adversarial quality of the relationship seems to give way to a
more reciprocal one in which more mutual human-alien communication can take place. The abductees may even experience a profound love for the alien beings-in some ways more powerful
than the love they experience in human relationships-and may
feel that this love is returned. Connection through the eyes seems
to play an important part in the evolution of this process.
Whereas, for example, the abductees felt bitterly resentful about
having their sperm and eggs used by the aliens in the hybridization project, they may come to feel that they are participating in
a process that has value for the creation and evolution of life.
There are those who might argue that such a shift in stance by
the abductees in the face of the ongoing helplessness of the abduction situation is in fact a defensive shift, even self-delusion in
the service of mitigating pain and distress. It could be considered
an attempt by the ego to retain a sense of mastery by giving away
voluntarily what will be taken by force, or an attempt to reduce
cognitive dissonance by believing that the emotional cost of such
a traumatic experience can be balanced by providing something
good and positive for the universe. On the other hand, it is possible that working through the shattering experience of the abduction may give abductees access to experiences of transpersonal
meaning, universal love, and connectedness that make such compassion possible. ·
As is true of so many aspects of the abduction phenomenon, it
is difficult in the area of transformational or spiritual growth-
related experiences to separate cause and effect, or even to think
in causal terms at all. Does an abductee, for example, receive (and
communicate) information about a past life experience because his
consciousness is open to the possibility of such matters? Or will
the emergence into consciousness of the memory of a past life, itself facilitated by our work together, bring about an expanded personal horizon and a broadening of the sense of self in relation to
the larger fabric of universal consciousness?
The fact that the relationship between the abductees and the
aliens can evolve so dramatically over time makes me question
categorizations of the beings into constructive, good, and loving
ones and others that are deceptive and hostile, bent on taking over
our planet-the idea that the light beings are good or caring, for
example; the grays are businesslike and indifferent. This kind of
taxonomy smacks suspiciously of the sorts of polarization that
characterizes human group or ethnonational relationships and
could have little to do with the way interspecies or interdimensional relationships, if their actuality were to become established,
might work beyond the earth. Furthermore, it is common for
abductees to experience, for example, both light beings and little
grays (Arthur, chapter 15) or reptilian and other sorts of beings
(Carlos, chapter 14 ), during the same abduction. It is possible that
we are dealing with relationship processes that are evolutionary in
nature and not comprehensible in the linear terms of our familiar
polarities.
Types of experience during abductions that appear to be related
to personal growth and transformation are as follows:
1. "Pushing through" occurs, i.e., fully experiencing the terror
and rage associated with the helplessness and intrusive instrumentation on the ships. When this takes place acknowledgment
and acceptance of the power of the experiences becomes possible and a more reciprocal relationship follows in which personal growth and learning can take place. From the "ego death" follow other levels of transformation:
2. The aliens may be perceived as intermediaries or intermediate
entities between the fully embodied state of human beings and
the primal source of creation or "God" (in the sense of a cosmic consciousness, rather than a personified being). In this regard abductees sometimes liken the alien beings to angels, or
other "light beings" (including the "grays").
3. The abductees may actually experience themselves as returning
to their cosmic source or "Home," an inexpressibly beautiful realm beyond, or not in, space/time as we know it. When this
occurs during a hypnosis session, powerful, inexpressibly joyous, even orgiastic feeling occurs. Conversely, abductees may
weep with sadness when they experience having to leave their
cosmic home, return to Earth and become embodied once
again.
4. "Past lives" are experienced during the sessions with strong
emotion appropriate to what material is emerging. This is most
likely to occur when the investigator picks up on cues in the
sessions during which encounters from infancy are being reexperienced. Complaints or simply observations of being here
on Earth "again," of being "back" or having "returned" are
voiced (about which I then inquire). The "past lives" that
emerge seem to have relevance to the personal development or
evolution of the experiencer, as I have seen in the cases of
Dave and Joe.
5. Past life experiences provide abductees (and the investigator)
with a different perspective about time and the nature of human identity. Cycles of birth and death over long stretches of
time can thus be relived, providing a different, less ego derived
sense of the continuity of life and the smallness of an individual lifetime from a cosmic perspective. Consciousness is experienced as not coterminous with the body; the notion of a soul
with an existence separate from the body becomes relevant.
6. Once the separateness of consciousness from the body is
grasped, other kinds of "transpersonal" experiences become
possible; identification of consciousness with virtually endless
kinds of beings and entities through space/time and beyond often occurs. Paul (chapter 10), among my cases for example,
found himself during our sessions identified with dinosaurs or
dinosaur-like reptiles from another era and experienced himself
present at the site of a UFO crash several decades ago when
alien beings were destroyed by human fear and aggression.
Another abductee, a young Brazilian man, found that his alien
encounters opened him to the identification with the myths and
spirit entities of his culture's folklore, from which his Western
scientific and intellectual training had cut him off.
7. A distinct but important aspect of this kind of transpersonal
experience is an abductee 's sense of possessing a double
human/alien identity. In their alien selves they may discover
themselves doing many of the things that the "other" aliens
have done to them and to other human beings, such as studying their minds or even carrying out reproductive procedures.
The alien identity seems to be connected in some way with the
soul of the human self, and one of the tasks the abductee then
confronts is the integration of their human and alien selves,
which takes on the character of a reensoulment of their humanity.
8. The reliving of abduction material leads abductees to open to
other realities beyond space/time, realms that are variously described as beyond a "veil" or some other barrier which has
kept them in a "box" or in a consciousness limited to the physical world. When asked about these experiences abductees
have trouble finding the words to describe what has occurred
and speak of the "collapse" of space/time, of the nonrelevance
of the notions of space and time, and of being in multiple
times and places at the same moment.
The result of all these experiences for abductees is the discovery
of a new and altered sense of their place in the cosmic design, one
that is more modest, respectful, and harmonious in relation to the
earth and its living systems. Emotions of awe, respect for the
mystery of nature, and a heightened sense of the sacredness of
the natural world are experienced along with deep sadness about
the apparent hopelessness of Earth's environmental crisis. One of
John Carpenter's cases described herself as having become a
"child of the universe" after she had become conscious of her abduction experiences. The meaning and implications of these shifts
of consciousness for possible human futures will be discussed
more fully in the case examples and in the concluding chapter.
The thirteen cases presented in this book--eight men and five
women-were selected from the seventy-six abductees I have interviewed on the basis of the following criteria:
1. Their stories, although in some instances complex, seemed to
me sufficiently clear to permit a coherent narrative.
2. Each case appeared to illustrate in depth one or more central
aspects of the abduction phenomenon.
3. Each person was willing to have his or her story told, with or
without the use of his or her actual name.
4. I knew these individuals quite well. But there are abductees I
have known longer or worked with in greater depth. If I have
chosen not to tell their stories here it is because I could not do
justice to the richness of their experiences in a sufficiently
clear and concise manner.The sequence of cases reflects generally a kind of progression
from simpler stories to more complex multidimensional narratives.
The last case suggests what the abduction phenomenon may hold
for the transformation of our institutions and collective lives.

=================================================================
CHAPTER THREE. YOU WILL REMEMBER WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW

Ed is a technician in his mid-forties at a high tech firm in Massachusetts, married to Lynn, a writer with whom he shares an interest in science and technology. One day in the summer of 1989
Ed and Lynn were walking along the Marginal Way in Ogunquit,
Maine, a cliffside path that weaves along the rocky shore for several miles. Suddenly Ed found himself becoming tense, moody,
and withdrawn. He then became sweaty and worried and grabbed
Lynn's hand tightly. He had no idea what his distress was about.
Ed was practicing meditation and believes that this may have contributed to his eventual recovery of important material. Ed has
also had a number of frightening childhood · experiences which
could be abduction-related. These will be discussed in the context
of his hypnosis, or relaxation, session. From early childhood Ed
was unusually fearful of doctors' offices and operations­
"anything to do with medicine"--even before his tonsillectomy at
about age nine.
One day at the seashore, a week or so after the walk in
Ogunquit, following a day of relaxation, he says, "it came to me."
Ed began to recall an experience from the summer of 1961 when
he was in high school. Over the next few months more details
came to his mind through what he called "flashbacks." Ed had
had some interest in what he calls "alien intelligence." As a result
of his memories he became interested in the UFO phenomenon
and attended a MUFON (the citizen-based Mutual UFO Network) conference in New Hampshire. Several people he met through this
network suggested he contact me, and so he telephoned my office
in July 1992. Since then I have interviewed Ed and Lynn for several hours and have conducted a hypnosis, or relaxation, session
with him with the aim of recovering more information about his
high school experience. He and Lynn have also been attending my
support group.
Ed's case is important for two principal reasons. First, the timing 
of his teenage experience and his recall of it suggest a process
of information reception, storage, recovery, and integration of
great purpose and potential power. Second, the narrative which Ed
was able to recover in an altered state of consciousness appears,
from what we know of the abduction phenomenon, to be much
more plausible than the account he could provide from conscious
memory. This supports the argument for the power of hypnosis to
recover memories of abductions that are both meaningful and true
to the actual experience (whatever the source of these experiences
may ultimately prove to be), and suggests that, at least in the case
of UFO abductions, hypnosis may be more of a clarifying than a
distorting tool.
In what follows I will first tell the story of young Ed's abduction experience as he remembered it in our initial meeting on
July 23, 1992. I will then bring in the rich details that he recovered in hypnosis on October 8 which he feels give meaning and
greater coherence to his experiences and subsequent life. Ed also
has less clear recollections of earlier childhood visitations.
In July 1961, Ed, his friend Bob Baxter, and Bob's parents took
a trip up the coast of Maine in the Baxters's Nash. One damp and
foggy night they stopped at a place where the shore was rocky;
Ed does not recall exactly where except that it was north of Portland. The Baxters stayed in a cabin while the boys slept nearby in
the Nash, which had fold-down seats in the back. The car was
parked perhaps a hundred yards from the sea. Ed and Bob had
been talking about how "horny" they were and "speculated about
the great encounters we were going to have at the beach." Ed believes he had been asleep when "the next thing I know I'm out on
this precipice" in a "pod" that had "some sort of a glass bubble
over it." He reported being naked in a small room with transparent curved walls. The room felt warm and safe, but Ed could see
the pounding surf and "hear the wind buffeting around outside."
He believes he could hear strains of melodious, light classical music coming perhaps from houses nearby. There is no question in
Ed's mind that this really happened, although he calls the experience "beyond language."

With Ed in the pod was a small, slight female figure with long,
straight, thin silvery-blond hair. Although Ed could recall no specific earlier abduction experiences, the figure "had familiar aspects to her," and he had vague, "very sinister," memories of
"something out there" from his childhood. The female entity had
a small mouth and nose, intense large dark eyes, and a "sort of triangular" shaped head with a "largish" forehead. "I had this uncomfortable feeling that every time she looked at me she could
just see right into me." He found her "attractively unusual" and
felt "a little self-conscious." The figure, perhaps sensing this,
"gave me some sort of blanket or big towel or something." She
seemed to sense his thoughts without his saying anything, reassuring Ed, for example, that they were safe and would not fall off the
precipice onto the rocks below. Ed was sexually excited, and the
female being "sensed my horniness." Although he was "hazy" as
to how this came about, Ed said, "we had intercourse." According
to Ed this act was "similar" to human sexual intercourse with
"fondling of the breasts," insertion of the penis in the vagina, and
active participation by both individuals. Interestingly, although Ed
was a virgin at this time, he did not recall this experience and still
felt himself to be a virgin when he had sexual intercourse some
time later.
After the sex, which Ed said was "fulfilling" and "great," he
sensed that the female wanted to get on with a "bigger agenda - You know, you take care of the immediate physical needs, and
you get on to the lesson." Her attitude was "now we'll get down
to business . . . like a teacher. You might settle your students by
telling them a light story when they first come in the classroom,
just get them settled, focused, and then kind of lead them into ...
Then she started explaining things to me." Ed wanted to write
things down so he could remember later, but she would not let
him and "just worked at my perception by awareness, sort of
mind to mind." Sensing his frustration she assured him, "You will
remember when you need to know."
In this interview Ed's recall of the content of the information
this female entity gave to him was sketchy, but he remembers that
he felt "dumbfounded" with "my mouth hanging open." He had
had a traditional Roman Catholic upbringing, attending parochial
school until the fourth grade, and nothing he had been taught prepared him for messages of such spiritual or cosmic import. Ed
feels that somehow the alien being opened his consciousness.
"She wired me into my emotions, and at some point early in the
encounter, perhaps during the 'foreplay, ' 'interplay,' orgasmic parts of it, like she sort of gains either a clinical judgment of my
emotional/mental typography, or gained my agreement to go on to
part two. She looked at me and said, 'Well, do you think you can
handle the next part?' "
Some of the information concerned "the way humans are conducting themselves here in terms of international politics, our environment, our violence to each other, our food, and all that. And
she kept explaining that the laws of the universe are this way, and,
it's like, if you're driving on the wrong side of the road, what's
going to happen inevitably, you know. It's like here are the laws,
and here's the way you humans conduct your affairs, and slam,
bang, you know, it's inevitable ... " Ed's father was a machinist
by trade working at a major firm in the New England region and
Ed's idea, inculcated in his "flag-waving" family, was that he
would be a "techie," go into electronics and help to "beat the
damn communists . . . We gotta develop more, better technology
to kill those damn Commies before they kill us."
Although the information was largely new to Ed, it somehow
"made sense to me." He had a "scientific bent towards things,"
and she explained things in "scientific, logical terms ... elucidating a, series of interrelated concepts, that these are the laws of the
universe, specifying in detail these concepts. And you know, here,
you geniuses on the planet doing this and that, and this is the way
the thing should operate, and you're out of harmony, and at some
point the sheets get balanced out. Sooner or later. And I'm standing there, oh my God. It's like she gave me this second, this
safety mechanism of embedding it deep in my core . . . I just sat
there, like, you know, like, oh my God, it's, it was like trauma
time . . . deep anxious concern over the path I could see us humans taking ... a world trauma."
Ed was told of the "heavily destructive" path we were taking,
which was also destructive to the "humanoid's planet." He feels
that his whole psyche was permanently changed by this encounter.
"How do I put it? She said that with my acquiescence that I was,
my emotions, my cognitions, my whole perceptions, were going
to be modified, and that my style of functioning would be slightly
different. The closest analogy I can give is like changing some of
the software architecture and some of the hardware in the computer. At first when you sit down to work with it you may not see
it, but then you say, wait a minute, now, the software works differently, faster. It"s got more capability." She also assured Ed that
he would no longer be traumatized by negative alien visitations.
"She sensed in my mind an awareness about previous encounters
with a negative type of alien and said, 'Yes, yes, yes, that's in the
past now. They won't be around. They won't be able to mess with
you anymore.' " She "made reference to ... her own people, positive aliens, as a group that came from someplace else" and explained that the team that was with her served as her "supporting
staff."
Subsequent to the encounter, Ed found himself making intuitive
and somewhat impulsive statements on social, political, and scientific matters, and "other kids would look at me and say, 'Boy, is
he weird.' " Although not especially accomplished in the conventional academic sense, Ed found that he had an instinctive appreciation of modern physics and modern chemistry, of such matters
as Einsteinian relativity, micro- and macrorealities, the curvature
of space, and the paradoxes in scientific laws. He also found he
could talk of these things to other teenagers in his high school
class so that they would say, "Yeah, that makes sense." These
changes in Ed seemed to intrigue his teachers.
Ed's intention had been to be a flag-waving supertechie, but
once in engineering school he found himself "frozen emotionally"
and "angry, frustrated, and despondent." After less than a semester at an engineering college, he transferred to a small liberal arts
college where he tried "to find out what makes civilization tick,
trying to understand the nature and structure of human civilization." He became interested in "the pageant of history, Rome,
Greece, and all" and what he calls "the bigger quest."
Although Ed is aware of no further encounters, he senses now
that his teenage experience lingered within him, and he sometimes
has had brief flashbacks or glimpses of the cove or other geography where the experience took place. In his twenties and thirties
he became somewhat of a loner. He would be stirred by pictures
of blond women and sometimes when bicycling "whenever I'd
see a woman of a slight build [with] long blond hair I'd try to
pedal up to see her" and he'd think "Geez, is that her?" But he
would be disappointed that "it's not her." Both Ed and his wife
Lynn have Nordic roots. They met at a cultural organization
where both were studying Northern European literature and history. Lynn "felt like I knew him already." In addition to their
common interests in science and technology, nature, and the outdoors, Lynn has blond hair. After five years of spending time with
each other they were married in the late 1970s. The couple is
childless, although they have been trying to have children. There
have been a number of fertility problems, which may or may not
be abduction-related, including three or four spontaneous terminations of Lynn's pregnancies. Lynn herself has had a missing-time
episode and other experiences that make her suspect that she has
also had encounters.
When I met Ed he was having trouble finding his proper
"niche," was "lost in the desert," and "beating his head against
the wall." Lynn believes that this may have contributed to their
difficulty in having children, for "we' ve been in sort of suspended
animation, waiting for the light to go on."
Ed has always felt especially close to nature, to woods, trees,
and plants and feels that he can "talk to plants." He feels a desperate "race with the earth," a need to put together the pieces of
what he knows "like an erector set," and that he has been challenged to do this. He has practiced meditation and studied Eastern
philosophy in his struggle to find his authentic path. He and Lynn
both feel that Ed's "time in the desert" may have been worthwhile
and that out of all the things he has tried he may find a way to
integrate his ecological and spiritual commitments with his technological and scientific abilities.
At the end of the first session we discussed the fact that Ed's
teenage experience occurred two months before the Betty and
Barney Hill case that began the modern history of abduction experiences, and he expressed with some conflict a desire to gain
access to further material, especially of the information that the
female alien provided him in the capsule, through hypnosis.
After our initial meeting, Ed found himself becoming increasingly troubled "in the name of the future" about "eco-instability"
and "assaults upon the earth." He increasingly longed for guidance as to what he might do and felt pressed to discover more of
"what was it she told me?" He felt awed by a sense of responsibility, as "I'm not like JFK's nephew or something ... I have this
intuitive feeling that what she told me is damn important, important for my unfoldment-I'm afraid to even say for the earth's unfoldment. I mean, I'm no messianic leader that thousands are
going to follow." He was determined to go deeper into his experience from that night in Maine with the use of hypnosis, and a
session was scheduled for October 8, eleven weeks after our first
interview.
Before the regression Ed and I went over in more detail the
misty quality of that July night, the location of the Nash in relation 
to the sea (about a hundred yards away on the other side
of a road), the cabins where Bob's parents were staying, and,
the gently rocky nature of the coast where they were to spend the
night (compared to the more rugged terrain and sweep of the
coastal cove by the promontory where the pod was perched). I
had him describe the car's fold-down seats and the two boys' bedtime preparations, which I went over in still more detail during the
hypnosis session itself. As he talked of getting ready to go to
sleep that night, he referred to nighttime fears from perhaps age
four when he would wake up in terror, screaming for his parents,
after having dreamed of going down a path "into a field on some
railroad tracks, and then the railroad tracks would disappear into
some sort of starlit, black night." During the period when he had
this dream he had "deep anxiety about going to sleep at night"
and was afraid to be in his room by himself in the dark.
After the induction of the hypnotic relaxation, I explored further details of the boys' bedtime preparations with Ed. He described Mrs. Baxter's motherly fussing over the boys' warmth and
comfort and remembered that he slept in a sleeping bag while
Bob slept with blankets. He again recalled his and Bob's talk of
girls ("we' re still virgins"). He remembered the sound of cars going by on the road, the fog "shrouding in," and that he felt "a little 
uncomfortable deep inside of me about problems or something,
I don't know." As Ed described "drifting off, going into my
thoughts," he felt "some tingling" in the area of the base of his
head or upper neck and then found himself "getting frightened."
The tingling sensations increased and Ed said, "I sense something around the car." He thinks he had been asleep but is not
sure, dreaming perhaps of "getting it on" with a nice teenage girl
from one of the area beaches. But then he saw one or two figures
through the car windows, a "couple of human sort of things, but
cripes, their eyes are big! You know, they're not spiders, and I
don't think I'm dreaming." The figures "don't look like normal
humans." They had "big black-gray, or black, eyes and intense,
small mouths. Some sort of earlike thing . . . In this damn, this
fog, I can't quite make out what you guys look like, you guys are
clever. You know how to use camouflage." The beings were of a
"slightly different type" than he had seen before. Ed's fear
mounted in the session and he recalled feeling "just mortified, like
somebody's ready to jump me, and I'm gonna fuckin" fight for
my goddamn life."
As the tingling sensation "at the base of the skull" continued,
Ed felt himself drifting out of the car. He made a growling sound
as his anger came back, but then felt relaxed and even "happy,"
which puzzled him. Two or three of the beings were "looking at
me" and Ed experienced "a sensation of floating, and my whole
body is starting to float. I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating!Why am I floating?" At this point in the session Ed felt confused
and tried to "keep control of what's going on." I encouraged him
to stay with his actual experience. He then saw a gray fog around
him, "the tingling sensation going further into all parts of my
skull," and he was "vaguely aware of scenery changing ... This
is certainly many steps beyond the TV program One Step Beyond," Ed noted. "I keep trying to control it, but I'm trying to not
control it. I, my mind, doesn't want to go and get back there."
Then he said, "I'm sort of like zapping through all this cellular,
atomic-type structure, and I'm seeing, I'm just penetrating through
it. I just penetrate. It just keeps coming and coming and coming."
Then Ed felt himself "going down this time tunnel" and literally "traveling" with "no reference point . . . I'm aware of
some process of transporta-I'm aware of some movement of
some sort." He continued fighting ("The rules of the street are
you fight like hell"), but realized that the rules by which he operates did not apply and "they' re overriding me somehow or
other" so that "I have no choice [but] to let it happen" and "it did
happen."
Next Ed felt himself to be "very stiff" and "out someplace
along the shoreline, floating, someplace." He recalled hearing the
"surf pounding" and became more perplexed about the fact that
he was "moving above the water, somewhere along the coast,
with no visible means of propulsion," although he did "have a
funny feeling that they're around me someplace." He felt that the
beings were "very gentle" without "mental intimidation" or
"harshness to their physical treatment of me," but "definitely, we
are in control, thank you." Ed had the sense that he was moving
about as fast as a car, perhaps fifty or sixty miles per hour, and
could make out "houses and streetlights, maybe a car here and
there, a porch light, maybe a TV" below him. He was embarrassed at the thought that someone might see him. "Geez, if anybody looks up and sees some guy in his pajamas floating along,
cripes ... I might be embarrassed, geez, if my mother ever heard
about it. She'd chew me out. Jesus Christ! Proprieties and everything."
Ed found this material so extraordinary that he wondered out loud, "Am I bullshitting you?" 
"I don't know. Are you?" I asked. 
"No, no," he said, "because this keeps coming back, and I
sense, I, the sincerity of myself says it's not coming from just, it's not I'm just making this up." But, "It doesn't fit what's supposed ,
to happen ... This is what you submit to a script to Twilight Zone ... It doesn't fit anything I would have seen on the tube or
at the theater." Ed found that he was "approaching this outcrop of
land, and the surf, and all that, and I'm seeing some sort of luminescent, domelike pod." Then "I'm being dragged in a sense that
I have no control over my body ... towards the bottom ... somewhere on the bottom I feel like I'm coming through, and I don't
know how we got through the bottom, but here I am." This was
evidently physically possible because the craft seemed to be "just
suspended there," protruding beyond the rocky outcropping.
"Parts of it are near the rock, and other parts of it are just, they're
kind of just over the rock."
Inside the vehicle Ed noted a bluish-silver glowing light. He
felt his vision was being limited and he was angry. "I hate being
in this position of no control. I hate this. I hate this, damn it! I
hate this ! So stupid, so goddamn stupid, for Crissakes ! How will
I explain this to anybody?" He had a pain in the front of his head
and was confused, "disoriented mentally and physically ... My
wallet's in the house. I have no ID with me." He also had an
erection which embarrassed him-"this is not part of my upbringing."
There were "at least half a dozen" beings in the room which he
called "an amphitheater" and "sort of like a surgery theater" or
"an O.R." and "there's these white lights around." One of the beings seemed to be "the head doctor, in charge." This one "gives
off all the vibrations of being a female." The others he called
"drones" or "staff people just milling around doing whatever."
The female being had long, silvery hair with large, black eyes
without pupils or irises. She was looking at Ed "with those loving, big, sensuous eyes and they exude a loving sexuality, like
she's a very wise, mature woman conveying telepathically to
me-'I have control of the situation.' " She was wearing a
"dresslike, long smock," open at the neck that covered her arms
and shoulders. He noted that "She has breasts ... Maybe there's
some sort of a pendant or medallion thing around, dangling from
her neck on some sort of a chain, or pin, can't quite make out."
The female being "thinks" his name to him and Ed asked,
"How do you know me," observing, "You look very sexy." Although she was staring at Ed ("she looks right into me"), he felt
she was not letting him look at her. He seemed to be trying to
bring forth a sound from his throat but "it won't come," and he
reexperienced the sense of being "totally shut down" that he had
felt originally. He found himself "sinking into a gray fog" as if
"enshrouded." The being told Ed, "You're okay. Don't fight it.Don't fight it." She knew his fear and was "reading my mind like
an open book." She said, "I know what happened to you when
you were younger" and assured Ed that "these things will not
happen again." His fear diminished and he said, "Somehow or
other you' re doing a great job of convincing me that you're here
for my well-being. I'm not just your laboratory rat, guinea pig"
(as he had felt in the past).
Ed recalled that he experienced some sort of forced arousal.
"She's filling my mind with all sorts of erotic escapades ... She's
just raising, somehow or other, she's just giving me, giving me a
hard-on." The female being knew that Ed wanted to have sex with
her-"She reads my mind like a book. She can just thumb
through the pages at her will." But with a "mirthful expression"
she told him something like, "Yeah, you'd like that wouldn't you,
but that's not the way it's going to be." Instead, she explained that
they needed his sperm for "their needs . . . to create special babies" and "for work we're doing to help the people on your
planet." Ed continued to struggle with his helplessness and lack of
control but was somewhat mollified and persuaded that he was
being used for something worthwhile.
Some sort of "tube" or "container'' was placed over Ed's penis
and he felt "very relaxed now." He experienced a rubbing sensation or friction, which built in intensity. "It's a very smooth, handlike thing. I want to believe it's her hand." After he ejaculated the
female being "thinks it to me, 'That was good. That was great,' "
in appreciation that they "got a good sample." He then felt hot
and sweaty. This completed the first part of the experience. Although Ed felt "at first they manipulated me to put me in the position where they could tell" him what they wanted, he soon felt,
"Okay, you convinced me that what you did was for some greater
good that I don't fully understand." Of the female alien he said,
"There's something very trusting about you, loving, caring, wanting to help." Then he added in some awe, "I' ve never been
through anything like this in my life."
At this point the scene changed, and Ed felt as if "I'm in a different space ... Before was more like an O.R.," but "now, all of
a sudden" he was in "the pod with translucent walls" that he had
remembered consciously before the hypnosis. He did not recall
"how I got from there to here." The female entity "wants to talk to me" and Ed felt scared about what was coming next. "A seriousness comes over me. It's like when the doctor or the teacher comes in and says 'now the heavies ... now the serious part ... ; now we think we can tell you things.' " He noticed that the female being, "the spokesperson," was wearing a "silvery, somewhat metallic tunic. It's sort of a weave, woven/knit sort of thing
with some sort of shimmery stuff on it, and I can see her exquisite
breasts jutting from beneath it." She had a "gentle grin" and was
"looking at me very lovingly." Ed felt that the inside of his head
and his eyes were "burning and spinning" as she began to talk to
him and he was shown different things.
The remaining forty to forty-five minutes of our hypnosis regression was taken up with Ed's recollection of the information he
received during the abduction. The sequence of our dialogue may
not reproduce altogether accurately the order in which these
thoughts and images came to him at that time.
The narrative was filled with apocalyptic images. The being
communicated to him telepathically in what Ed calls "allegorical
terms" a message of "instability on your planet, eco-spiritual,
emotional instability ... Volcanic eruptions are a sign ... It's allegorical towering plumes of eruptive rage. Not ejaculations of ecstasy, but eruptions of anguish. Be careful. Pounding waves of
eruption, watering, rushing, and engulfing about and around you."
Ed protested, "Why do you talk to me in allegory? I'm no poet."
'But the relentless communication continues. "Towering, pounding surf, shifting plates, instability, Earth shuddering in anguish,
crying, weeping at the stupidity of humans losing contact with the
inner soul of their being." She said to him, "You have a chance,
Ed. You have an inner sensitivity." Again he protested, "But the
teachers always pound me for my grammar and spelling." But she
insisted, "You have a sensitivity, Ed. You pick up on things. You
can talk to the earth. The earth talks to you." He affirmed to me
that, indeed, as a small boy he would struggle with his mother because he loved to go into the woods (for which she would sometimes punish him by making him go to bed without supper or
spanking him). "Things talked to me," he said. "The animals, the
spirits ... I can sense the earth. I can sense the interplay of nature." The battle with his mother continued ("Only bad boys go in
the woods," she would say), but Ed was undeterred.
The female being, whose name he now recalled as something
like "Ohgeeka" or "Ageeka," picked up on these qualities and underscored the responsibility Ed has for his gifts and powers. "Listen to the earth. Listen to the earth, Ed. You can hear the earth.
You can hear the anguish of the spirits. You can hear the wailing
cries of the imbalances. It will save you. It will save you ...
Things are going to happen," she said, but he must "listen to
the spirits," even if he is taunted, and not feel overwhelmed. "She gave me a flash ... she opened up that channel and turned up the
volume. Some of [the spirits] are crying; some of them are mirthful. She just ran me through the whole thing in a couple of seconds. 'All this you can see, hear, and feel. Other people may think
you are crazy. ' " The earth itself, the being told him, is enraged
at our stupidity, and "the earth's skin is going to swat some bugs
off" that do not know how "to work in symbiotic harmony"
with it.
I asked Ed how this swatting off was going to happen. "Convulsions of the earth," he said, "almost like puking us off, or
shunning us off ... They will get rid of parts of us." Meanwhile,
the being kept telling Ed that he has a "greater agenda," and must
"Listen to the music of nature, the exquisite sounds of nature.
'The music will make sense to you, and it will leave a harmony
with your emotions, your intuitions, your hunches. You have a gift
with hunches, intuitions, and emotions.' " Ed, imbued with the
doctrine of his hierarchical Roman Catholic upbringing in which
"God talks with the Pope, and the Pope talks to the priests, who
then talk to my mother, my father," reacted cynically. "Yeah, I'm
gonna open up a tea leaf parlor. Put a turban on my head. Ten
bucks a pop." But the being cut through his sarcasm and insisted
that he own up to the gifts he was born with.
At this point he reported that he actually saw the spirits in the
form of "mirthful little playful creatures, just kind of, just bounding around." I asked him to describe them. "They're like energy
forms ... of many different kinds. There are many different shapes, colors" (he giggled at this point). He found "hilarious"
the "contortions" and "mirthful" things that they can do. I ask for
an example. They can "float around," he said and "change the laws of nature," by which he seemed to mean they can change shape and form. One of the spirits "is talking to me." He had long, silvery hair and an oversized head and is only a foot or two , tall, like a "micromidget." The spirit said, "Well, see, I put myself like this so you could sort of look at me and relate to me. But I I don't have to be like this if I don't want to be like this, and I can change myself into a multitude of forms ... I put myself into this
semihumorous shape so that you would feel comfortable and 
mirthful with me, because I know certain other types of creatures
you're " afraid of, like spiders, in particular, and snakes. So I'll
make myself like this !"
Then Ed said he realized that in some sense he and other human beings also "have the power to change the laws of nature if 
I access certain parts of my being," which frightened him. I asked 
what scared him. "Well, Jesus, if I blow it and use this power at
the wrong point ... "
"You are right, Ed. You are right, Ed," the female being told
him. He continued with her words, " 'You' ve got to learn how to
use this, when to use this, where to use this, or else they will take
you away ! And they will label you, and they will put you away,
away, away. And they will tell your parents, "poor Ed, he had
such promise but something happened, and Mrs. M. [his mother],
we' re terribly sorry." ' She's running this in my mind. 'The authority figures, "we'll have to put him away ... " ' " The being
spoke to him further about the task of cultivating his mind, warning, for example, about pursuing science in an orthodox academic
setting and fashion at the expense of his intuitive skills. "The
process of cultivating your mind in the traditional, rational way
will obliterate these other things, and you have seen all the infinite
possibilities," she said.
I asked Ed to say more about what he was told or shown about
these possibilities. He spoke of "seeing how the laws of the
universe are made" and "something about the point where the universe comes into birth." Again she warned him about misusing his
understanding. " 'You see the ambush of the planet now, ' she
said." At this moment in the session Ed felt "blocked from seeing" further. I asked him what he saw of the universe being born.
Ed: An incredibly blinding, searing white light.
JM: She showed you that?
Ed: Yes.
JM: What was that like for you?
Ed: Almost too much. But it was like, holy shit.
There's a particular chord or passage in Mahler's
tenth symphony. Goes like, it just opens up and
there it is. It's like a galaxy being born. It really is,
really is, really is this. "But [she says] I don't want
you to see too much of it. You have to know. You
must be wise in how you talk about this, and when
and where you talk about this. There are those that
will use your mind for asinine purposes."
I took him back to the glimpses he had of the anguish of the spirits. In addition to the "innocent play with nature, the way we're
supposed to be," Ed remembered seeing "distorted forms of entities, of spirits out here now because man has done so much damage, hurt and damage both to himself and to each other and to Mother Nature." He was shown "grotesque forms ... Horrific.
There's dark, gray, malignant forms that they were trying to heal,
or rebalance. It took a lot of effort [of the healthy spirits] to keep
these malignant forms from growing in magnitude and malignancy." The female entity continued, "You are distorting, growing
greater malignancy, trying to get yourself ... We're trying to keep
them under control and bring back into play. You see how malignant and deformed they are, Ed. They're gray, they're horrific,
distorted masses. You see how these energy forms, Ed, are so nice
and mirthful, and they look so healthy, and then there are these
others over here."
Ed spoke further of the communication he received about the
consequences of "our pillaging on the planet." The malignant, destructive forms, were created by the imbalance of "the collective
human psyche ... dark gray things that just come along and suck
up and destroy anything. They just go berserk, and they just zap
anything in their path, in their range." The ultimate result would
be that "they run their course," he said "until they work out all
this negative energy and return to normal, happy state. They' ve
got to work it out of their system, like getting the pus out of your
wound. It won't heal until you get the pus out of it."
I asked him what might be called for. He answered in terms of
what he has been told about his own survival in the face of the
"cataclysmic earth changes" that are to come. "She's telling me,
showing me that I have the tools within me to survive. I have this
extra dimension. I have the choice of listening to it or not . . . I
am to listen to my inner, something deep inside myself, and listen
to the earth." Ed's partner, Lynn, he realized, has known intuitively what the being has told him and "it doesn't faze her in the
least." His and Lynn's task would be to "to teach those human beings who will listen ... There are those who will listen before it
happens, and prepare themselves."
I asked if he was given any information about whether it was
still possible to prevent the cataclysm. "No, no, no," he said.
"There are not enough. Too few will listen, but those who will listen and can work with the laws of nature, will survive to teach
others on the other side who then will listen and say, 'Oh, geez,
we were screwed up back then.' " I expressed my lack of clarity
as to whether he meant "cataclysm" in a literal, physical, or metaphoric sense. He said there would be "a series of geological and
meteorological convulsions." Finding this all rather depressing I
asked how this information about spirits would help him or anyone else survive. Undeterred he said that "the spirits of the earth"
will "make safe havens" for those who will survive. I wondered
what was the use if everything was going to be destroyed. He said
that it was more a reconstitution-not just destruction-a
rebalancing, and repeated that "humans have to learn how to work
on this planet with the laws of nature and not plunder the earth,"
to use the "raw materials" in "the way they should be used."
Then "the earth will rebalance itself."
I remained confused about the literalness of all this and of the
various distinctions at work between spiritual and physical catastrophe. Ed had some difficulty understanding my confusion and
said "A person has to spiritually rebalance themselves. I have to
balance myself out spiritually to hear these messages. When I
hear these messages I will know on a physical level where to go
to work, those spots on the earth which will still be sacred and accessible." At this juncture we were both becoming somewhat tired
and agreed to end the session.
After I brought him out of the regression, Ed observed that this
information has always been "before my eyes" as if "on a page,"
but that he had "looked right by it ... She had it there for me all
the time," but "I was afraid to look at it." Ed felt awed by what
he had told me and spoke of the responsibility of translating his
"access into their dimension," his knowledge and concern for the
imminent breakdown of planetary systems, into usable terms for
the larger society. He experiences himself as a "Joe average" person with extraordinary information. "It's like trying to be Superman and Clark Kent. You can't go walking around in your cape
and tights all the time. You have to be a kind of Clark Kent.
"Love is the key," Ed said, "love and compassion for the earth
or the beings on the earth, be they corporeal or incorporeal-not
love in the mush and gush sense, but there is a deeper sense of
love." Both Ed and Lynn understand now why the female being
"put the dampers" on his remembering and talking about his experience. "If I had come back and . . . started talking" about his
knowledge of the laws of nature he might have been "whisked off
to make the bomb of the millennium." He still faces the dilemma
of how to be effective. "Who's going to listen to a mild-mannered
. . . technician?"
Ed did not experience his encounter and the recovery of memories related to it as markedly disturbing. "I don't find what 
happened to me traumatic, like in the case of the other people in the
encounter group [he had attended my support group for other
abductees a few weeks before] who were used like laboratory
rats." Instead he felt as if "a great cloud, a shroud has been pulled away from my awareness that has been sort of just there." We
talked further together about how, as Lynn put it, "to responsibly
take action." One step that we could agree on was the value of his
talking with other experiencers in order to share information and
to build the affinities of their growing community.

DISCUSSION
Although it is not uncommon for an experiencer to recall a single,
major encounter, it is interesting that Ed's occurred when he was
a teenager and was not recalled for nearly thirty years. The forces
involved in the implanting, storage, and recovery of information
remain among the central mysteries of the whole abduction phenomenon. As we have seen, Ed's teenage abduction experience
seemed to have worked subtly in his psyche throughout his life,
making him somehow different, perhaps more intuitive or aligned
with nature, than his contemporaries. Yet we do not know what is
cause and effect, whether his openness itself may have predisiposed him to being chosen for abduction experiences, whatever that may mean. We also do not understand completely why it
should suddenly happen that the material from the earlier experience returned. Yet it does appear that as a mature man he is in a better position to apply his knowledge in some sort of earthly calling, integrating the abduction-related information with his psychological gifts and professional expertise. It is not yet clear how he, with Lynn, might do this. The reported forced taking of sperm for some sort of poorly understood interspecies breeding program is characteristic of male abduction experiences. Information about ecological disaster with powerful apocalyptic imagery is also commonly described as being transmitted by the aliens to human subjects. What is somewhat unusual in Ed's case is the extent of the detail he was given
in a single abduction experience, and the fact that he originally received this information in the summer of 1961 two months before the Barney and Betty Hill abduction experience in September of that year. Much of what Ed was told or shown about the breakdown of planetary life systems and human violation of nature's
laws is well-known, at least within the environmental movement. 

A well-researched book like Donella Meadows's Beyond the Limits of Growth (Meadows 1992), makes clear the consequences, if
not the causes, of our continuing destruction of the earth's environment. What is of particular interest is the power of the information for someone like Ed. His learning was not simply intellectual. The realities he experienced being transmitted to him
by the female alien, of impending ecological and spiritual disaster
as the result of human disharmony with nature, were felt deeply
in every part of his being. As he said himself, his whole self, his
"entire perception," was changed by the encounter.
It is not clear how literally to regard the apocalyptic visions Ed
has reported receiving. They have the quality of prophetic tradition, warning of disaster and of the need for fundamental change.
Whether they are concretely predictive, or calls for change and action, cannot, of course, be answered. That Ed has taken the information seriously enough to change his life and commit himself to
communicating what he has learned to others who will listen is
certain.
Ed's report of direct encounters during the abduction experience
with shape-shifting spirits that have actual form is interesting, as
is the actualization of negative emotional forces in the shape of
malignant or demonic spirits. The Western worldview has no
place for such entities, tending to regard them as the products of
fantasy or the projections of the psyche, although they are believed in or their existence acknowledged by other cultures
throughout the world. For example, in a meeting in India in April
1992, in which I participated with a small group of professionals
who were invited to discuss the abduction phenomenon with Tibetan leaders, the lamas saw the reported alien beings as spirits
that have become upset by the invasion and destruction of the
earth's environment, which they inhabit as well. A Tibetan physician explained that as a result of our ignorance, material attachment, and aggression, manifested by the desecration of the planet,
these spirits have become annoyed and irritated and are causing
"negative disturbances." A leading spiritual figure among the Tibetans also saw the reported aliens as spirits that have become so
troubled by human destruction of the realms they inhabit that they
have been forced to come among us, seeking our compassion and transformation.
A final word needs to be said about the use of hypnosis in Ed's
case. Before my first meeting with him, Ed had recalled a great
deal about his ·teenage abduction experience. But his conscious
memory before the regression tended to simplify the experience
and, more significantly, to gloss the narrative in ways that were
more syntonic with the self-image and desires of a young adolescent than what he recalled painfully during the hypnosis session.
Many embarrassing details relating to powerlessness and loss of
control were not available to him except under hypnosis. In particular, the happy outcome of pleasurable sexual intercourse with
the cooperative, sexually active, female alien gave way to the forced, quite humiliating, taking of a sperm sample as the being
watched approvingly. This second scenario, which is obviously
more disturbing, is far more typical of male abduction experiences and, therefore, more believable.
All this suggests that, at least in Ed's case, the information recalled painstakingly under hypnosis is more reliable than the consciously recalled story, which seems to have been unconsciously
adjusted to be compatible with Ed's wishes and self-esteem. There
are other details obtained during the hypnosis session relating to
the transport to the craft, the numbers of beings (the female leader
and her "staff" rather than the single alien "woman"), the two
chambers (an O.R.-like room and the podlike briefing room)
rather than the single pod, and the great amount of information
transmitted by the alien female, which make the story obtained
during the regression more believable, or at least more consistent,
with other abduction accounts.

===================================================================
CHAPTER FOUR. "PERSONALLY, I DON'T BELIEVE IN UFOS"

Sheila N. was a forty-four-year-old social worker when she was
encouraged to contact me in the summer of 1992 by a psychiatrist
at the hospital where she had done her internship not long before.
She was seeking understanding and relief from the stress of what
she called "electrical dreams" that had begun more than eight
years earlier, following her mother's death. The psychiatrist Sheila
had been seeing for seven years encouraged her to see me, but it
was the hospital psychiatrist's knowledge of and interest in my
work that brought us together. Sheila's case illustrates some of the
issues that psychiatrists and other mental health professionals confront when working with abductees.
Sheila had been very close to her mother, and so her death and
the events surrounding the seven-day hospitalization in January
1984 that led up to it were deeply disturbing to Sheila Sheila's
mother had had a heart attack five years earlier and in 1984 was
hospitalized for an endarterectomy, a surgical procedure aimed at
clearing coronary artery blood flow. She did well at first, but then
suffered a cerebral hemorrhage that led to her death several days
later. Sheila was unable to find out what the relationship was between the surgery and its fatal complications, and felt that the
doctors were abrupt and uncaring toward her mother. She also felt
that her mother was unnecessarily maintained on life support after
there was no hope and that thus she was robbed of her dignity.
This insensitive treatment was especially troubling to Sheila in
view of the history of incest between her mother and her mother's
father. In Sheila's words, her mother had been "robbed of dignity
in her childhood because of her father's sexual demands." Sheila
was also angry and sad that her mother's grave was still open
with the cover to the vault left exposed and only covered with
earth three days after she was buried. Following her mother's
death a division developed between Sheila and her husband, who
she felt was unable to support her adequately in her grief. "Jim
can't deal with illness. He has to be happy," she said.
In the days after her mother 's funeral Sheila was in great pain.
She would walk the streets at night, feeling very irritable, as if
"nothing could hurt you any worse," but unable to cry. Sheila
wrote in her journal on February 9, four weeks after her mother's
surgery, of activity in the night sky-"more planes than cars." She
also began to have recurring dreams in which she would experience terror, be unable to move, and her body would feel as if it
were vibrating or "full of electricity." At first she called these
"spiritual dreams," and they made her feel like someone or something else were controlling her body, as if she were "possessed"
by demons. Later she thought of the dreams as seizures. "At this
time [just before we met] I describe them as if electricity is traveling throughout my whole body. Regardless of the name, the experience of these dreams has not changed." Ordinary dreams,
according to Sheila, are "more fragmented," whereas in a dream
in which she saw alien beings, there seemed to be "a natural progression in a certain direction."
One of the dreams, which Sheila believes occurred in March
1984, about ten weeks after her mother's death, was different
from the others with respect to certain remembered details. In anticipation of our first meeting she wrote me about it.
I woke up to a very loud noise with flashing lights. The
noise was a high pi\ch sound and remained at that tone for the
duration. I was struck by the precision of the red flashing lights.
Other bedroom doors and the bathroom door were open. I could
see down the length of the hall and it appeared that the lights
were coming through the windows on all sides of the house at
the same time.
At this point in time I was lying on my back. I was very
frightened. I eventually raised myself up on my elbows. I saw
several, small, peoplelike things walking down the right side of
the hall, one behind the other. They looked like their whole
bodies were silver in color. I noticed some blue on the first one
in line below his right shoulder. It appeared to be a reflection
of something, although there is nothing blue in the hall. They
were short with thin arms and legs. As they approached the
bemoom, the third or fourth one in the line raised his right hand
up. I knew they were coming to me, but I had never seen them
before. They appeared to be waddling [later this proved to be
an artifact of the flashing light pattern]. They were very awkward on their feet [also related to the flashing lights].
By October 1984, nine months after her mother's death, Sheila's
estrangement from her husband had reached the point where she
felt she had to move to a separate room. "I attempted on several
occasions to discuss the basis of my sadness with my husband. He
would not listen." She also did not feel she could tell him of her
strange dreams and moved out of the bedroom in part to "protect"
him and "allow him to sleep." He did not protest when Sheila
moved out, and they did not sleep in the same room until quite recently.
Shortly after this Sheila asked the pastor of her Methodist
church for a referral for psychotherapy, but difficulties arose when
the therapist insisted, against her wishes, on talking to the pastor
about her. Frustrated with the lack of progress in her weekly appointments and feeling unable to trust her therapist, Sheila's despair deepened.
In July 1985 she learned that the pastor, whom she felt close to,
was told by his doctors that his life expectancy was three to five
years due to cancer diagnosed four months previously. In addition
to the loss of her mother and the pastor's fatal illness, since November 1983 Sheila had also experienced the deaths of other close
friends and family members. Refusing to honor Sheila's requests,
her therapist still insisted upon talking with the pastor and her
husband of her work with him. Feeling desperately bereft and
alone, on July 1 7, 1985, Sheila bought a bottle of aspirin and ingested twenty tablets with "every intention of taking them all."
Except for general physical discomfort and buzzing in her ears
she suffered no untoward effects. Shortly before I first saw her,
Sheila wrote to me that "Suicide is not my typical coping style"
and "I want to reassure you it is not my intent to give up under
,any circumstance."
Soon after this episode Sheila began to see a psychiatrist, Dr.
William Waterman. Although she seemed to have resolved her
grief over her mother's death, Sheila still felt no closer to understanding or obtaining relief from the electrical dreams, which continued to plague her. A particularly disturbing one occurred onNew Year 's Eve of 1989. She had been sleeping downstairs, while
her daughter, Beverly, and Jim were in their rooms upstairs. As in
1984 she heard a loud noise and sat up with her body feeling "full
of electricity ... Something forced me down," but she did not recall seeing "the small peoplelike things" again. Six months after
the New Year's Eve episode Sheila wrote to Dr. Waterman, "Prior
to January 1, 1990, I thought all of those 'whatevers' entering my
bedroom were only symbols in a dream. Since that time, I have
come to recognize the hostility and aggression I experienced with
it as a connection to the recurring 'spiritual dreams. ' In my dream,
those 'whatevers' meant business, and so do I."
An article that Sheila saw in her local newspaper in 1985,
which she later retrieved, described UFO sightings in the town
where her mother was buried. As she wrote to Dr. R., one of the
doctors she saw later for hypnotherapy, ''This article made me
question any involvement my mother had to do with all of this."
Later she would piece together the sightings with what she had
heard, read, or seen about abduction experiences and began to
question if, indeed, her electrical dreams were dreams at all and
whether it was really true that her continuing fear of the night was
related to delayed grief over her mother's death. bn July 14,
1990, Sheila wrote to Dr. Waterman, "I told you long ago that it
is my firm belief that these dreams go far beyond loss, but I simply had nothing more to add to that."
Determined "to conquer my fear of the night whatever it takes"
and wanting desperately to "put an end to these dreams," Sheila
and Dr. Waterman explored other approaches, especially ways of
uncovering buried memories. They considered and rejected the
possibility of an Amytal interview. Finally, and with reluctance on
Sheila's part, in the summer of 1990 at Dr. Waterman's recommendation she contacted a psychiatrist, Dr. G., at a Boston teaching hospital, who specialized in the therapeutic use of hypnosis, in
order to explore the source of her symptoms and to obtain relief
from her anxiety. He asked another psychiatrist, Dr. R., who had
an interest in learning more about hypnosis, to call Sheila. A careful workup of Sheila's case included, in addition to the history, a
neuropsychological evaluation of possible temporal lobe epilepsy
and an all-night sleep study. In his note referring Sheila to behav- 1ioral neurology, Dr. R. wrote that in one of Sheila's dreams, "She
is sitting on her bed and sees several little figures: the first one
stood at the foot of her bed and the second one by the door. They
walked in an awkward way and had the shape of a small humanoid body." In another dream, he continued, "She is lying down
with a blanket over her �nd saw two of these small beings standing over her."
The psychologist who did the neuropsychological evaluation
described Sheila's sleep disturbance but noted that she "denies
other current symptoms of depression." The psychologist put together a high school incident in which Sheila sustained a minor
injury on the right side of her head that led to nausea and light
sensitivity for several days with some difficulty concentrating
during the testing, "variability of attentional functioning" and
"motoric restlessness" and suggested "a possible diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder." Sheila wrote in the margin
of a copy of the report she sent me beside these words, "I will
never believe this is true of me." Noting Sheila's tension during
the examination, in addition to her history, the psychologists also
considered the possibility of an "anxiety disorder" and a posttraumatic stress disorder "given the trauma of her mother's death,
her experience of nightmares, and her exaggerated startle response." They concluded, however, "Intelligence testing found
Ms. N. to be a very bright woman functioning in the above average and superior range." An all-night sleep study found "nothing
remarkable except anxiety and poor sleep."
According to her records, between August 1990 and July 1992,
Sheila had twenty-four appointments with Dr. R. and/or Dr. G.,
which included at least seven hypnosis sessions. The appointments were generally one hour and the hypnosis ranged from fifteen to twenty-two minutes.
In a letter to me, Dr. G. wrote of Sheila's concern when he first
saw her about the vault being left open overnight and said she expressed her sadness over her mother's death and other aspects of
the history recorded here. In her journal Sheila wrote that Dr. G.
cautioned her in 1991 that although hypnosis could be of benefit
in "producing new material," it does not "guarantee accurate recall" and "can be an extension of a personal fantasy or experience." The focus of the treatment was on the impact of her
mother's surgery, death, and funeral, and on cognitive/behavioral
approaches aimed at reducing the distress of her "dreams," especially by asserting to herself they were "not reality." "I never felt
safe," Sheila said of the treatment process. In May 1992, Sheila
accepted a prescription for Klonopin, .5 mg, to combat her anxiety, and in 1 une for an antidepressant, Wellbutin, 100 mg, to be
taken at bedtime. She continued both medications until early August. In Sheila's view Dr. G. continued to connect her dreams
with depression. In his letter to me, Dr. G. stressed that hypnosismay not lead to accurate memories and also wrote that "whether
or not she is subject to delusion or deeply religious beliefs is similarly difficult to answer." He said that my willingness to accept
what people like Sheila say was "much more than neutrality," and
he argued that although my kindness, sympathy, and support toward Sheila may have led to therapeutic improvement, that "does
not necessarily confinn the theories that surround UFOs and abductions." I discussed all of these issues in a meeting with Dr. G.,
who generously agreed to schedule a Grand Rounds at his hospital
to discuss them further in a medical academic setting. During the
well-attended rounds, the issues raised by Sheila's case were discussed. Dr. G., on the basis of his research in other types of cases,
again doubted that hypnosis could lend credibility to Sheila's abduction reports. The complex questions surrounding memory and
hypnosis in abduction cases are discussed in Appendix A.
Sheila told Julia, another abductee with whom she talked at
length before I was able to see her, that under hypnosis she saw , "a skeleton with no nose or mouth," a "curling iron" with a handle and a rotating pencil tip "like a drill," a twelve-by-eighteeninch-long rectangle the color of piecrust with slits cut in rows that
created a great amount of fear in her, and she also remembered
her anns being stretched out and tied down with rubber tubing. In
notes to me in early January 1993, Sheila wrote, "I did not discuss these with Dr. G. as they occurred because I was afraid he
would reject these and I would be left feeling alone with them. I
did tell him about these collectively well after the fact. He asked me how I responded to them at the time. I told him that I immediately replaced it with a vision of a beautiful flower garden full
of hummingbirds. He commented favorably on this and I perceived his comment as encouragement to turn away from fear."
At some point during the course of the evaluation and treatment, in response to showing him the article about the UFO sighting in 1985, Sheila told me that Dr. G. said, "Personally, I don't
believe in UFOs." On two occasions when they were alone according to Sheila, Dr. R. said, "You don't really believe in Martians, do you?" She says she never used the word "Martians" and found these comments "condescending" and they undermined her
trust in him. (Dr. G. and Dr. R. say that they did not make these statements.)
Sheila wrote to me of how difficult it was for her to challenge1
"a professional" with what she felt were errors. "I wanted heir
so much, and I was always fearful of losing it," she wrote, "ever.
when I recognized I wasn't really being helped at all." On
July 31, 1992, she wrote to both psychiatrists terminating her
work with them. She says she would have preferred to speak
with each in person but "we were having difficulty scheduling
time when I assumed full employment." Both letters, which she
has given me copies of, are appreciative, courteous, and frank.
To Dr. G. she wrote of "moments where I have felt a lack of understanding and acceptance ... Over time," she stated, "I have
come to think that there is a relationship between the single
dream and those that reoccur. I desperately wanted to believe
otherwise. It simply does not make sense in the world as I know
it to be. It is my feeling that a clearer understanding of this relationship is the only way I can experience freedom from it all."
She also noted a paradox in relation to the dream of March 1984
and asked, "Why did I fall asleep when every other terrifying
dream wakes me up? Why was the setting of it in my bedroom
when that is where I was when I had thi s dream?'' And, finally,
the ultimate question, "Was it a real experience and, if so, what
happened that is so painful for me to remember?"
In her letter to Dr. R. she thanked him for . the feeling of security that his presence during the hypnosis sessions had given her,
and then explored further than in the letter to Dr. G. the sense of
actuality she had of the beings in her room in the 1984 episode
and the seemingly purposeful pattern of their deployment about
the room. She also echoed the experience of so many abductees
when she wrote, "What a horrible and terrifying thought that you
can't protect your own child [in reference to her suspicion that
Beverly has had abduction experiences as well] in the privacy of
your own home." In saying "Good-by" Sheila concluded, "I do
think that our work really ended the day Dr. G. said, 'Personally,
I don't believe ... ' I know what I saw, and I can only say that
this experience changed my life . . . One of the first questions
Dr. G. asked me," she continued, "was if I thought I have a creative imagination. It took me eight years to get this far, so I guess
my answer is 'NO' ... I will figure this out," she ended, "or die
trying." In replying thoughtfully to her letter Dr. G. wished Sheila
well and urged her to forget the most disturbing dreams as best
she could and to take a mild tranquilizer so that she could gain
"some respite" from her distress.
Shortly after she wrote these letters Sheila spoke with Dr. T.,
the psychiatrist and friend who encouraged her to contact me. In
May she had taped the CBS miniseries on abductions, Intruders.
Although she had been unable to watch it herself, she brought the
tape with her to the meeting with Dr. T., which was supposed tobe about a project which was an extension of her master's thesis.
Putting aside the discussion they had planned, Sheila declared that
she had another agenda, namely to connect, possibly by writing a
book, her abduction-related experiences with health care professionals to the question of patient satisfaction. She told Dr. T. about I her experiences and her struggle to get help in dealing with them I and gave him the tape of the miniseries which he much appreciated. Of the March 1984 experience she told him, there was a
"possibility that it wasn't a dream anymore." On August 12,
Dr. T. and Sheila met again, by which time he had compared
Sheila's story and the Intruders cases. He told Sheila, "Writing
the book is one way, but this is another way." And he gave her
my name and phone number. The next day she called my office.
I was unable to see Sheila for several weeks and asked Julia to
speak with her. They met on August 27, and Sheila found their
conversation greatly comforting; she said it helped her confmn the
possibility of a relationship between the electrical dreams and the
March 1984 experience. Sheila said that the night before their
meeting, Beverly reported she had awoken about five o'clock in
the morning "incredibly scared," with an unexplained green light
shining into her bedroom through a large window fan, creating a
flashing effect and illuminating the wall opposite her bed. The
meeting with Julia was the first time Sheila felt that someone had
heard and understood her.
On September 1, Julia told me that Sheila had called her to tell
her that the night before she had had another electrical dream in
which she had been paralyzed with great pain in her hip where
she felt a needle had been inserted into the bone. She felt intense
fear and desperation and I agreed to meet with her as soon as my
schedule permitted. We talked at length on the phone a few days
later, and our first meeting-a four-hour session which consisted
of a review of Sheila's history and a long hypnosis session-was
scheduled for September 21.
Sheila grew up in a small city west of Boston. She is the middle of five children. "My family of origin is close," she wrote in
one of her communications to me. Her father was a commercial
airline pilot who was away a great deal when Sheila was young.
Although retired, he still travels a lot, mainly now between Maine
and Florida. He does not admit to seeing a UFO, Sheila said, "but
he wouldn't believe them either." "My mother never missed an
opportunity to instruct us on proper etiquette in our youth," Sheila
wrote me after reviewing the first draft of my write-up of her
case. "She was a true lady and always strived to set a good exam-
pie for us." In Sheila's view, her mother "protected us a lot" when
the children were growing up, which may be related to the history
of incest.
As a small child Sheila attended the Presbyterian church, then
went to the Congregational church, and in high school began going with friends to the Methodist church, where she became close
to the pastor who first referred her for counseling after her mother's death. She attended Sunday school as a child, and the Bible
became important to her. Beverly now attends a Christian school.
Sheila always viewed God as a "source of energy," but her abduction experiences, or, more accurately, the way these experiences
complicated the grieving process after her mother's death, challenged her faith. According to the Bible, she told me shortly before her first regression, "you should love God more than your
parents. I was angry with myself because that wasn't how I was
feeling."
As a child and adolescent Sheila was musically and athletically
inclined and socially active. "I like to be with people," she said.
She met her husband, Jim, who is now a school teacher, when she
was a sophomore in high school and he was in · college. After college Jim enlisted in the army for three years and encouraged
Sheila to date other men, which she did, "but my heart wasn't in
it." She actively pursued Jim, writing to him every day while he
was in the army. "He tried to pawn me off on his brother," but "I
just hung in there." Rather self-disparagingly she says that after
Jim came out of the anny "all his friends from high school and
college were scattered so I was the only one left." They were married in 1970 and Beverly was born in 1975. Sheila says that the
marriage was good until after her mother 's death and the electrical
dreams began. Sheila attended college and social work school at
Massachusetts institutions, initially obtaining her license in 1980.
With characteristic persistence, when circumstances permitted,
Sheila returned to graduate school and finished in 1991. At the
time of our first meeting she was working in the adult psychiatry
unit of a general hospital west of Boston.
The .first recollection Sheila has of experiences that might be
related to the abduction phenomenon is an incident that occurred
before she was six. She and her brother saw something during the
night they called the "Gaw." Sheila wrote me later that ''The
'Gaw' without a doubt had the same appearance as the beings that
entered my bedroom" [in 1984]. Another incident occurred between ages six and eight. "I saw someone walk out of the closet"
in her bedroom, she said. She screamed and her parents came in,checked the room, and reassured her that she had had a bad
dream, but "I guess I had my reservations ... I felt it was real."
The being was quite tall and shadowy in appearance. It walked toward her window and disappeared. To this day Sheila keeps her
closet door closed. Even before our first regression Sheila associated this being with the entities she saw in her room in 1984. "It
was the same as coming into the bedroom eight years ago."
When she was in her early teens, Sheila was driving in a car
with her mother and one or two of her siblings while the other
children and her father were in a second car (with five children
they had to take two cars) on a visit to her paternal grandparents.
Each person in the car that Sheila was in saw a bright light which
looked like a bolt of lightning but was straight, just above and
parallel to the horizon. "It was just one of those things you
couldn't explain." Before she began therapy in November 1984,
Sheila shared her March 1984 experience with her sister Melissa.
Melissa took it seriously, gave Sheila a hug, asked for details, and
told Sheila of her own related experiences. But until 1989·, Sheila
still dismissed the possibility that it could be real. As she pointed
out, "It's no wonder that those who have not experienced it have
so much trouble accepting."
What Melissa told Sheila was of an incident when she was
seven or eight and Sheila was thirteen or fourteen, and she saw
"something big and silver in the sky" that so disturbed her she
was shaking and crying. When she told her father, he dismissed
her with, "It's just a blimp. Don't worry about it." Melissa continued as an adult to be troubled by this memory and sought help
from a hypnotherapist, but whenever she would get close to bringing up the experience, she would start to shake and cry again. Melissa, to whom Sheila feels very close ("she's wonderful"), has
told Sheila that under hypnosis she has seen different colored reflections in association with the object, blue on one occasion and
"orangy-pink" on another, but because of her terror the hypnosis
has not been productive.
When Melissa was in her early twenties she saw a ball of light
come through the sliding doors of her apartment, "bounce around
the room," go down the hall and into another room and "through
a wall." She was with a friend, and they both ignored the phenomenon until Melissa said, "Wait a minute, the curtains are
closed. It's not a light from a car going down the street." As
Sheila related, "They followed the light around the room before it
went back outside through the same sliding doors."
When Sheila told a cousin of her father's about coming to see
me, the cousin told her that she had seen a UFO in her neighbor's
backyard and that Sheila's older sister, Laura, had had an experience "with a loud noise and red lights" resembling Sheila's. But
Sheila and Laura are quite different and Laura - never told her of
this incident.
Sheila's daughter Beverly's possible involvement in the abduction phenomenon is an important element in Sheila's determination to explore her experiences. She, like many abductees who are
parents, is deeply troubled that she cannot protect her child. When
Beverly was fourteen or fifteen ·months old and still sleeping in
her crib, Sheila remembers waking in the middle of the night and
going downstairs in the dark, which was very unusual for her. She
saw "something white across the stair'' and wondered what she
might have left there. When she turned on the light she saw it was
Beverly, sound asleep in her pajamas without a blanket. When
Beverly was about eight Sheila took her to the pediatrician for a
possible ear infection. The doctor removed an object about the
size of a pencil eraser with "junk all over it" and discarded it.
Beverly insisted, weeping, that she had not put the object in her
ear, yet she told Sheila that as far back as she can remember she
covers this ear with her sheet and blanket to keep it from being
exposed. As is characteristic of child abductees, Beverly had frequent unexplained nosebleeds when she was little.
Sheila and I met on September 21, October 12, and November
23 for hypnotic regressions. Dr. Waterman was present during the
second and third sessions. As I had not seen her before, half of
our first meeting was given over to filling in details of Sheila's
family background, personal history, and the experiences she and
her family had undergone that might be related to abduction experiences. Initially she appeared to be a rather timid, anxious, and
soft-spoken woman who was clearly determined to forge through
considerable distress to meet with me. Her anxiety, I later discovered, was increased by the troubling elements of her previous experiences with doctors. Her concern with control and the fear of
losing it were evident from the outset.
Before beginning the first regression, whose objective was the
recovery of material related to the March 1984 experience, Sheila
and I reviewed her conscious memories of the episode and I asked
her to draw the layout of the rooms and sleeping arrangements in
her house. Just before the start of the regression Sheila was talking wit,h me about the changes in religious faith and feelings of
isolation she had been experiencing. In the hypnosis sessions
Sheila spoke 'very softly, while her body movements reflected in-
tense energies that corresponded to the "tremendous" pressures
and other forces she was experiencing. Before the second session
I asked Pam Kasey to take notes describing these movements and
will report them in that respect.
Under hypnosis Sheila immediately spoke in a very soft tone of
feeling scared of "the noise and the lights." I took her back to an
earlier point in the night and asked her to describe the process of
going to bed. She said that she had gone to bed about eleven
o'clock, after her husband, and tried unsuccessfully to get him to
give her a hug (they were still sleeping in the same bed at that
time). She believes that she went to sleep lying on her left side,
but the next thing she actually recalls was being awake on her
back, hearing a very loud, high-pitched ·noise-" I can't scream
louder than that noise"-and seeing an evenly blinking red light
"coming in all the windows all over the place ... Jim looked like
he was dead," she said. "His mouth was open and the lights made
him look like a funny color." She became so frightened at this
point that I had to reassure Sheila that the beings would not come
into the room we were working in. Later she wrote me, ''The
greatest benefit in this was that I was certain that I was not alone.
I knew you were there."
Feeling confused, Sheila pushed herself up on her elbows and
saw several of "those things" coming down the hall. One of them
raised his hand as if to signal to others. With her breath coming
in gasps, and with much encouragement on my part to breathe
deeply and to recenter herself, Sheila described,three figures with
"skinny arms and legs" that came in a straight line into her room.
Two of them came to the end of her bed and the blinking lights ;and noise ceased as the beings at the bottom of her bed stared at
her, "just looking." Her fear mounting, Sheila told me that she
wanted to lie down again so the beings would not see her, but realized this was to no avail. "I know they' re going to come to me.
I feel that," she said. Two of the beings came beside her and one
stood over Jim. She looked at their eyes and saw "power'' but
could not speak of this further.
Part of her terror, Sheila then realized, was that she had seen
the beings before ("I know them"), and "I don't want to see
them." Her fear seemed to reach a crescendo as her body writhed
in awful contortions and her limbs twisted about, tensing and relaxing. Their eyes are "so ugly," she said, and reported that she
feared the beings' touch. Thrashing and turning, Sheila now saw
a white light above her and felt her arms being held to her sides.
''This is not my bedroom," she announced, and moaned, "I
want to go home. I don't know how I got here." There were now
a lot of beings "coming and going. It's hard to count them because they're all over." Sheila felt she had been forced to "lie
down" and said that the beings "took my energy ... There is
power in those eyes," she declared. Something touched her on the
abdomen and "they won't let my arms go. They always do that."
Then she felt the "horrible pressure" and pain of "something
square" pressing into her body through the lower abdominal wall.
''The scary part is you' re not in control," she says. Sheila did her
best with my help to overcome her generally ladylike ways and to
express the rage and humiliation she was obviously feeling. But
all she could do was say she would like to kick the beings, tie
them up, and "send them home." She described their "funnyshaped" and hairless "fat heads," and pronounced, "They don't
look like us."
The scariest thing about the beings is the eyes, Sheila said.
''They're so big ... They're different." Tiring now, giggling and
punning weakly, she said, "Maybe they're from God, with big
temples !" Toward the end of the regression I asked Sheila to describe where she was. "It doesn't look like my bedroom," she
said. "I feel like I'm on a table," which "feels hard." Her body
"feels hot" from the "fighting" and "trying to get away." She returned to "the power of the eyes," especially of the one she called
" 'the leader' ... He controls with his eyes. Everyone respects
him." The experience of ''just their eyes and my eyes" was like
· "neurolinguistic programming," Sheila added. They "take control
and then you don't have the energy to fight." Before stopping I
asked her to give her perspective on the reality of what she had
gone through. "I know it happened," she said somewhat sadly.
I spoke with Sheila the next day as part of my follow-up routine. She felt "confused" and "vulnerable now," for the experience
had seemed "so real." She was determined to prevent these
"dreams." I said that I did not know how to help her do that, but
might be able to assist her in coming to terms with her experiences. She agreed to "join in the mystery" with me.
Dr. Waterman had heard me lecture on the subject of abduction
experiences and was open to the possibility that Sheila's case
might be an example of this phenomenon. He cleared his schedule
to come to our next regression.
Sheila seemed more self-confident when she arrived for the
second regression. Despite her fear, her recollection of the disturbing emotions of the first session, and a feeling of "tremendous
personal violation" that "someone could enter your home and in-vade your space," she was determined, almost eager, to continue.
"I've lived with it long enough," she declared. Later Sheila wrote
me of how our first session broke her isolation, validated her experience, and bolstered her strength and determination. In the
course of reviewing what had happened during the first session
she said, "I don't care what anyone thinks; I know what I saw."
She spoke disappointedly of a friend whom she generally trusted
and had told of her abduction experiences. But the friend "doesn't
believe me," Sheila said, and lamented that "people think that we
have a discrete universe that we know about, and they don't want
to work with anything beyond those boundaries."
We reviewed the first session, which she recalled quite accurately, except that the square instrument that was pressed through
her abdominal wall she now remembered as "rectangular," approximately one by two and a half inches. Typically conscientious, Sheila assured me she had not meant to "lie," but she was
so disconcerted by her pain that she could not speak clearly. She
asked for "some direction, some goal," and I suggested we explore further the March 1984 incident, picking up where we had
left off.
Once again Sheila described the bright lights, the noise, her fear
and confusion, and how frustrated she felt when she could not
wake her husband. She spoke of beings coming into the room and
to her bed and again focused on the leader's eyes. "He scares
me," she said, but "I've got to see him better." Now the eyes appeared black, not brown, and staring into them gave her the feeling that "there's this black all around me." She felt she "couldn't
breathe," "squished [unable to move]," and "covered with black ,stuff . .. I felt like I was in a black box." She had the sense that
she fell asleep for "two seconds" and "then I saw a light, just
white, on top . . . it's too bright." Then she was on the table,
"feels great" for a moment before becoming intensely afraid as
she was shown "needles ... by my eyes."
Sheila's body .movements and other behavior as described in
Pam Kasey's notes tell the story of her relived experience more
powerfully than her words. She clenched and unclenched her
hands and stretched her arms. Her legs twitched and her eyebrows
became furrowed. Her shoulders tensed and she shuddered almost
convulsively. Her breathing became labored, then quiet. Sometimes there were long silences and small restless movements.
The needles were stuck "right in my forehead." At first this
was painful, but "then I just relaxed." The needles in her head
seemed to cause her right hand and arm to become "numb." Then
the leader walked up to her with something that looked like a fan
with "a needle in it ... I tried to stop him because I'm afraid of
it," she said. Then her legs tensed up and twitched as she described his approaching them with the fanlike instrument. Her legs
were "a little bit afar [sic] apart," the left straight and the right
bent, as one of the figures stuck the fan's needle into the side of
her left leg. Sheila wanted to scream as she said, "Take it out of
me. Take it out of me," but could only moan softly, even with my
encouragement. Even after the needle was removed from her leg,
it still felt "stiff and sore."
After this she saw "a lot" of the beings "standing over me."
She was embarrassed to have no clothes on. Then there was
"something coming over me" that looked rather like an electric
shaver with "something black underneath it ... I can tell they' re
holding it," she said, as one of the beings "keeps putting it on
me" and dragged it across her abdomen from the left to right side,
causing her to feel cold. This seemed to be the black rectangle she
had spoken of before. Her body now became more tense and agitated and Sheila groaned as she told of the shaverlike instrument
being pressed "on my right side, very low, where I imagine my
right ovary or appendix is" while "they' re trying to hold my
[right] leg down." She felt intense pain as the instrument was held
here. Sheila said, "I just have to balance myself . . . It feels like
they're going to go through the other side ! ... Can you imagine
an elephant balancing on one leg?"-i.e., standing on one leg on
her abdomen. Then she had the feeling that an instrument outside
her body was "suckin' stuff out from the inside of my body."
After a few minutes Sheila's body became more still and she
pulled restlessly at her shirt as she declared, "I'm hot." She did
not "take the time to pay attention" to what was removed through
the wall of her abdomen. She was clear, however, that she "saw
the black rectangle." She spoke again of her fear, anger, and pain
and then said, "I see their eyes. I don't want to see them anymore."
At this point the scene changed and Sheila was shown something that looked like a huge, red stained-glass window with
brown and gold lattice work separating the panes that curved
vastly toward a dome; such windows lined the entire length of a
long wall. The feeling she had was, "I really am here." The coneshaped dome was so awesome in its towering depth above her
that "it scares me to look at it." At the same time, the display
seemed very beautiful, like "the northern lights ... a fountain of
pure gold." The sense of depth seemed to be created by record like
grooves that spiraled upwards. When I asked Sheila what made
this so frightening she could only say, "It's like power. I can't tell
you any more." She said, "I want to go home," and recalled nothing further. "They took my memory away," she concluded.
After coming out of the regression Sheila said she felt sad,
which she attributed at first to feeling "like I wasn't dressed" and
being so out of control. Trying to return to her ladylike manner
Sheila said, "My desodorant failed me under these circumstances.
I'm soaked." But more significantly she observed how troubling it
was to find out that "my body is not my own."
Dr. Waterman was impressed with the power and apparent authenticity of what Sheila had gone through in the session, and
over the next few weeks struggled with his shifting views of her
case so that he could be more helpful to her, "joining in the mystery" with us. In a follow-up telephone call, Sheila expressed deep
gratitude for our work, spoke of the isolation she had felt as a result of not being believed, and expressed her determination "to
force a sense of accountability" in the psychiatric profession in regard to abduction experiences. She spoke of her desire to do research that would integrate her experience with caregivers in
relation to the abduction phenomenon with her interest in patient
satisfaction.
Julia and Sheila had a long telephone conversation several days ,after the regression. Sheila wanted to know that I believed her and
had many questions about hypnosis and the processes of remembering and forgetting. She wondered if there is distortion in hypnosis, and what prevented her memories from surfacing on their
own without it. She speculated that it could be fear. Julia concluded, "I was very impressed with the strength Sheila is exhibiting. This Sheila seems like a different person to me. She can
hold her own in a conversation where before she was too timid
and insecure, always holding back tears. To me this is the most
fascinating aspect of the whole abduction phenomenon, how coming to terms with what is buried in memory can affect your whole
life."
Before beginning the third hypnosis session, which was also attended by Dr. Waterman, we reviewed what had occurred during
the six weeks since the last meeting. Just three nights before at
about three o'clock in the morning, Sheila had had another dream
"like the electricity" in what she called a "semiconscious" state.
"I woke up real quick, and I could hear someone breathing funny
and I felt a hand on my side." She jumped up, screamed in terror,
turned on the light and saw no one there. Yet the pressure of what
felt like a hand on her hip and a "short click" sound that she took
for breathing seemed altogether real. Although sometimes now
she feels strong, even at night, on some nights, like the one above,
she is frightened by the sense that "there's someone in the room
with you and you can't see anybody." She is especially troubled
by the lack of control and knowing she cannot protect Beverly.
She captured the feeling of most abductees when she said,
"You' re always living with a certain amount of fear that it's going
to happen again."
After this discussion we talked about Sheila's first experience in
my support group ("people are at different levels," she accurately
observed). The experiencers are "all in the same boat," she noted,
"a boat at this point in time I can't deny." She spoke then of the
"overwhelming" impact of acknowledging her experiences, and
the difficulty of finding anything positive in them. "I don't know
if I'd want to live forever under someone else's control," she said.
She was having difficulty living with the implications of what she
was discovering in the hypnosis sessions, "just that there are
greater powers . . . how insignificant we are as human beings,"
and "that you have maybe transformed [sic] some barrier." Of the
beings themselves she wondered, "Where do they come from?"
Most disturbing to Sheila, "worse than the fan and the needle and
the tube and electric razor and the needles in my forehead, was
the blackness ... It' s a terrifying experience of the black," she
said, "looking in their eyes to figure out how they got there, and
then it gets covered with black."
Sheila had resolved to explore the experience of New Year's
Eve 1989, in which she had experienced "the electricity," and felt
that "something forced me down," but did not see the beings. Before we began the hypnosis, she recalled waking at about midnight and again at a quarter of one, hearing a noise, and feeling
"like someone had their hands on my arms and my legs. They
stretched me face down on the couch, they stretched me out. I sat
up and didn't see anything. I was scared out of my mind. I was
terrified to be alone."
In the beginning of the regression we went over the events of
that New Year's Eve. In a journal entry of January 1 2, 1990,
Sheila had written, "I have been truly frightened at night since. It
was the worst one [dream] I have had in a long time." This evening Sheila's father, her sister Melissa, and Melissa's daughter,
Kimberly, had come over to join Sheila, Jim, and Beverly. They
left about eleven and Sheila went to bed at eleven-thirty, "because
I was tired." Beverly had just persuaded Sheila to switch bed-rooms, as Sheila's was larger and had a telephone. Explaining that
she did not have the time to prepare Beverly's former room for
her own sleeping, Sheila decided to sleep downstairs on a long
sofa in the sunroom. She took a pillow from upstairs and covered
herself with an afghan, feeling sad as she thought about her mother's not being there.
Sheila wrote in her journal that as she prepared to go to sleep,
"I was scared out of my mind. I was terrified to be alone." The
sunroom, which is off to the side of the house, was "so far away
from Jim and Beverly." She recalled the humming sound of the
humidifier and hearing the swinging of the pendulum of a downstairs clock. She believes that despite her fear she was able to fall
asleep. She was awakened about midnight-the clock on the VCR
said 1 2:02, according to her notes of January 1 2, 1990-and
frightened by "fireworks" that seemed to be coming from across
the street where the people "have company. They're entertaining
tonight." Then she was frightened by a light that came into the
room, and said, "It's too bright." Then the light is "gone," and
Sheila said, "I got to watch for that light." She was still awake
when a clock struck twelve-thirty.
I took her back to when she looked at the VCR clock and asked
her what she did next. She said that she stood by the window and
looked out at a light on a pole in her neighbor's driveway and attributed the light in her room to this source. Then, despite fear of
such intensity it caused her to shake, she recalled lying down
again on the couch to escape her fear. She remembered looking at
the large organ in the living room nearby and seeing plants in the
room. Her fear was mounting at this point, both in the experience
that she was recalling and in the session itself. Lying on her left
side Sheila tried to close her eyes. Despite her terror, Sheila said
she was able to fall asleep. "It took a little while. I was very
tired."
· Stressing again how alone she felt so far away from Jim and
Beverly, Sheila said, "I saw that light again. I tried to find it." It
seemed to come from the side of the house. "It's real bright. Then
I looked at it; then it was real black." She was afraid of the light
and asked how to make it go away. Then, in the light, she saw
something orange and pink with a "dark spot on it." Now on her
back instead of her side she experienced a light so bright that she
asked me, "Did you just flash a light?" Next she was in the middle of "gray and stuff all around me that is like mist." In her journal entry of January 1 2, 1990, Sheila had written "gray and
V-shaped ... I couldn't see them." The entry continues, "But
there were two of them at each point-my neck, each upper arm,
and about 6" above my ankles-five sets of two in all. The only
way I can describe them is that they hurt me and these 2 sets were
perfectly symmetric-any other way I could feel them even after
I woke up. They seemed so real." Her breathing was labored and
gasping now and she felt as if she were standing but would like
to lie down. She spoke of feeling "not cold," as if she were in
"some kind of gray bubble that was room temperature" with "no
defined walls or a flat ceiling."
Then Sheila said bluntly, "I just saw their eyes. I want to get
away from them. They' re right in front of me."
"Where?" I asked.
"By the gray stuff." A great struggle now ensued in which
Sheila was drawn to look at the eyes, but also avoided them and
wanted to make them "go away." She noted how "big" and "intense" the eyes were, and "I never see them blink." Compelled to
look into them she acknowledged, "I see the eyes." Although this
admission, or the act of looking into the eyes, or both, made her
feel more relaxed, Sheila felt at the same time that this made
her "feel like I could be crazy, like you don't know what you're
doing, like you could be like psychotic or something, like you're
not in touch with reality."
Virtually whimpering now, Sheila described the terror of giving
up control. "They' re in control," she said. "I have to surrender it."
She felt "exploited" by them, but at the same time "that we depend on each other." Her thoughts returned to the "too bright"
flashing light which terrified her. Then Sheila saw something "orange" outside the window, "very low to the ground." With enormous difficulty, despite much encouragement on my part, she was
able to say only "I saw a big, orange, oval mass."
Sheila asked "to go back to the eyes and talk about depending
on them ... They just told me that," she said after she surrendered control. Acknowledging that neither she nor I really understood what it meant, Sheila said, "we're both depending on each
other. I have to accept his [the being's] presence in my life," or
at least that he "comes to me in the nighttime." She does not believe he would "come to me in the daytime." When I asked her
how this information was communicated to her she said, "I just
know. I know what he's thinking. He communicates, but he can't
tell you how." She was not happy with all this-"I don't like him
there"-but accepts the truth of what she has acknowledged.
Sheila had considerable difficulty steadying herself to sit up after the hypnosis was terminated. She connected the eyes clearlywith the blackness she had experienced in the previous regressions. "The eyes are scary. Well, I was looking at their eyes and
then I was surrounded with black. All I could see was black."
This time she did not feel surrounded with blackness when she
looked into the eyes; she even found that she relaxed, but found
the idea that "we depend on each other" frightening because "they
are not friendly. You wouldn't invite them over for the holidays."
She wondered if they were "deceptive ... You can't depend on
someone who's deceptive. You can't rely on them." But she was
not sure about this.
We talked together about how interdependence occurs when
you surrender control. "When I looked in their eyes-we talked
about depending on each other-and I started thinking about
systems theory, you know, ecology. But now that I'm awake I
think that, well it's very difficult to think they' re around ... I
think they' re around in the daytime even though I don't see
them." Sheila struggled further with the problem of control. "I
don't see the balance, like when you look in their eyes, and then
they' re in control and you surrender the control then that's when
you depend on each other. But I don't see the balance in logical
thinking." We talked further about the human desire "to be in control" and the destructive consequences of this. "You have to surrender to achieve balance," she said. Human beings have been
"socialized to be in control" in the daytime. ''That's the daytime
control," she added. "Nighttime you surrender for that perfect balance." We ended on the question of whether the nighttime surrender of control could have any payoff for the day. "I think it
could," Sheila said.
"How?" I asked.
"Well, that's what I don't know the answer to," she said.
Dr. Waterman was impressed with what happened in this session and the days that followed. Sheila continued to integrate what
had come up in this session, especially in their meetings. Troubling details returned that she had actually set down in her journal
on January 1 2, 1990, but which had not come up in our session,
especially concerning the V -shaped points. Still, Sheila seemed to
Dr. Waterman to be a "different person," smiling, worried for him
(his father had recently die.d), and much more self-assured. Later
she wrote me that she was impressed with major changes in his
outlook, "shifting views-Something was different." I saw her at
the support group on December 14, three weeks after the last session. She seemed more energetic, with a bright, direct look in her
eyes, and said she felt more hopeful. We talked about her efforts
to help another abductee who was struggling with feelings of
hopelessness in the dawning realization of her experience, just as
Sheila had done.

DISCUSSION
It is difficult for us to admit when we do not know something. In
psychiatry there is a tendency, natural enough perhaps, to try to fit
psychological data or emotional phenomena into familiar categories. Total uncertainty is very uncomfortable. In Sheila's case the
emergence of her "electrical dreams" and other features of a traumatic condition following her mother's death created a certain
logic that argued for an explanation of her case on the basis of unresolved grief, depression, or a post-traumatic stress disorder related to the death of her mother, to whom she had in fact been
close. Yet various therapeutic efforts that followed this direction
failed to relieve Sheila's distress, and by the end of the summer
of 1992 she had become increasingly desperate.
In retrospect there were several features of Sheila's case that do
not fit the diagnosis of delayed grief reaction or depression alone.
Although anxious about the intrusive and disturbing electrical
dreams, her principal symptom, there was nothing in them that
pointed to a preoccupation with loss, separation, or other characteristics of grief, nor was there the deep loss of self -esteem nor
the self-reproach that is likely to accompany clinical depression.
Even the impulsive suicide gesture in July 1985 was in response
to a genuine problem of confidence in a therapist at a time when
she was feeling particularly desperate and alone.
Sheila did in fact show features of a post-traumatic stress condition with general anxiety, troubling dreams, and difficulty sleeping. But the question to be answered concerns its source .. The
death of her mother was troubling to Sheila, as was the estrangement from her husband. There was little, however, in her reaction
to these events-to which she seemed to have adapted reasonably
well-Qr the content of her dreams to suggest that they were the
principal source of her ongoing traumatized state. A neuropsychological evaluation early in 1991 documented Sheila's anxiety but
did not show evidence of depression and described her as "functioning in the above average to superior range." No other cause of
her trauma, aside from the abduction experiences, has been uncovered.
Sheila's case demonstrates typical features of the abduction
phenomenon. These include frightening dreams that seem morereal than ordinary nightmares� memories-some available consciously with others emerging under hypnosis-of intrusion into "her bedroom by humanoid beings� and being taken into a strange 11enclosure and subjected to intrusive surgical-like procedures. In
three hypnosis sessions we were only able to scratch the surface
of what Sheila seems to have undergone. Yet joining her in exploring the ntystery of these experiences� and giving her the opportunity to express the powerful repressed affects that are
associated with them, has been therapeutically effective. In addition, Sheila says that her relationship with her husband has improved considerably.
One could argue that Sheila's clinical improvement was the
result of confirming a set of false beliefs or delusions. But there
is nothing in Sheila's tough-mindedness to indicate a proneness to
delusional thinking, or even suggestibility. Furthermore, psychotic
individuals with delusions do not generally improve when their
delusions are reinforced, as too much psychological energy must
be invested in the belief system at the cost of other functioning.
We might also consider the benefit that accrues when one becomes part of a community of belief� as in certain religious
groups, but the abduction phenomenon runs counter to contemporary social belief� and Sheila, like almost all abductees� finds the
idea that these intrusions, whatever their source, exist in reality, to
be altogether unwelcome. If anything, she is additionally traumatized by her acknowledgment of the actuality of the abduction experiences. Finally, there is the witnessing of Dr. Waterman, who
was initially a skeptic about abduction experiences but open to
working with me. Having known Sheila for more than seven
years he saw her responses under hypnosis as authentic reflecting
powerful traumatic experiences with no apparent source other than
what Sheila reported. during the sessions.
The abduction phenomenon runs counter to the notions of reality of the Western scientific worldview. We believe it is simply
not possible for these events to be taking place. Yet we have, so
far, no conventional explanation for what individuals like Sheila
are experiencing. Sheila herself wrote of her case to Dr. G. "It
simply does not make sense in the world as I know it to be." But
as Freud once said theory does not prevent facts from showing
up. All that those of us in the mental health professions can ask
of ourselves at this time is that we keep our minds open when
dealing with phenomena like the alien abduction syndrome that
we do not understand, and resist providing explanations prematurely. We would do well to follow Sheila's lead, as she wrote to
Dr. Waterman in 1990, "I have left my DSM III-R behind." Listening without knowing, but with a willingness to explore, can in
itself be helpful.
Although Sheila has had more difficulty than many abductees
in recovering the material from her experiences and moving
through their traumatic content, she shows the beginnings of a
transformational process that has become familiar to me. In association with her own surrender of control, she is beginning to recognize the negative consequences for herself as an individual, and
for the ecological balance of the planet, that our struggle for dominance and control has brought about. We do not know whether
this shift of consciousness is simply a by-product of her working
through the traumatic experiences or is intrinsic to the abduction
phenomenon itself. It is interesting in this regard that Sheila's experience of acknowledging her interdependence with the alien beings, followed by her concern for the earth's ecology, occurred
when she felt she had to look into the alien leader's eyes and surrender control.
The alien abduction phenomenon is a potentially rich source of
information for our understanding of ourselves and the surrounding universe in which we participate. But to make such knowledge available we need first to admit our great ignorance of nature
and nature's secrets. As Sheila wrote to Dr. R., "Some day, you
may hear someone else telling you about a similar experience. I
do not have a 'scientific ' explanation for this either, but that does
not call for an ignorant stance. We can admit that psychiatry does
not have all the answers to understanding mental disorders, so
why should we believe that science is prepared to explain everything that happens in this world?"

CHAPTER FIVE. SUMMER OF '92

Scott was twenty-four when we first met in November 1991 after
he expressed interest in joining my monthly abductee support
group. He was seeing a psychotherapist at the time because of
anxieties related to his abduction experiences, and she thought the
group could be helpful in giving him the opportunity to meet
other abduction experiencers and in allowing him to share the
conflicts that had grown out of his encounters. My policy then
and now has been to meet personally with abductees before including them in the group. Scott's case demonstrates the dramatic
personal transformations that are possible when an abductee directly confronts the reality of his abduction experiences and the
powerful emotions associated with them. Scott also is one of an
enlarging group of abductees who discover an apparent dual
human/alien identity in the course of their exploratory work.
Scott is a tall, husky, forthright ·young man whose slightly breezy manner belies his underlying thoughtfulness and sensitivity, qualities which have expanded in the time that I have known
him. Although Scott has resisted formal education, he reflects a
strong, untutored intelligence. Scott works as an actor and filmmaker and with his father in his auto mechanic business and is a
talented builder, capable of repairing pianos as well as cars. He
has played the piano since childhood and is an aspiring songwriter. He also wanted to be a pilot, but "all the medical stuff' he
was put through as a result of his abduction experiences made this
difficult. "I 've always kept busy," Scott says, "to keep my mind
off what's been 'happening to me.' "
In the summer of 1992 Scott went through a period in which
his customary vigilant, animali stic, and fear-laden defensiveness
(calling himself a "security freak," and fearing each night that he
would be abducted, Scott hardwired the house where he lives
alone with a radio alarm he activated at night, mounted surveillance cameras in several locations as a "deterrent," and a microphone by the front door with a speaker next to his bed for night
monitoring) gave way for a time to more intense feelings of vulnerability, helplessness, and separateness from his family. "I felt
completely open to anybody to strike me down, or do whatever
they wanted to." Instead of the controlled person he had been,
Scott discovered that "the uncontrolled person was the 'real'
thing ... I was scared," he said. "I mean I felt I could be destroyed. I did not feel safe, at all ... It was completely unpaved
ground for me." It was this opening, the surrender of control, that
paved the way to the transformation of Scott's relationship to his
abduction experiences and to profound changes in his experience
of his own consciousness and identity.
Scott's sister, Lee, nineteen months younger than he, is also an
abductee, although she has been slower to recover the material related to her experiences. For many years she clung to the possibility that her fears of sexual intimacy were related to abuse by her
father or someone else. A careful history failed to substantiate a
story of abuse that could account for her fears, while a powerful
hypnosis session that we did in November 1992 revealed a disturbing, invasive early teenage experience in which she described
being taken aboard a UFO by alien beings, a probing instrument
was inserted in -·her vagina, and some sort of tissue, perhaps an
egg, was removed. Ten days later Lee embarked on a previously
planned trip to India for several months to pursue her spiritual development, especially to study Tibetan Buddhism.
After reading my account of her brother's case, which their
mother had sent to her in India, Lee was concerned that my brief
summary of her experiences would make her appear as too much
of a victim. "I do wish to help by having my story known, to inform people." She would like to see "a more well-rounded" account "to portray a series of encounters which not only produced
physical and sexual trauma, but provided a priceless opportunity
for spiritual growth and sensitivity to all sentient beings, ranging from insects to those of other dimensions and planetary systems ... This adjustment," she continued, "would make me feelless an intergalactic rape victim and more like what I view it as
(as of yet)-an experience of something which has nearly blown
my head off with expansion of consciousness. I am strangely
grateful." Earlier on in the letter Lee had written, "Tibetan Buddhism as a philosophy recognizes much of the spiritual encounters
and 'awarenesses' abductees have had."
Scott and Lee's mother, Emily, age forty-eight, works in real
estate and supports her husband Henry's business. She may also
be an abductee, but what is most remarkable about Emily, and is
an important aspect of this case, is the extraordinary steadfastness
and support that she has given to her children. She is the only parent who comes regularly to my support group meetings, and
though she has suffered deeply over her children's abductionrelated distresses, Emily has fully accepted the reality of what her
children report they have been through. In addition, she feels a
deep, intuitive sense that the process they are undergoing is one of
personal growth and ultimate enlightenment. This attitude, whatever its ultimate truth may prove to be, is unique in my experience among the parents of abductees.
Scott's father, Henry, has been a mechanic for twenty years and
has recently started another business. Henry is cautious about talking of his feelings and views, but is also supportive of his children. He believes what they have reported, but has more of a
"show me" attitude toward UFOs and aliens. Scott has a brother,
Robert, who has reported no involvement with abduction experiences. Emily describes Robert as listening in a "detached" but
supportive manner when the subject comes up at home. Robert is
married and has three children, twin girls age three, and a baby
boy of one and a half (as of January 1993), none of whom appears to be involved in the abduction phenomenon. Scott feels
grateful for his generally positive family life, and cannot connect
his abduction experiences to
any hidden traumas pr other aspects
of it. "I look at my family, and I look at the way I've grown up,
and it doesn't coincide at all," he says.
When I first met Scott he had been coping for several months
with trauma related to an abduction experience that occurred in
April 1990 in which he reported consciously seeing small beings
("the short guys") in his room. He connected the experience with
a memory of seeing the same beings in his room and a "flying
saucer" outside when he was ten. Through UFO organizations and
a long chain of referrals, Scott finally was referred to a therapist.
She was helpful to him, and in their work, which included several
hypnosis sessions, he recovered material related to abduction ex-
periences going back to age three. Scott has regularly attended the
support group meetings since November 1991, and he and I have
kept in contact outside of the meetings. We did two hypnosis, or
relaxation, sessions in March and December 1992, which Scott
sought in order to discover and express his buried emotions more
intensely and to explore a more co-investigative, less therapeutic,
healing model.
Details of Scott's early history were obtained from medical records at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston from when
he was fourteen and evaluated for "confusional episodes previously labeled as seizures." At six months his mother reported that
he had a seizure in association with a fever, and she stated that on
his fifth birthday he had "a generalized seizure" in the absence of
a fever but accompanied by ear pain. He was not evaluated by a
physician at that time, but his doctor was called and attributed the
seizure to the "excitement" of the day. Scott now sees that time
as a "post-abduction panic attack."
The first abduction experience that Scott has recollected occurred when he was three. In the summer of 1991, with the help
of hypnosis, he and his therapist were exploring events related to
the period when he was about nine when "I jumped back to when
I was three years old playing in the dirt outside ... and all of a
sudden, boom. I turned around, I was playing with my trucks, and
they were there." Out of the comer of his eye he said he saw two
beings appearing from nowhere and then some sort of rod "put
me under." He remembers running to his mother. After being returned he was frustrated because he was unable to tell what had
happened. "I saw big ants out there," he said. Remembering this
experience so alarmed Scott ("I jumped clear off the couch") that
he discontinued the hypnosis sessions until his first regression
with me.
Beginning when he was eight, Scott was · taken repeatedly to
physicians, especially neurologists, for the evaluation and treatment of frequent throbbing headaches that had begun when he
was six, and some sort of "spells" or "seizures" that were poorly
described as attacks of "strange feelings," "spacing out," or "confusional episodes." He was initially described as "a restless eightyear-old boy." The headaches. were diagnosed as "atypical
1 migraine" and treated with mild analgesics (painkillers). An initial
electroencephalogram (EEG) during this period was read as
mildly abnormal, followed by others that were normal. But over
the next several years Scott was treated with substantial doses of
several anticonvulsant medicines that had little effect. An outpa-tient note from when he was fifteen records "visual hallucinations" from age twelve or thirteen in which Scott reported seeing
a spinning, colored triangle and "images such as a woman [ 'feminine figure,' Scott says] leaning over his bed, cars, and outdoor
scenes etc."
By the time Scott was sixteen or seventeen the seizure diagnoses in his record had given way to "psychoemotional components ," the headaches had become " 'tension' in origin," the
hallucinations were described as "paroxysmal feelings," and the
EEGs were normal. At eighteen he was described as somewhat
depressed and "listless." By nineteen the anticonvulsant medications were discontinued and the medical visits ended. Scott
resented what he later came to feel were uninformed and unnecessary medical procedures. "It's just incredible the amount of
medical bullshit," he said when I first met with him, and in the
support group nearly a year later he objected to what he called
"hit-or-miss drugging."
Except for night fears, moodiness, difficulty concentrating, and
the other symptoms that led his parents to bring him to so many
doctors to try to understand what was going on, Scott felt that his
childhood was happy and full of friends and activities.
Scott's later symptoms bear a complex but not altogether clear
relationship to his childhood abduction experiences. Scott thinks
they were "flashbacks," re-evoked memories of his earlier abductions. Emily has asked repeatedly "Where was I?" when Scott and
Lee were undergoing the abduction experiences; yet compared to
most parents of child abductees both she and Henry have been
particularly supportive.
"It's bewildering," Emily wrote me in February 1993, a week
after her own first hypnosis session with me in which the depth
of her commitment to her children was affrrmed, "that this was all
happening right under our eyes so to speak and we apparently
were not aware of it--consciously at any rate-and to recall
Scott's remarks referring to fear of seeing them in his roomflying saucer outside--dog put to sleep-running up to our
room-Henry going outside to see what was out there with his
gun. We do recall this, but [it] was at the very back of our memory until this all came up a couple of years ago when Scott said,
'Remember when I was a kid?' and we said, 'Oh yeah! ' " Later
Emily wrote that she and Henry were fearful of a robber or intruder and also thought that Scott had had a bad dream.
Scott recalls that his childhood encounters tended to occur
when he was outside with Lee, while Lee remembers a "little
gully" near the house where she and Scott played a lot and which
she has come to believe was one of the sites of their abductions.
Lee says that "we used to love it," but when she was a teenager
she stopped playing there. "I used to think about the place as a
special place." When Pam Kasey visited the family at their Massachusetts home in March 1992, Scott and his parents talked of
various UFO sightings that the extended family had experienced
over the years. Scott recalls "seeing a ship" at age eight or nine
while riding his bike and reporting it to his uncle. But an abduction experience he describes as "a biggie," which had remained
"buried" in his mind until it surfaced in a hypnosis session with
his therapist, began in his room when he was ten.
Scott reported seeing "a flying saucer outside," and then he
said he saw several beings come into the room. They put the dog
that was in the hall to sleep, "somehow with the rod . . . After
they were done with me" Scott became afraid, as "I knew they
were going upstairs to my parents' room." Scott recalls, "I ran
upstairs-this was after [the] event-and I told them what had
happened and I said there was a flying saucer outside, and my father got his gun. He was scared shitless-everybody was-got his
gun, and went outside and there was nothing but nature." Scott recalls, "When I was a kid, I was scared to death they were going
to kill my parents." The beings seemed to him "like a greater
power than your parents." Despite his fears Scott also felt that the
beings were somehow "more wisdomful than my parents," although he is not sure whether this is "them themselves" or "the
wisdom created by the whole experience." Scott describes the "telepathy" he experiences during the encounters as "a two-way
channel. They know your thoughts and you can see theirs. It's
quite traumatizing because of its unfamiliarity."
The next abduction experience that Scott has recalled relates to
a feminine figure leaning over his bed when he was twelve or
thirteen, mentioned above in an outpatient note. At about this time
Scott was referred to a psychologist to see if there was an emotional cause of his distress. But even with lengthy psychotherapy,
little progress was made toward uncovering its origin. The encounter with the woman figure, which was part of an abduction
experience, will be reported in detail in connection with his second hypnosis session with me.
Scott does not recall any further discrete abduction experiences
until April 1990 when he says he consciously saw several entities
I in his room after first sensing their presence in his mind. "Whoever these people were they were not from around here," he re-
called in his first meeting. with me. "It was the same people. I
knew it," he said, that had been present in his room when he was
ten. Alarmed by the experience, he sought help as described
above. In several hypnosis sessions with his therapist, Scott recalled that during this abduction he was terrified as a faucetlike
device was placed on his penis, "wires" or "leads" applied to his
testicles, and a sperm sample taken as he lay terrified and paralyzed on a table in a UFO.
After our initial visit and his attendance at several support
group meetings, Scott's curiosity about his abduction experiences
deepened and he wished to explore them further, because "they
had affected my life so much." Meanwhile his personal life was
becoming more complicated. When I first met him, Scott told me
of strain in his relationship with his girlfriend, a tendency of his
to "grab on" and not be able to "let go." In the January 1992 support group he said that although she had been initially, "when it
really came down to it" she "wasn't very supportive" in relation
to his abduction experiences. At about this .time Scott was given
the opportunity to share his firsthand knowledge of abduction experiences on the set at CBS in Los Angeles, where the two-part
docudrama dealing with the phenomenon, Intruders, was being
filmed for airing in May. For two weeks in February, Scott was on
the set each day, which he found highly stimulating. He made a
valuable contribution to the cast and crew's understanding of abduction experiences and became close to one of the actresses.
At our support group meeting on February 24, Scott, just back
from Los Angeles, spoke of the feeling that we are being "prepared for" something, that there was perhaps a "plan" of some
sort, that we are not in control and "somebody else" is "running
the show ... Getting through the trauma part," he said, "has
opened up the real stuff, the spiritual behind it," and he spoke further of a "bigger power" at work in his experiences. Scott recalled
that even "when it happened to me as a kid" he felt he had to
work on being "able to stay in the same room without panicking,
without fear." The April 1990 episode, he said, "was a step up in
intensity, majorly, and almost like testing, but there's definitely
that anger, God, anger just to lash out from being touched, being
under somebody else's control."
Scott spoke further in this meeting about breaking through "the
trauma stuff' and of personal growth. His abduction experiences,
he said, had made clear to him that "there's a massive amount of
information in my head that I can't even understand.'' The aliens,
he suggested, are "helping us grow so we can comprehend
them ... They're getting us trained to get us to a point where we
can deal with them." Scott elected after this meeting to undergo
his first hypnosis session with me in order to move further
through and, hopefully, beyond the traumatic dimensions of his
abduction experiences and to discover their deeper meaning for
him and for others as well.
Scott arrived at my house on March 16 with Ann, the actress
he had gotten to know in Los Angeles. Before Scott came with
Pam and me to the upstairs room where I was then doing the regressions, we chatted a bit in the living room about what the experience of playing such a role had meant for Ann, her objections
to the inaccurate and sensationalized parts of the script, and her
sensitive efforts to maintain the integrity of the role she was playing.
Before beginning the regression we talked about Scott's apprehensions and his possibly abduction-related experiences since the
April 1990 event, which we agreed would be our focus. He had
no recollections of discrete abductions, but spoke of vaguer
"cloudy kind of stuff," a blue light coming into his room one
night, unexplained needlelike marks that had appeared on his arms
several times, and how on some mornings his left sock would be
mysteriously missing from his foot. Scott spoke of fear of death
and aloneness and of his feeling like "something in a cage, an animal, being a specimen." We reviewed the details of the April
1990 experience and Scott went back briefly over a few of the
more frightening details of his previous hypnosis sessions with his
therapist. I reassured him that I would not leave him feeling caged
and alone during our session.
After the hypnotic induction Scott spoke almost immediately of
feeling "mad." We then reviewed the events of that April evening
before the abduction experience began. He had drunk a couple of
screwdrivers, played the piano, and talked generally about his life
while in the living room with his mother and father (he was still
living with his parents at the time) who were watching television.
He went up to bed a little earlier than usual-at ten o'clockfeeling tenuous and vulnerable about the course of his existence.
As he prepared for sleep and ''jumped in bed," Scott felt some
anxiety about a new film shoot that was planned for the next day.
Scott recalls reading a magazine, and before he could fall
asleep he felt that the beings were "there, in my mind." As his
fear mounted in our session, Scott spoke of the loss of mental privacy and of the familiarity of these feelings. His room had no
door, and unexplained light was coming in from the direction ofthe adjacent clothes washer/dryer room. Scott's breath was now
coming in loud, short gasps as he spoke of "six" of "them" with
"boxy" and "angular" heads that were "after me." Then he saw a
"round-tipped rod" pushing toward him, which Scott related to
how he was anesthetized. ''They know I'm aware," Scott said, and
"they put me under" so that "I couldn't move" by touching him
with a rod behind his ear. At this point a "buzzing" in his right
ear changed to a ringing sound and "I lost control of my body."
Then all Scott saw was a screen like a TV monitor that was
"fritzing." Memories of his life flashed before him, as he felt had
happened "so many times" during abductions, and he felt himself
struggling to protect his mind "so they couldn't touch it." After
this he quite literally lost consciousness, although he had been
saying "as fast as I could 'I've got to remember, I've got to remember. ' "
Next Scott reported that he was on a table in the presence of
two doctorlike figures with odd, tan- and white-tinted skin, wearing "glasses" and white coats, and several shorter beings in "army
suits." The beings had deep, black, slightly slanted eyes with gray
borders around them. "I hate them" for "taking me from my mom
when I was young," Scott said, and "for not telling me whQ they
are." "They're curious about me," and "I'm curious, but I hate
what they' ve done."
"What did they do?" I asked.
"They've used me."
The beings then placed a "faucet thing, like a suction" over
Scott's penis. This device was connected by a tube to a box at the
side of the table. At this point Scott had a kind of out-of-body experience from fear, as he looked down on himself and saw his
head on a blocklike pillow and four prongs being pressed into his
neck, high up just below the scalp, which he also felt pushing
against him. Scott believed these were like "electrodes" that were
used to manipulate and control his movements and feelings. At
this point in our session, and also at the time, he felt calm, although he is angry when he thinks back about what was done to
him.
I encouraged Scott to center himself through his breathing and
to express any feelings that were near the surface. He gave forth
a loud growling sound as he spoke of his naked terror, his sense
of violation, and his fear of bodily injury. He noticed how quickly
he tends to "build the walls" to protect himself. He saw more
light in the room now, and for the first time in the session spoke
of the "wires" that were applied to his testicles. It was these
wires, Scott observed, in combination with the suction device over
his penis that stimulated his erection and were "making it happen"
and "taking things out"-i.e., his "sperm." The whole experience,
Scott said, just seems unbelievable."
The beings communicated telepathically to Scott that they were
"making [really taking] more white stuff" for a purpose. They
were using him "as a father ... taking my whatever, my babies."
"All the stuff' they took from him was being used, Scott knows
to "make babies." Strong feelings of shame came up for Scott at
this point, and I explained that he had no reason to be ashamed
as he had been confronted by powers or energy forms against
which he was altogether powerless. "I' m mad," he said, growling
again, but "I can't fight ... They know exactly what they're
doing." Scott remarked, "That's why they cover it up. They don't
want us to remember."
I took Scott back one more time to the traumatic, shame-filled
aspect of his experience. Once again he balked at the full reliving
of his humiliation. "I don't remember. Too painful," he said, "too
emotional ... I had no choice," he allowed. "It's not my fault."
But he quickly added, "I should have been able ... "
"Nonsense," I said and reiterated what I had told him about
powers in the world beyond our control. Again Scott expressed
his anger, and I assured him that he "couldn't do a damn thing."
After this Scott reported being "dropped in bed" in his room
feeling very frightened and also angry, but had no recollection of
how he was returned. He had the sense the beings had been
"messing around with my head," leaving information of some sort
that he could not access. After coming out of the regression Scott
was struck by the power of the emotions he had experienced.
"I' ve never had those emotions before, never, never." It "felt
good," he said, to give expression through his voice and body to
such strong, bottled-up affects. The intensity of his anger bothered
Scott some. "I'm scared to death of what damage I can do," he
said. The "whole experience," he said, "when it is brought back
into the body it releases these things. We are the emotional patterns that structure things and our reaction." He also was awed by
the intensity and brilliance of the light that he had seen while on
the table. As a result of the regression he felt he had more access
in this ("normal") reality to the experiences undergone during the
abduction. Scott was also left with the feeling, as is common with
abductees, that his mind had been "electrically" manipulated or
tampered with. He was aware that there were still "walls up everywhere," 
and that there was much more inside him that he
wanted to know about.
The nine-month period between our two regressions was a time
of rapid change for Scott. He brought Ann, who was still in Boston a week after the first regression, to the March 23 support
group meeting. They updated the group on the progress of the
miniseries. During the meeting Scott reflected on an increased
preoccupation with philosophical and religious concerns, such as
"who's in control" and the possible views of God. Around that
time Scott also made several television appearances, including an
awful show on a Boston channel in which he was humiliatingly,
but not untypically, introduced as a young man who had had sex
with aliens. As the spring continued he had increasing difficulty
integrating the stimulation and stress related to his high public exposure, and had more frequent meetings with his therapist related
to this discomfort. His therapist and I discussed his case, and I referred Scott to a psychiatrist at my hospital for prescription of a
mild tranquilizer, which helped to reduce his tension. She described Scott as initially depressed, anxious, "very vulnerable,"
and confused about what had happened to him. He seemed to her
to be a traumatized person who had experienced "a different kind
of trauma," manifesting the hypervigilance and difficulty relaxing
"you see with other trauma survivors." As far as the abduction
story was concerned, "I don't know what to make of it," she said.
"Something bad clearly happened to him."
One of the effects of Scott's crisis of helplessness and vulnerability in the summer of 1992 was to rally the support of his family, especially his mother and sister, who began coming to the
support group meetings. By September he was clearly feeling better, spoke in the support group of the need for a sense of humor,
and continued to complain about the constant intrusion of the
alien presence into his mind, a kind of loss of privacy. Emily told
the group movingly of how "two of my children have been affected," and spoke of how little understanding she had had of the
"extreme terror" to which Scott had been exposed in his abduction experiences. By October he was speaking more boldly of
pushing through his fear and his struggles "to integrate" his experiences.
Scott spoke increasingly through the fall of 1992 of the spiritual
dimensions of his abduction experiences. In the November 9 support group meeting he told of how "exposure to them" had
"opened up something in me ... It's almost like you're given an
intense jump into a spiritual realm you're not even ready for-like
Yogis go through tons of work to get to a certain point." Lee, who
was about to leave for India, talked of the "hardships that people
often suffer at the hands of their spiritual teachers." The body's
instinctual, fearful reaction to the alien encounters Scott felt was
"a natural reaction" on "a species level" when confronted with
something so deep and unfamiliar. He could not "imagine anyone
reacting kindly or feeling safe," at least initially. But toward the
end of the meeting Scott asked, "What are my choices?" and told
the group, "Even though the way I think a lot of times is how
mad I am, and how upset I am, and how bad my ego's been damaged or wiped out, there's only one way to think about it if I want
to live, and that is to look or find whatever there is positive in it
which, God, is very difficult for me at this time ... But that
seems like the only thread that will keep me alive."
On December 1 6, 1992, I met with Scott at his request to review his course and, as it turned out, to plan another regression.
In that session he told me that one night about ten days before, as
part of his increasing openness to the alien presence, he asked the
beings to "show me a sign" of their actual existence. At about two
or three in the morning he experienced in a partially awake state
the feeling of "somebody touching me from behind." He became
extremely frightened, but the touching continued-"it was almost
like teasing me." The concreteness of the response to his request
alarmed Scott. "I asked for them to show me something and they
did . . . in a way," he said.
Many abductees begin to pursue a more explicit spiritual path
as they open themselves to the depth and meaning of their experiences. Scott himself, in addition to his increasing curiosity about
the spiritual dimensions of the phenomenon, had begun to meet
with an acupuncturist, and, more recently, with a shamanic healer.
He was also increasingly challenging the traditional treatment
model Scott said of some of the therapists he had seen, "I feel I
could heal, I could help them more than they could help me, and
that sounds completely arrogant, I know." His request to undertake another regression was part of Scott's desire to move beyond
the traumata of his abduction experiences to a more reciprocal,
mutually communicative, relationship with the alien beings. We
scheduled the session for five days later.
At the beginning of the session we reviewed how frightened,
needy, and vulnerable, yet also more alive, Scott had felt during
the summer. Although he had had a recent abduction experience,
we decided to do an "open-ended" regression. In recent months I
had found that the psyche's own wisdom would take the experiencer where he or she needs to go in the altered state of consciousness and that the healing, integrating, and information gathering process is better served by not "targeting" a specific
abduction experience. Before the regression Scott spoke of his
"fear of letting go" and his determination not to "hold back" in
this session.
At the start of the regression, after several thirty- to sixty second pauses, Scott spoke of feeling the presence of "one of
them" standing by a table on which he was lying on his back. He
was thirteen and said that he had never faced or even recalled
what happened to him at that age. He perceived a cylindrical tube
he estimated to be four inches in diameter that was part of a machine near a wall. The image of the tubing, which seemed to be
pointing at his chest, was disturbing and faded in and out of his
consciousness. He also had images of other "tools," like a curved
banana-shaped instrument, on another nearby table.
Soon he reported seeing a nonhuman female figure carrying a
tray with several cylinders, each containing a little baby "in glasses . . . I'm really mad," Scott said, but "I don't know what
they' re doing." The "woman," who had come quite near him (recall the "hallucination" he had at twelve or thirteen years old of
a female figure leaning over his bed), left the room and Scott realized that the aliens-probably this figure herself-had been taking his "seeds" for the purpose of making the babies he had just
been shown.
Scott realizes now that his fear prevented him from looking directly at the beings, though he had attributed this to their elusiveness. He also speculated that if he had remembered seeing the
beings during this (or these) experience(s) he might have told his
parents, which the aliens told him not to do. For he was "part of
their family," one of the beings explained.
"If I'm part of their family, why am I here?" Scott asked. I encouraged him to explore that question. He kept getting images of
an empty cylinder, about six inches in diameter and about a foot
long, with clear fluid inside. "I want to be one of them," and "I
want to be one of me," Scott said, "but I can't be both."
"Why not?" I asked.
"Then I'm never home either way."
Next Scott reported being taken down into a huge underground,
rock-walled place by one of "a bunch of" fast-moving elevators.
It was hot there, but "better than family here," for "They know
everything about me. There are no secrets." Nevertheless, "it's
scary" and "just feels weird." At this point I felt that Scott was
judging the truth of what was happening with his analytical mind
and I encouraged him just to report his raw experience, saving the
judgments for later. "I just can't believe they're here," Scott said.
"When they come for me they know everything I know." He said
it made him feel bad that they would not let him talk about these
experiences. He wondered, "Why don't they stay?" He received
no answer to this question, except that they and we "aren't ready."
He said the beings are in the process of changing themselves
physically "so they can breathe here. They don't breathe the same
as we do."
Scott revealed other problems for both of our species should the
aliens' presence be manifest on a large scale too soon. "We're not
up to their speed," he said. "They think much faster than we do,"
and "They're going to make it so they don't hurt us."
"How would their thinking faster hurt us?" I asked.
It is "confusing when they talk to us with their minds," he replied. "Too much information. Our minds are not used to such
contact-it's a sensory overload."
At this point the session took an interesting turn. Scott acknowledged that he himself had persisted in denying the existence
of the aliens, and I asked him to explore what it was exactly that
he was denying. To my surprise he replied, "denying that I am
one of them." To acknowledge the beings' existence, he said, has
meant that he would have to experience a kind of "empty" feeling, a nostalgia for another domain. "I ' ve always known," he said,
"that I was different, that I wasn't from around here." When he
was a child, Scott recalled, "I always wanted to run away. I
couldn't figure it out. I could run anywhere, but I couldn't get
there." He said he knew that the beings did not reside in our solar
system.
Scott grasped then why he had never wanted to look directly at
the beings. With some struggle he said, "My humanness doesn't
want to see this."
"What is this?" I asked.
"Them ... The human side," he continued, "cannot handle the
other side." The human being in him reacts with fear, "like an animal ... They appear to be animals, and you act like a scared animal. It's instinct." Nevertheless, he emphasized, humans must
"stop" and realize that the aliens, whom as a child he called the
"inkies" because of their large, black eyes, like ourselves, "are
alive." We need to learn that even though "we look different" and
"we think different ... we're all life."
Scott's narrative moved then into the apocalyptic vision I have
heard increasingly from abductees. Major changes in the world
are coming, he said. The aliens will only come "when it's safer."
But that will not occur until there are "less and less" of us as we
die off from disease, especially more communicable forms of
AIDS that will reach plague proportions. This material was frightening and very sad for Scott, and he also felt that he was not "allowed" to speak of it. Although he was positive in his conviction
about this, he said, "I just hope I was wrong."
At this point in the session Scott shifted to perceiving from the
alien perspective, and he saw the earth as a blue body below him.
He had chosen to come here from another planet, he said, because
it was "closest to where we' re from." He did not know the name
of that planet, but it was yellow, mostly desert, and lacking water.
Once there had been trees and water, but something having to do
with "science"-he does not know just what-"went wrong" and
his people "went underground." Scott felt "sick" inside and
sobbed as he told of how science "destroyed our planet." I asked
Scott if he had any further information about how this had come
about. But he did not, except to observe that somehow the alien
species "knew before" the destruction occurred but seems to have
been powerless to prevent it. After the regression he recalled that
the destruction had occurred because of "something they made
they couldn't stop," and that on their planet the aliens live in an
"artificial environment."
With considerable resistance Scott admitted that the intention of
the aliens was to "live here" (on Earth) but without us, unless
"humans change," in which case "we might be able to live together." Then he contrasted the ways of humans with the aliens.
Human beings "are alone" and "they don't share." In the alien
realm "nobody's in their own world" and "everybody knows everything. There are no secrets." I asked him about himself. "I'm
one of them," he said, but in his human identity he imposes limits
on his ability to love and share because of "my own ignorance."
I asked, "What else?"
"Tradition," the "whole focus of my life, my independence," he
said. Because of "fear of being hurt, of not getting what you want,
fear of not receiving" human beings have trouble opening up and
trusting that it's okay" to give and feel love.
Change has "got to start somewhere," Scott said, and I asked
him about his leadership role, to which he had referred earlier, as
a kind of intermediary between the two species. "There's gonna
be so much work," he said, and it is "gonna take a long time." I
asked if he thought there was time. "Yes. I think so," he replied.
He was getting tired, so I asked if there was anything else he
wanted to say before sitting up.
He said, "It's got to be done one way or the other."
"What's got to be done?" I asked.
"If we don't change it's going to change for us." Then he
added rather sadly, "I don't think we can live with them."
After the regression Scott felt awkward about what he had revealed. He had difficulty trusting the information he had received
because "there's nothing that reinforces it when you're growing
up." One realm "has nothing to do with the other," he said, and
we are rarely, if ever, "exposed" to the existence of the "aliens'
side." Fear simply does not exist in the "consciousness" of that
"side," and so there is greater freedom there. Yet it is difficult for
Scott and makes him sad and afraid to "acknowledge anything
about" the alien world, especially that he is part of it. For that
means "that I'm not one of us [humans]." I spoke then with Scott
about the possibility of integrating his alien and human identities,
and he recalled how that 'just didn't work when I was a kid ...
That's just not the way people live," he said. "People're just different." I told him of four or five other "double agents" I was
working with and of the possibility of their getting together as a
group, which he thought would be a good idea.
After this session Scott felt great relief, as if a huge "weight"
had been removed. He recalled that since early childhood he experienced himself as having "two personalities," and spoke of
how "crazy" that had always made him feel. He now believes that
the doubting and denying of his alien experience has been a destructive process in his life, and wonders what part telepathy plays
in the perception of the dual identity.
Before concluding Scott, Pam, and I talked further of the meaning of the perceived alien/human project. "I don't think they're
disposing of us. I think they're taking part of us," Scott said. Then
"they' ll have everything we'll have, and they' ll have everything
they have." But there are problems with the integrating of our
species, for "you and I as we are maybe won't mix."
We speculated then about the relationship of the aliens' apparent presence on our planet and the accelerating, catastrophic destruction of the earth's living environment. "It's not just
coincidence," Scott said. From the information he has received
Scott doubts that we would survive "our catastrophe" as well as
the aliens did theirs. "For them it was not the beginning of science. I mean, they were well into science before this happened,
whatever happened. It was a lot further ahead than we were ...
They had the resources" to survive. I pressed Scott to say more of
what he knew of the relationship between our two species. "It
isn't just black and white," he said, "the two sides. There's a correspondence between the two."
My last question had to do with his reluctance to look into the
eyes of the aliens. He replied that when he was experiencing the
alien perspective he felt he was viewing reality through their eyes.
But as a human "I was scared" to "because I'd be looking at myself."
"Yourself as what?" I asked.
"As one of them," he replied. I asked him to say what was so
frightening about that, but he did not know.
He simply added, "My whole life has been useless. I mean, everything I've done has been insignificant." .
"Compared to what?" I asked.
"If I had realized that [his complex double identity] a long time
ago," he replied.
The day after the regression Scott told me that he felt "at
peace" and that "all my questions just disappeared very quickly.
That's amazing." He told the support group on February 8 that he
felt quite "self-sufficient now." On December 23 he wrote me a
letter which accompanied a Christmas card. After writing emphatically about the "immense" weight he suspected went along with
"what you [referring to me] know" he shared further information
that had come to him since the regression.
"Success on Earth would take an incredible shift," he wrote, "a
shift from ego gratification to aspiring to achieve, but aspiring to
rid ourselves of the human flaw." The difficulty, he continued, is
to "eradicate the human flaws without destroying the machine itself. They are glued together very tight. The growing pains are extreme but necessary." Communicating with his alien voice he then
wrote, "Our intellectual abilities and the scope of our view is too
much for humans to understand. The translators, as I am, are necessary in order to make contact . . . I' ve always known. I've always denied [his alien identity]. I always wanted to forget, but
that's not who I am. The reality comes through the thick screen
of human defenses. The study continues of the human-alien consciousness struggle. They are integrating, each learning from the
other . . . I am at peace now. I understand I realize the conflict
will continue inside me, but I have reached the turning point
where my power of uncontrol has overcome that of my human
side.
"I fear humans more than anything else," the letter went on.
"We have tried to change you many times . Many members of our
species have been destroyed in the process ... I must say the human being has very heightened emotions, too much for me to
process at times. We are very sensitive, but our emotions are not
as primitive as your own. Your emotions are recreation in a sense.
We are happy to be able to feel more than we normally feel. Our
fascination [with humans] revolves on this. Our evolutionary process has deemed emotions less important than understanding, but
it's like candy to a child your emotions to us. It is like a drug that
we enjoy very much.
"It is interesting," the letter concluded, "that this is the very
thing which also makes you so dangerous to us. I do not feel it
is safe for me to come out yet. It will be a few years. I feel there
is much I wish to convey, and I feel at a time very soon there
should be a meeting of the high powers of your world with us."
Although he had a few anxious nights following the regression, in
the next few months Scott made rapid strides toward achieving
greater peace of mind, a heightened sense of energy and purpose,
integration of his human/alien identity, and deepening understanding of the meaning for him of his abduction experiences: He was
confident about the information he had received and conveyed in
our regressions, and felt that for the first time he could face its
implications honestly and realistically.

DISCUSSION
Scott's case illustrates the multiple levels on which we can think
about the abduction phenomenon. At one level he is, or has been,
a typically traumatized abductee. He has experienced the terror,
helplessness, paralysis, and instrumentation-especially the humiliating forced extraction of sperm for making babies (which he
later reported seeing during a regression)-that have followed
upon several recalled childhood abduction experiences in association, on at least one occasion, with a close-up UFO sighting. But
in addition to this nuts-and-bolts, or clearly physical, dimension,
Scott has also undergone an important personal transformation
that has been the result of a shift in his attitude toward his experiences. Of inestimable importance in this process has been the
support of Scott's parents, especially his mother, Emily (herself a
possible experiencer), who has attended conferences on the subject of abductions, come regularly to my monthly support group,
and volunteered to undergo hypnosis with me in order to understand more deeply her own experiences and the ways that she can
more fully support Scott and his si ster, Lee, who is also an
abductee.
Through his constant attitude of inquiry, his search for spiritual
meaning, and, above all, his willingness to confront and move
through his terror repeatedly, Scott has been able to achieve considerable peace of mind and a deeper sense of understanding of
the abduction experience process. By overcoming his denial and
accepting the instinctual, natural basis of his bodily terror and resentment, Scott has been able to open his psyche to important information concerning a widening sense of his own identity and to
take responsibility for his apparent role as a "translator" between
our two worlds. A crucial period for him in this process was the
summer months of 1992 when he was twenty-four. He was then
able to acknowledge deep within himself his vulnerability, helplessness in the face of ·the power of the alien energies, and the
stark fact of his lack of control. He discovered then, as he later
wrote in his Christmas letter to me, his "power of uncontrol."
Scott feels that his psychic powers have increased as a result of
his experiences.
As has occurred in the case of several abductees with whom I
have been working recently, Scott's full acknowledgment of the
reality of the alien presence has led him to the realization that he
always had a kind of dual identity, and is capable of experiencing
himself as both human and alien. The alien perspective, which apparently has always been -
imbedded in his consciousness, was not
available to him until he surrendered the illusion of control. From
this point of view Scott, like many abductees, has been able to
grasp fully what a dangerous species we are, not only to the aliens
themselves but to the living forms of the earth, especially as we
apply destructive technologies so mindlessly. In his alien identity
he comprehends how fear and anger, which are not part of the
alien experience, constrict our capacity for love and connection.
Knowing himself to be "one of them" has allowed Scott to experience the ways in which our two species are in some way linked
(there is a "correspondence" between us, he says), the basis for
which we are only beginning to understand.
It is hard to know what to make of some of the information
Scott reported in his second regression with me. Like other
abductees he speaks of another planet from which the aliens have
come, one that has been made arid and lifeless by "science," and
he warns of the depopulation of the earth through natural catastrophe, especially a more communicable form of AIDS. This kind of
apocalyptic vision is common among abductees, but we have no
way of knowing whether it is authentically predictive in the physical world-it certainly is not inconsistent with what we know to
be occurring on the planet-or represents some sort of metaphoric
prophecy or wake-up call. The question is made easier (or more
difficult, depending on one's point of view) by the fact that in the
realms of consciousness and of existence to which abductees
travel during their experiences the distinction between the literal
and the metaphoric, or the objective and the subjective, seems to
lose its power.
Finally, there is a poignancy for Scott and his family in the vain
and intrusive search that was made during his childhood and adolescence for a conventional medical explanation for his abduction experiences. Countless hours of medical examinations, tests,
and procedures resulted in wrong diagnoses and inappropriate ,
treatment. I suspect that even as these words are being written, a
child abductee somewhere is being taken by anxious parents to a
physician who is steadfastly ignorant of the abduction phenomenon, as Scott's parents were when he was a child. Hopefully
through the "translation" of experiencers like Scott, and parents
like Emily and Henry ("and physicians," Scott added) who are
willing to consider the possibility of realities of which in Scott's
words there is "little knowledge," other children may eventually
be spared the compounding of the trauma that ignorance and denial bring.

===================================================================
CHAPTER SIX. AN ALIENATION OF AFFECTIONS

The reported iptrusive sexual and reproductive procedures that are
a central aspect of the abduction phenomenon can profoundly affect the intimate life and general well-being of abductees. If the
source of this "alienation" is unrecognized, and conventional psychosexual explanations are the only ones actively pursued, the
problems may deepen and the stresses that abductees and their
loved ones experience are likely to increase. On the other hand,
important therapeutic gains become possible when the apparent
source of the experiencer's dysfunction is discovered. This problem is well illustrated by the case of Jerry.
Jerry, who describes herself as "an ordinary housewife," had
just turned thirty when she called my office in early June 1992.
When I first met with her she consciously reported a struggle with
many UFO dreams, abduction encounters, and related experiences
dating back to age seven. At her mother's insistence Jerry had reluctantly dismissed these as "nightmares" until she saw my name
and "Harvard University" on the credits for the CBS miniseries
on abductions, Intruders, and "figured, well, that person might be
a little more trustworthy and I jotted your name down." Also, at
a friend's recommendation, her mother had read one of Budd
Hopkins 's books and said to Jerry that the accounts of abductions
there sounded like her experiences.
Our meetings have included four hypnosis, or relaxation, sessions. In addition, Jerry has shared hundreds of pages of journal
entries with me, which she began writing several months before
she contacted me. These include details of her abduction experiences, poems, and the discussion of extensive philosophical ideas
related to the profound transformational process she has been undergoing. ·
Jerry is the second of four children and as a child lived in a rural area near Kansas City, Missouri, where her father worked at a
dairy processing plant. Her older brother, Ken, also reported having had peculiar childhood experiences, including seeing unusual
white and blue lights outside his window and terrible "nightmares" of "someone" entering his room while he was awake.
Shortly before she met with me, Jerry and Ken talked about their
experiences, and she discovered that "he's been plagued with
them his whole life." In addition, in her first relaxation session
Jerry described seeing her younger brother, Mark, being abducted
with her when he was an infant and she was seven, but she has
not discussed her experiences with him.
Jerry's parents were divorced when she was eight. Her father
remained in Missouri after the separation, and for many years
Jerry had little contact with him. Recently she has had long conversations with him and feels that they are now becoming closer.
After the divorce Jerry's mother, who has worked consistently as
a social worker, moved with the four children to Macon, Georgia.
Jerry remained close to her mother and over the years has consistently confided important experiences to her. During Jerry's later
childhood and adolescence the family moved about a good deal in
Georgia. "Perhaps we were gypsies at heart," she suggests. She
joined the Brownies and then the Girl Scouts and went to summer
camp where she took horseback-riding lessons and enjoyed riding
and being with horses. Later, we discovered, Jerry identified the
colts and their "dark, almond-shaped eyes" with hybrid alien beings. Although 
her teachers told her that she was a student capable of college work, 
Jerry left high school at the beginning of the
tenth grade when an English teacher imposed college-level 
assignments she could not handle and the school refused to transfer her
to another class. After this she held various cashiering and clerical
jobs.
Given the fact that she has only a ninth grade education, both
Jerry and her friends were surprised at the "flood" of poems and
complex information that she first began to write down five or six
years ago. Her writing intensified greatly in November 1991 following a powerful abduction experience. "I don't know where it's
coming from," she said. Indeed, the sophistication and articulateness of her writings do seem beyond her educational level. She
said that words whose meaning she does not know have come to
her as she writes, but she has discovered when she looks them up
that they contribute to a consistent set of ideas. Jerry felt that
many of her ideas did not come from within herself but from
some other source. She said she was so shocked by communications she received from the beings themselves just after the November 1991 abduction experience that she burned her first
notebooks.
Jerry's first marriage was to Brad when she was nineteen and
pregnant with her daughter, Sally. She never loved him, and they
were divorced in 1986. Jerry says that her ex-husband played sexual "games" with the children involving oral sex but not penetration. Jerry once thought that this was the result of her own
aversion to sexuality. "I don't really think that is true any longer,"
she wrote in a journal entry in January 1993. "He could have had
an affair instead. It was something about him that made him
choose to do what he did, and I probably chose him because subconsciously I may have picked up on something in him that
worked for me. Maybe he was not a threat to me sexually. I could
easily get away with not having to deal with my fear of sex with
him. He actually accepted the idea of having a sexless marriage."
In 1989 Jerry married her second husband, whose name is Bob.
He works as a carpenter. She loves Bob, and longs to have a normal affectional and sexual relationship with him. In her journal
she wrote, "Now I find myself in a much better marriage with a
man who has a normal sexual orientation who desires to have a
normal sexual relationship with me." But her abduction experiences have made this impossible. "I keep telling myself that my
husband is innocent and is not going to hurt me like the beings
do," Jerry wrote in January 1993. "I keep telling myself that it is
different, that he loves me and is not going to hurt me. I try to
keep positive thoughts, but when it comes time to have sex, forget
it. All of that goes out the door, and I am back being afraid. My
feelings during sex are like the feelings I have when I'am abducted. I feel frightened, used, and feeling that I have to endure
this [at other times she has said that having sex is like 'going to
the gynecologist or being raped']. Also, I think that I will be hurt
at anytime. A feeling of powerlessness, and the inability to have
any say in the matter. I think that I get a safe feeling when I say
no to my husband and he respects that. I am desperate to resolve
this problem. I just don't know how to do it."
Jerry's fears of intimacy have extended to being touched at all,
and she often would drown her sorrow and frustration in alcohol.
"I only drank when I thought I might have sex," she wrote in
September 1992. Assuming that her sexual problem was rooted in
early incest or sexual abuse, Jerry and her ex-husband went to
three different marriage counselors. On one occasion her "nightmares" were interpreted as "something trying to work its way up
to the surface," but nothing useful emerged and Jerry broke off
the counseling.
Whereas her first husband was frightened by anything out of
the ordinary and would not have listened to her talk about her abduction experiences, Jerry felt that her current husband and his
family were supportive and understanding; at least at first. Bob
was present during our first relaxation session and was powerfully
affected by the authenticity of his wife's experience. But disbelief
on the part of Bob's family seemed to close in around her so that
Jerry has felt increasingly isolated and alone with her experiences,
relying almost exclusively on other abductees, Pam, and me for
support. The pulling away of her in-laws has been particularly
painful. "His family doesn't socialize with me like they used to,"
Jerry told me in March 1993. "So, you know, it's painful, because
they're the only family I have and I don't like them to think of
me, you know, as the eccentric one, the crazy one." But "there's
no going back. I have to learn to live with it," she says.
All three of Jerry's children appear to be involved in the abduction phenomenon. From the time Sally, who was born in 1981,
was six she has had severe nightmares and will scream out "Don't
touch me. Leave me alone." When she was nine or ten she had
frequent unexplained and severe nosebleeds. She also has reported
seeing UFOs filling the sky in her dreams or imagination and has
remarked to Jerry that maybe the aliens choose specific families.
Sally has "dreams" about the family going onto a deck and seeing
a spaceship coming and of "a lot of little creatures surrounding
her." In another dream an alien girl with no hair and a red bow
"stuck to her head" came to her window and asked her to come
out and play. She said she went to play with the girl and was
shown around a spaceship. Following one of Sally's more recent
nightmares, Jerry found her on top of her blankets with her nightgown twisted up and her underwear missing. Sally was groggy
and Jerry could not wake her. In June 1993, Sally became frightened when she experienced an unexplained time lapse of nearly
an hour while she was timing herself reading a book for school.
She looked at the clock which said 6:02, read for what seemed
like a couple of minutes, looked again and saw it was 6:58. "How
could that be?" she asked her mother in alarm, and Jerry groped
for some explanation such as she had fallen asleep. But Sally insisted this was not the case.
Matthew was born in 1983. He was frightened of the puppets
he called "wo-wo's" from Sesame Street that came through a window. When the alien puppets were being shown, Matthew would
cry and scream and tell his mother to turn off the TV. Bert, one
of the puppets, had "scary big eyes," Matthew said. He was also
frightened by a TCBY yogurt commercial in which a UFO flew
down and landed. When this was shown, Matthew ran out of the
room and again screamed for his mother to turn off the TV. He
spoke of a dream of a pyramid-shaped flying saucer that talked to
him and had eyes. Both children reacted strongly to the picture of
an alien when Jerry showed them the Hopkins Image Recognition
Test cards (HIRT) she obtained from a friend who was also an
abductee. Sally "lost her breath" and put her fingers in her mouth.
Frightened, Matthew asked, "Has Sally seen that?" and "What did
she do?"
Colin was three in February 1993. His involvement has been
intense and is well documented in Jerry's notes, her conversations
with me, and a careful evaluation by another child psychiatrist.
Jerry also described witnessing his presence during her own abduction experiences. In a journal entry dated August 14, 1992,
when Colin was two and a half years old, Jerry wrote of hearing
him crying and talking to himself in the night. She went into his
room and found him sitting up in bed. "He seemed very awake."
He asked for juice, which she brought him, and then "started to
ramble on about lights outside and owls with eyes." He pointed
out the window and said, "See the eyes." Jerry felt "so weird because earlier that night I had the strong feeling that they were
around." She took Colin upstairs to tell Bob what he had been
saying, but "he got angry and said he must have had a nightmare." Colin is generally a sound sleeper, Jerry noted, and "never
asks to sleep with us or even has a habit of waking up at night."
But that night, for the first time, he would not sleep in his own
bed and insisted upon sleeping with his parents.
This behavior continued for several nights, and Jerry wrote in
her journal on October 29 that Colin talked often and consistently
about "these things." When Jerry and Colin were outside together
he would look up into the sky and ask about the stars and the
moon and then talk about the "scary owls with the big eyes" that
"fall down out of the sky" or "floated" down. A few times he
demonstrated what the eyes looked like by circling his eyes with
his hands curved in the shape of a C. One time he went "into a
lot of action like running and screaming and saying that they
make me eat some food and they attack [a word he actually uses]
me," especially hurting his toe.
Colin also talked about spaceships, planets, and stars. One night
he climbed in bed with his mother and noticed a small picture of
the earth on the binding of a book. "That's the planet Earth," he
said, and "it go away" and "the house go away." Pointing at the
ceiling he said, 'They say bye-bye see ya." Then he jumped out
of bed and enacted a scene, talking anxiously. "The owls with big
eyes fall down and jump and I jump," and "there's a spaceship
and I come out of the spaceship ... My toe hurt," he said, and
"the big eyes are scary, Mommy." After this Jerry actually found
blood at the end of one of Colin's toes and a tom toenail.
On November 8, I met with Colin, who was then two years and
nine months old, and his parents in my home while his brother
and sister played in the backyard He impressed me as a sweet,
lively boy, but he revealed few of his fears. He called the alligator
puppet a "tiger" that liked to bite. (Later he would ask his mother,
"Why do the tigers go and get you?" and seemed to have replaced
the owl with the big eyes with the tiger.) He was particularly interested in the large globe in my office and wanted to locate himself on it. I went through the HIRT cards with him, and he reacted
strongly only to the alien card, which he called a "scary man,"
and became more anxious after this. In her journal on November
15 Jerry wrote that Colin had cried out "Ouchy ! Ouchy !" several
times during the night. When she and Bob went in to see him he
was sound asleep, but the next morning he said that the "monster
owls" hurt his leg. Climbing into his parents' bed and pointing to
the ceiling Colin said, "What's that big boat, that big boat in the
sky."
In her journal entry of January 28, 1993, Jerry wrote that Colin's distressing experiences seemed to be occurring every week or
two. On January 25, when she and Colin were in the bathroom as
she was preparing to meet Bob for lunch, he said several times in
an angry, frightened voice, "I don't want to go back to the spaceship !" Then, standing on the toilet with his teeth and fist clenched
and obviously distressed, he said several times, "I get lost. I don't
like it." Calming down, he said, "I was born there and fell from
the stars." When Jerry asked him to repeat what he had said he
added, "I born on the spaceship and it was dark." Then he became
tense again and wiggled around. She asked him how he got onto
the spaceship and he circled his eyes with his hands and said,
'The eyes." When Jerry asked him if there was anyone on the
spaceship with him he answered, "Yeah, I see the King. I see the
King and He is God." Jerry wondered where he obtained the verbal skills, seemingly beyond his years, to say these things.
On the night of January 27, Colin came into his parents' room
and climbed into bed with them. Jerry found this unusual as the
gate on his bedroom door had been locked and no one remembered having opened it. Meanwhile a monitor that picked up
sounds from the toddler 's room started making strange, loud
noises, clicking on and off so loudly that Colin asked Bob to turn
it off.
In light of his continuing distress, and because I wanted to see
if a conventional psychopathological explanation for Colin's
symptoms might be found in an independent evaluation, I asked
a capable and - I thought-open-minded child psychiatrist colleague who was not especially familiar with the abduction phenomenon to evaluate Colin. This doctor met with Colin and his
family in February and sent me his report in March. Dr. C. did not
find much that was remarkable in Colin's history other than the
story of his encounters, saw him as a "very cute and engaging
boy," and discovered little marital tension between Jerry and Bob,
except in relation to Jerry's abduction experiences. Colin played
with puppets and became interested in a rubber snake that ate fingers and toes. He referred to his own toe being hurt, but evinced
little distress about this.
Although Dr. C. found no explanation for Colin's problems, he
wondered if they might be tied to an as yet undiscovered incident
in the family, perhaps related to interactions with his brother who
had a history of sexual abuse and with whom Colin had shared a
room for a time. He speculated also whether Colin's symptoms
might be related to TV images of spaceships and the planet Earth,
though his TV watching was restricted. Colin's distress seemed to
abate some after this evaluation, and Dr. C. recommended no further intervention at this time, 
although he offered to see Colin further if his fears persisted. One effect of this evaluation seemed to
be to divide Jerry and Bob a little further in their perception of the
source of Colin's problems. Dr. C.'s failure to discover a more
conventional explanation of Colin's symptoms affirmed Jerry's
view that they were related to UFO abductions. But Bob found
Dr. C. 's search for a more conventional traumatic source within
the family reassuring, as he has resisted the idea that abduction
experiences have a reality, at least where his little son is concerned. In June, upon seeing a book with an alien on the cover
Colin remarked, "He 's a Rocketeer. He goes up and comes down."
Jerry has the sense that abduction experiences and related phenomena have been happening throughout her life. She has always
known that the experiences that were so readily labeled nightmares by her mother and others were powerfully real for her.
Thus she has always lived with a strong feeling of isolation and
the sense that she had no choice but to deny a major "part of my
life." The appearance of scoop marks, scars, bruises, and other
small lesions following abduction experiences helped Jerry affirm
the actuality of what she has undergone throughout the years before she found a community of experiencers and investigators
who were familiar with the phenomenon.
Jerry's first consciously recalled abduction experience occurred
when she was seven and still living in Kansas City. This episode
will be discussed in detail in relation to her first hypnosis session.
Before the regression she described having seen some sort of unusual light, a spaceship, and small, thin, gray beings outside her
window. When she told her mother of seeing these things she was
told it was a nightmare, but Jerry "told her adamantly that I was
not imagining or dreaming it, that it was real."
"I saw lights, I saw the ship, I saw them," Jerry said in our initial meeting, and "never once did I say it was a dream or a nightmare." The perennial insistence by her mother that these
experiences that she felt were real were just dreams made Jerry
doubt her own sense of reality. During the first relaxation session,
in the course of talking about her abduction experience at age
seven, Jerry indicated that she had had earlier encounters. She
could not say how old she was, but spoke of being small and that
"I wasn't afraid before when I saw them the first time. I thought
they were cute ... Lots of them" were outside the window, "just
real happy," and encouraged her to "come and play." When she
was nine and staying in a motel just before moving to Georgia,
Jerry remembers feeling a presence in the room and the frightening sense that "someone had j ust sat on my bed." At age eight she
had an important traumatic and intrusive experience which we explored in our fourth session.
A still more disturbing episode for her, which we explored in
detail in the second hypnosis session, occurred in Georgia when
Jerry was thirteen. She said she woke up terrified and remembered
pressure in the abdomen and genital area and that she could not
move. "In my head I was screaming," Jerry said, but does not
know if any sound came out. "Somebody was doing something,"
she recalled, but it was "something alien." Although she recalls
wondering to herself, "Is that how sex is done?" she knew with
great certainty that "it wasn't a person."
Jerry wrote in her journal about two weeks before we explored
this experience in the regression how her difficulties with intimacy and sexuality had begun soon after it. She was dating her
first "real boyfriend," who was about two years older than she.
Jerry found that she was "tenifled by the idea of doing anything
more than j ust kissing," whereas she had dated and "experimented
with petting and none of it bothered me in the least" before this.
Her parents were asleep, and Jerry and her boyfriend were in her
bedroom. He suggested that they "do more than just kiss and
hug." Wanting to "be rid of' her "fear of being touched anywhere
on my private areas" she allowed him to "touch me in between
my legs, to put it nicely." B ut then "I freaked out. I was completely tensed up. My whole body was stiff as a board. I went into
a kind of panic attack. I was sweating and shaking and my heart
was racing. I looked at my hand and all of a sudden it started to
shrink and shrivel up. It started to turn grayish. I was petrified. I
don't know what I did after that, but whatever it was -it scared my
boyfriend enough to go and wake up my mother. She came in and
calmed me down." Jerry did not talk of this incident with anyone,
but wrote, "Ever since then I have had an aversion to sex."
In the years that followed, Jerry reported that she had a number
of "nightmares" in which she would awake paralyzed, hear "buzzing and ringing and whirring" noises in her head, and see humanoid beings in her room. "They were really causing me to lose a
lot of sleep," she wrote. There was an episode in 1987 where she
saw beautiful "glitter and sparkles" that seemed to have been
thrown into the room, but she screamed in terror as two small beings wearing some sort of shiny "outfit or uniform" floated above
her bed. She believes that she screamed and tried to wake Bob,
who was then her fiance, "but he did not budge." As the beings
came closer to her, Jerry became still more frightened and "then
a blank" and "I don't remember anything after that." In a later regression with another therapist, in which she investigated this experience, Jerry said she . was deeply moved when twin girls were
shown to her which she feels were her own hybrid offspring.
In 1990, Jerry experienced the most traumatic of the abduction
episodes. We have not yet investigated this one under hypnosis
because of the intensity of the terror and pain associated with it,
but Jerry has consciously reported many details of it. She and Bob
had just bought a duplex apartment in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
She does not remember how the episode began, except that she
felt a presence and a tapping on her shoulder. She experienced being taken into a circular room which was shiny and metalliclooking and contained what looked like - equipment. As she was
suspended in a standing position and tests were being performed,
Jerry recalls that her necklace flew - off and fell to the floor. She
communicated telepathically with a tall being with "blondish" hair
who appeared to be the leader. When she told him that her necklace had come off, he said he saw it and motioned to a smaller being to pick it up. Jerry was told she could not have it just then
because it was "contaminated" and the beings put it in a "plasticlooking pouch." The leader promised that it would be returned to
her some other time. Months later her mother found (Jerry had
told her about the necklace in the episode) what Jerry believes
was the same necklace in a box in Georgia.
At first Jerry was not frightened during this episode, and was
pleased that she was able to converse with the beings. The leader
asked "how the medication has been so far," and she made the
mistake of saying ''fine." For after this a procedure was done to
the back of her head above the neck that caused the most excruciating pain she had ever experienced, "even worse than childbirth ... I thought they were killing me," she said, and reports
screaming, "How could you? You asked me how my medication
is." In addition to the raw pain, Jerry felt muscle spasms that were
out of her control and extended in rapid succession from her legs
to her facial muscles. She screamed for them to stop and was
filled with hate and rage. "Here I thought they were somehow
perfect and loving beings. How could they have done that to me?
I was so terrified. I blanked out after that. The next thing I was
back in bed, waking up." Although she usually goes to sleep
curled up in a self-protecting position on her side, Jerry awoke on
her back. Her body was very rigid and straight, her hands were
folded on her chest and her feet were pointing straight up and
close together. Still panicked, Jerry tried to wake her husband but
could not do so. She then telephoned her mother in Georgia because "I needed to tell someone what had just happened."
In one of the three episodes in 1991, Jerry reports being taken
by taller, more human-looking, fair-skinned, blond beings to what
seemed like the top of a very large building with illuminated
equipment in it. She had the sense that she was at a beach or a
seashore, as she heard the wind and the water breaking, felt a
breeze, and smelled the sea. High up in this building, Jerry was
shown scenes of missiles and other weapons. She felt this was
very important. They also showed her some sort of triangular machine that became circular when it spun and "had to do with flight
maybe." Jerry was assured that she would not ever forget what
she was shown on this occasion. The next day she found herself
making triangies out of paper or with pencils and toothpicks and
"spinning [them] around and around."
In November 1991, Jerry awoke, feeling a presence once again.
The room appeared filled with an orange-red light that soon receded. The next day her mind seemed to be "turned up full volume," flooded with thoughts. Jerry felt as if she were filled with
information of a "universal" sort, "soul stuff, unusual for me." After this, as mentioned above, she wrote intensely. Her writings included a hundred poems over the next one and a half months,
whereas before this "I never wrote a poem in my life." She found
the pressure of these thoughts and writing quite overwhelnilng and
said, "I don't know where it's coming from."
In the months prior to our first hypnosis session on August 11,
1992, Jerry continued to have abduction experiences, including
one episode just three weeks before, in which she consciously recalled seeing a UFO close-up and being taken by humanoid
beings-whose attitude she felt was loving and benevolent-into
the ship. There she reported seeing shelves with instruments and
vials, being seated on a chair or table, and having a complex dialogue with aliens she felt were "beyond what we would think is
intelligent or even genius." One of them explained that they came
from so "far into the future" that she would not be able to comprehend. Jerry described saying to herself, "This is great. I can see
everything and I am so aware." In her journal she concluded, "I
was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that what I was ex­
periencing was real . They looked at me with their loving and all knowing smile and simply said, 'yes. ' I then said, well, if this is
real then I am somehow living a double life ... I had a feeling
there was a definite reason that I and others like me were not
aware of this other reality, at least not as aware as we are about
this reality we have here and now."
Bob accompanied Jerry to our first hypnosis session. He came
as a skeptic, but said that either "she's lying to me" or "it's really
happening," and "She is not a liar at all ... She's the most honest
person I' ve ever met in my entire life." Nevertheless, some measure of Bob's resistance was suggested when he said that he "fell
asleep" through much of the Intruders miniseries, which contained some blood-curdling abduction scenes.
Before the regression began we reviewed several of Jerry's ab-
duction experiences, after which she spoke of her search for a
church that would feel more compatible than the Catholicism in
which she had been raised. "I kind of floated in and out through
religions with friends," she said. A local Protestant church seemed
the most comfortable to Jerry and Bob at first, but "they wanted
to fully change our lives," and, in his words, "we took a break
[from attending] and are enjoying it so far." Jerry was especially
troubled to find that she could not speak with anyone in the
church about her abduction experiences, for they regarded the
phenomenon as "totally evil, of the devil." God, they said, "would
never, ever make beings that looked like that," which turned Jerry
against the church, for in her view, the aliens are "another intelligence, or another being, another reality ... I don't feel they're
necessarily bad or good." Once when Jerry told several churchmen about an out-of-body experience she had had, "they went
straight to a high official who said, 'Well, don't ever do that. ' "
After this we discussed Jerry's curiosity about the episode in
Missouri when she was seven years old, and we decided to focus
on that. We reviewed in detail the location of her home, which
was on a hillside by a little creek and cow pastures, and the arrangement of the rooms in the house. Jerry shared a room with
bunk beds with her younger sister.
In the altered state of consciousness, Jerry's first images were
of her pink-walled bedroom and of standing on the floor in her
long flannel nightgown. The house was very quiet, and she reported feeling anxious and pulled to go out of her room and down
the hall. She said that a strange bright light filled the room. Jerry
had the thought, "I shouldn't be afraid 'cause I know them." Despite her mounting fear she felt compelled to come out of her
room into the hall and then into the living room. Outside of the
house, in the direction from which the light seemed to be coming,
Jerry said she saw perhaps twenty or thirty small beings and
backed up in terror. She could not move as several beings passed
through the window frame into the room. "I wouldn't go out, so
they had to come in," she said. Jerry felt that they became impatient with her and "just picked me up" from her crouched position. "I don 't want to go out the window," she said, as the
pressure became more intense.
To Jerry's amazement, she said the beings took her through
the window, "and then I went up real fast." As if "stopped in the
sky," Jerry could see the top of her house, the trees, and the
ground below. "It kind of took my breath away to go up so fast."
There was a "big thing above me" into which she was taken. De-spite the coercion, Jerry feels that she was somehow a participant
in this process, but "I don't know how, though." Weeping at this
point, Jerry saw that two of the beings were also "floating up" her
baby brother, Mark, and she worried that "he's probably afraid,"
although he appeared to be asleep.
Jerry felt like running away, but realized she was "paralyzed
kind of up to the waist." Breathing heavily in the session, with her
voice quivering, Jerry described the paralysis as being like a painful vibration. Then "a tremendous vibration" extended into her
hands, and "I'm afraid it' ll go through my whole body." I reassured her that reliving the experience would not harm her. "The
vibration is so strong. I don't understand it," she moaned, afraid
that she would not be able to breathe. "I can't do anything," and
"I'm worried about Mark," she cried. The powerful vibrations
seemed to shake Jerry's whole body. "Okay, do it to me, but it's
not fair to do it to him," she said. "He's a baby! I just hate them
for it ... I thought at first they were all right." Crying as she recalled an earlier abduction experience, Jerry said, "I just thought
they were cute and they wanted to come out and play."
Jerry said the round room inside the ship into which she and
Mark were first taken was dark in the beginning. Then she saw
that it was "domeshaped. It's real white ... It's got railings. It's
got different levels, and they're way up high. The people and the
machines are way up high." There were two curved tables in the
room, one for Mark and one for her, into which each of them was
placed. "He seems small" in his, she observed. "I j ust look over
at Mark and tell him to be good and not to move around," Jerry
said through her tears. "He might fall or something," she worried.
Jerry then reported seeing a small, "real dark," being standing
at the railing on the next level "just watching" her, and noticed
behind her a taller, lighter one she called "the leader." He looked
older, "wrinkly and tight," with "a nice face" and a "permanent
type of smile," wore a one-piece, goldish-yellow suit, and had a
little bit of stringy yellowish-white hair. His hands were "long and
skinny." This being communicated her name, "Jerry," to her, as if
he knew her, which she found frightening, especially as she realized he seemed familiar to her as well. All this made the whole
recollection more real to her. Breathing hard and her body shaking, Jerry cried out, "Oh, I don't know if I can do it! ... Up till
now it was j ust a dream," she said, but if she admitted that this
being is-· or was real, then "everything else would be real." Her
mother "was wrong" to have insisted that this experience was a
dream, Jerry said. "I' ve got to stop thinking about what every-
body else says ... I have to live my own life. I can't keep pleasing my mother," she added. "I have to stand up for" what happened, Jerry said, "no matter if people will think I'm crazy or
not."
The leader asked Jerry "if the medication has been okay up till
now," which Jerry did not understand. In the session, she then
seemed to relive an extremely agonizing procedure, involving the
insertion of "something sharp" like a "needle" into the side of her
head, which evidently had taken some time and against which
there was "no medication." She cried out desperately and sweated
profusely with her body writhing in pain as she tried to hold off
the memories. "I think it would kill me," she said. I assured her
that this reliving would not kill her and encouraged her to scream
as she described the instrument being driven from "a high angle"
down into the side of her neck. "Stop hurting me," she screamed
loudly and complained now of spasms and other uncontrollable
movements in her legs (which I could see). Panting, Jerry then
screamed out in terror, "I can't stop it! Ahhhh! Ahhhh ! I hate
doing this! Stop it! Stop this !"
Jerry's loud screaming and thrashing continued, and she cried
out, "They're turning it! They're turning it! Ohhhh! It's inside of
me. That's what he stuck inside of me. Ahhhh ! That thing! They
stuck that thing inside me !" I reassured Jerry as best I could that
she would be better when this was over. "It's coming out," she
said. "There's a leak. Something's dripping I feel like, in my
throat." She was not sure whether this had been blood, saliva, or
what. "They're letting me relax. They're awful. They' re cruel. I
thought they did something else. Oh [in a whisper], I didn't anticipate this." Jerry recalled that she was told that some sort of tiny
object was left inside of her at that time "to monitor me" with no
explanation other than, "We just have to do what we have to do."
"I think it's still there," she said. "I don't remember them taking it out." After this Jerry felt limp and tired. She did not know
what was done to Mark, but said, "If they did the same thing, I'd
kill them." She recalled little of what followed. The leader left
while she stayed for a few minutes on the table. Then she saw
flashes and dots of red and yellow light. She did not remember
how she got back to her home, nor did she recall being able to tell
her mother or anyone else any of the details of the trauma at the
time. As the regression came to an end, Jerry speculated on the
protective mechanisms that might until now have prevented her
from recalling this harrowing experience.
"I'm drenched," she said, as she came out of the altered state."I didn't think you could do that," she said, "to put me out." Her
arms and legs continued to "feel funny" for several minutes after
the session was over, and she observed that she had also felt "like
somebody turning you into a vibrating machine ... like somebody
put you inside a machine and you were part of that machine."
Their "medication" evidently referred to this vibratory process,
but she did not feel it in her neck or head and therefore the vibrations did not mute the pain. Jerry then recalled that when the anesthesiologist tried to give her a spinal injection to reduce pain
during the delivery of Colin, she screamed loudly, for it seemed
now to be "a similar thing" to what she had gone through on the
ship. Jerry said that this session upheld her childhood conviction
that the alleged "nightmare" at age seven was actually "a memory" of something that "must have just happened, then and there."
Bob, himself somewhat in shock over what he had seen his wife
go through, said at the end of the session, "It's a lot, a lot to take.
At first I wasn't sure, and I saw it bugging her as much as it's
been, the pain and everything. I started getting a little worried
there." But then he found a way to "just kinda sit back. I was
glued to the chair at first, but then I had to start getting up ... "
The day after the session, Jerry and I had a follow-up telephone
conversation. She expressed shock over how vividly she had relived the abduction experience. ''I thought I would just have a few
memories," she said. Jerry noted how reluctant she had been to
look at the alien beings themselves. This was just too scary, for
"what we see we know." She was confused about the intensity of
her pain and wondered if some elements of her 1990 experience
had become confused with the childhood experience just explored.
In her journal she tried to sort out the elements of the experience
from when she was seven and the 1990 one, but was at a disadvantage because she had not explored the adult incident under
hypnosis.
In the weeks that followed Jerry described in her journal various other current and past abduction experiences, related dreams,
"vivid dreams of UFOs," visions, and out-of-body experiences,
stimulated by the regression. It was also during this time that
CoHn began to tell of his experiences, and Jerry recorded these in
her journal. Six days after the regression she wrote, "I feel that
part of a long and heavy burden has been lifted from me since the
regression." On August 27, she saw a beam or pillar of light appear in front of the stairs in her house and thought of calling me
but did not do so. Qn September 21, Jerry recorded for the first
time a frequent recurrent dream about a horse that she wished to
take home in order to care for properly. At the end of the dream
she felt "cheated of the opportunity to be with and take care of
my horse." In September, Jerry began to ponder her sexual fears,
and related them for the first time to the traumas of her abduction
experiences. It was Jerry's desire to overcome these fears and
"have a normal sexual relationship" that led her to request a second hypnosis session.
This meeting occurred on October 5, and Jerry explicitly stated
her wish to find out why she had tried to avoid sex "at all costs."
Bob's sister, Anna, was present during the session. Jerry elected to
explore the episode in which, as a thirteen-year-old, she had been
terrified during the night by pressure in the abdomen and genital
area. Before beginning the regression, we recalled the circumstances surrounding the episode, which probably occurred in the fall
of 1975 when Jerry was starting the eighth grade. Although she
had found the episode frightening, she told no one, including her
mother, about it.
Under hypnosis Jerry's first images were of awakening to discover bright, white light illuminating her room. She felt a presence that frightened her and thought, "If I'm just real quiet they
won't get me." The beings tried to reassure her by telling her not
to be afraid, but this did not work because "they're so full of
lies." Although "I don't want to see them," Jerry noted two beings, "one behind me and one over here [to her side]." They told
her she must go with them and ignored her protests. "They grab
me by my arms," Jerry said, and she felt a "gentle, soft, like velvet, cold" contact. This touch seemed to relax her, and next Jerry
found herself "just kind of going with them. Slow. Slow going up.
It's weird. I don't know how they can do that."
With one being on each side of her Jerry said they floated her
"out the window, like the wall. It's like it's not there." She got
"that paralyzed feeling again" as she was pulled up to a large
craft. "This pulling on scares me," Jerry said, as her breathing became more rapid and shallow. She was taken through an opening
into "this same stupid room" where "bad things happen." Two beings were doing something to a table, "like getting it ready or
something. I just have no control." A taller being she has seen "a
lot" since age five but does not like knowing told her not to be
scared, but her fear was building nevertheless. "Don't they understand what they're doing?" Jerry protested. As a small child she
trusted this being, but now felt betrayed by him. "He just doesn't
have any patience," and despite her protests "they just put me on
the table anyway. You can't argue with them."Jerry felt "embarrassed" before the aliens as they took off her
pajamas. "It's like they think they're doctors or something. I don't
think they're doctors." Lying on her back now, Jerry felt somehow
more "relaxed" and less afraid. One of the beings put his hands
over her eyes and pressed something that "looks like a tube"
through the wall of her abdomen above the umbilicus. With the
instrument still deep within her abdomen, the being took his hands
away from her eyes and Jerry felt more relaxed and also sleepy
and tired. Next she noted that one of the beings was holding a
shiny, horseshoe-shaped object with a handle on it as others bent
her knees upward and apart. Crying now she said, "He's going to
cover my eyes again. Why is he doing this? I don't think I want
to know. I don't want to know what they did." She told the beings
she will tell her mother, but they said that she won' t. "She
wouldn't let them do this if she was here," Jerry lamented poignantly. She said that the beings insisted that she would not tell
because she would not remember.
At this point I asked her if it was "Okay for you to remember
now?" She said that it was, but exclaimed, "It's not fair!" which
I, of course, agreed with. "They tried to make me think it was just
a nightmare," she complained. "What do they think, I' m just an
animal or something?" Jerry's fear mounted once again as she felt
"pressure" inside her vagina. She objected that although the beings kept reassuring her that she would not remember, she has, in
fact, remembered what happened. Then she cried and moaned,
sobbing, "I just want my mom," as she felt "something round inside," a cramped and "pinched feeling . . . Why are they doing
this?" Jerry cried out. "I'm not going to let them do this again !"
I encouraged her to express her emotions. "Why won't this end?
Stop it! !" she cried.
Finally, this part of the ordeal was over. It felt to Jerry as if
something had been placed deep within her body, beyond the vagina, perhaps through the cervix. As an adult, she had had an
abortion and this felt something like the D & C procedure. She
saw the horseshoe-shaped instrument being removed from her
body and struggled with the memory of what it held. "I don't
want to go any further," she protested. I reassured her of my presence and left the choice to her. "It can't be," she said in a whisper.
"Oh, I can't believe it. I'm too young for that. I' m only thirteen."
She wailed, "Oh. Oh. This can't be. It can't be. I just must be ...
I don't know."
What Jerry saw was a "baby" that was "real tiny, skinny." The
beings seemed very pleased with their efforts and showed her this
creature, which was perhaps ten inches long. She could not make
out many other details except that there were tiny hands and the
head seemed big compared to the body. The baby was placed in
a clear plastic "cylinder-looking thing" where it floated in some
sort of fluid. "Why would they do this?" Jerry exclaimed. "I don't
understand this. I'm too little to have a baby. They just told me
not to worry. I don't have to take care of it." I asked Jerry what
feeling of connection she had with this fetus and she replied, "I
think they made me feel it's not mine. It's theirs. It's a part of
them." As Jerry lay on the table for what seemed like half an
hour, the aliens seemed to be "working on the little baby." Then
they brought it up close for her to look at. The beings wanted
Jerry to feel proud of the accomplishment of producing this creature. But she felt angry, confused, used, and betrayed.
Jerry continued to express her intense feeling of shock and disbelief. "I didn't even know I had anything like that in me!" she
said with a weak laugh. "If they' re gonna do this, they should at
least tell you," she added. I asked if she had been given any further information about what this was all about. The "leader person," she said, "told me that it was beautiful, and that one day I
would understand, but it was about creation."
"Creation of what?" I asked.
"I guess, like a new being. A new race, or a new-I don't
know. He didn't really say specifically." He just said that at "a
point in time of their own" she would know. "They said it was
beautiful. It was wonderful," and "just to trust that it had to do
with creation."
At this point Jerry began a debate with herself as to whether to
tell me the leader's name, which she apparently knew. To speak
it, she said, would make him more real, give him a stronger identity. Once when she was writing he seemed to speak to her and
asked, "Do you deny?-I think he was wanting me to admit him.
I think he wanted me to remember." The name that came to her
was something like "Moolana."
As the session neared the end, Jerry reported being helped to
get dressed, but had only "real fuzzy" information about how she
returned to her house and came back into her bed. She awoke on
her back and at the time recalled only that a being had stood over
her, "put pressure on my stomach," and was "doing something
down on my private area." It seemed as if her conscious memory
had condensed the beginning of the abduction experience and
what occurred on the ship. Reviewing her experience, Jerry noticed that she had had no control whatsoever over what occurred.
As in the earlier childhood abduction experience explored in the
first regression, Jerry felt that she "wouldn't have been able to
handle it" were she to have recalled consciously the traumas of
this episode. But now she felt that "I was supposed to tell somebody" and "they initiated" that process.
As she came out of the altered state of consciousness, Jerry felt
relaxed, but continued to express her indignation toward the
aliens . "They have no right to do what they do and they're pretty
arrogant about it ... Just to take-don't they know, don't they
know us well enough to know that a thirteen-year-old doesn't do
that? ... It's for their purposes . They' re being pretty selfish." But
at the same time that she felt she was "a tool for their design,"
Jerry also felt that she was participating in a plan that came from
a "higher" place. "My feeling is it's not just them."
Jerry spoke then of Bob's increased resistance to accepting the
reality of her experiences, largely, she believed, because of the implications for him of having his little son, Colin, involved. She recalled then that she and Colin have a similar inherited deformity
of one of their toes. Colin complains that "the owl bit my toe"
while Jerry has also had the experience of having her deformed
toe examined. She associated then to a silvery-blue flash she had
noticed one night recently as she was going to sleep and saw
DNA in large bold letters and heard the phrase "the marker trait,"
which has meaning in genetics research which Jerry was completely unfamiliar with.
We talked about the impact of this abduction experience on her
sexual life. Jerry was raised with an accepting attitude about "getting married, having sex, having babies," she said. "Sex means
getting married, having babies, caring, loving, and sharing." But
obviously "they [the aliens] don't do anything like that." They
have "no respect for feelings or love or relationships ... " When
she has sex now it revives traumatic abduction intrusions like the
one we had just relived. "When I have sex, that's how it feels. It
feels like they're doing that. It feels like I have to just grin and
bear it. When I'm having sex it's just like that. It's like I relive
it every time ... I transfer, I know I do ... I have no control over
this ... I never knew where that feeling came from." At the end
of the session Jerry had me look at a small, circular, indented scar
on her abdomen which she associated with the procedures just recalled. Until this session she had not known "where it came
from," but seemed to feel confident that it was the result of one
of her abduction experiences. I was unable to discover from Anna,
who seemed a bit stunned, what her reaction was to this session.
In the days that followed this regression Jerry had a difficult
time. She had trouble sleeping, cried a lot, and searched unsuccessfully for an alternate explanation. Anna, she said was torn by
what she had experienced in the session. She could not "believe"
it, but had said to Jerry, "I know you're not lying." Anna's skepticism made Jerry's attempt to integrate the experience more difficult. Meanwhile, she had consulted another therapist who lived
nearer than I to where she lived, in order to pursue her abduction
material more actively. But the brief hypnosis sessions with him,
which continued through the fall and winter, appeared to compound her trauma rather than help her. "I have more memories
coming to me than I can handle," she wrote in her journal in January. The therapist would push her to move ahead faster than she
felt ready, urged her to do weekly regressions, and threatened negative consequences if she refused to comply. She felt overwhelmed, and found it helpful to attend my monthly support
group. I also urged her to "slow down" and then to break off the
sessions with the other therapist as little integrative work seemed
to be accompanying the uncovering that was occurring.
Jerry faithfully recorded the experiences of the fall and winter
in her journal. Her fears for Colin, as recorded above, resulted in
the evaluations already described. She herself had had several
dreams of nuclear war in which there was general panic and she
heard herself say "it must be Armageddon." In one of the dreams
she "looked out into this vast nothingness and saw a UFO, and it
was slowly moving along with a beam of some sort shooting
down onto the land." Flooded by memories of abduction experiences that were coming up in the regressions with her therapist,
Jerry wrote of the "shattering" of "defense mechanisms" and the
extraordinary nature of a threatening experience that can recur unpredictably at any time. "I wonder if anyone who is not an
abductee," she wrote in early January, "could possibly comprehend what it means to not have any idea when the next abduction
could be" and "I would like to know how the mind works when
a person is subjected to continual trauma and knows that it may
not end."
At the end of January 1993, Jerry had what she called a "horse
dream" in which she was looking for "my horse" in a laboratorylike room with pools of water in little rectangular cubicles or
tanks. When she looked at these it made her feel sad. "It was almost pathetic." She noticed one of the horses closest to her. When
it turned its head toward her, it looked at her with "big dark
eyes.""These little horses were all hooked up to some wires in the
water. They all had long anns and legs and they were all very
skinny. Their heads look as if they couldn't hold them up even if
they wanted to. But this one turned its head and looked directly
into my eyes. I am not sure how I felt when it did that, but I felt
that in its eyes was an awareness that reached beyond what I
would imagine it would be capable of."
On March 4, Jerry came to see me, accompanied by a close
friend who was also an abductee. The purpose of the session was
to review what was happening in her life and plan for the future.
Jerry talked of her feelings of ostracism and isolation, especially
the pulling away of Bob's family, and the need for a community
of understanding around the abduction phenomenon. She recalled
now unexplained losses of fetuses that both her mother and sister
had experienced. Further discussion of the dream of the little
horses led Jerry to link them with another dream of hybrid baby
girls with which she felt a strong bond. "You' re our mother," the
girls had said, and she felt the same bond with one of the little
horses which she now thinks represented a human or hybrid infant.
Jerry sought a third relaxation session because there were still,
as she put it, "a few" of her abduction experiences "that keep
bothering me." She particularly had in mind the painful 1990 episode in which "I screamed and screamed and screamed" and the
1991 encounter from which she could still recall the smell of the
sea and hearing the waves on the beach. As it turned out, her psyche "chose" an incident in September 1992, which has had an especially profound impact on her intimate life.
We met on May 27, and Jerry came alone. Before beginning
the regression, Jerry talked of the increasing estrangement she was
feeling from her husband's family, which made her decide to stop
talking to them about her abduction experiences unless they
asked. Her mother-in-law, she said, "can't accept it at all. She
thinks if I'm a good little girl and I say my prayers, it'll all go
away. " But Jerry wondered what did, in fact, affect her abduction
experiences, for she felt as if she were "just fair game." She had
a sense, however, that her fearfulness makes the experiences
worse. One time she reported being more relaxed and "not fighting" and "that one was painless ... They were doing things. They
did something to my arm that made my arm swell up. They were
showing me things ... I guess I felt more of the communication,
more able to talk to them and ask questions, and I don't remember
any real answers."
Jerry does not feel that the beings want "to cause me fear and
pain and agony," and "deep down inside I think that what they're
doing is somehow necessary." It has to do, she said, with "races,
beings or whatever, coming together to make another creation."
This "was very important," she said, and "as a single person,
compared to this big huge thing going on, I should look beyond
myself and know that it's for the greater good." At the same time
Jerry noted that over the past year she had learned to think more
independently. "I feel I shed some of my old beliefs," she said,
and she no longer "blindly" follows "someone else or some organization." As a Catholic, she had been raised to feel that she was
"being disobedient to God" when she followed "my own instincts" or asked questions that challenged church belief. As we
prepared to begin the regression, Jerry lay on her side in a curled
up position rather than supine, as is more usual in relaxation sessions. She explained then that this is her habit at night as
well-"I' m thinking I can shrink up and cover up and pretend I'm
not here."
To her surprise, Jerry's attention lighted not on the abduction
experiences we had talked about, but on an episode in September
1992 that she described in which a golden light, so bright it hurt
her eyes, had filled her room. The alien beings, she said, seemed
to float down and through her screen door and into the room.
"They' re just really odd-looking. Their eyes. I just hate ' em. I
hate them," she said. "It's like they just look right through you ...
They go inside you," which gave her "a really weird unnerving
feeling." She avoided looking at them, because "it's hard to put in
words. It's as if I'd lose my self, and don't feel like I have any
control." Once again the beings reassured her telepathically. "I
don't think I'll ever get used to their way of doing things," Jerry
said. "I don't think I'll ever get to where I feel comfortable going
through the window." She does not like the sensation, and is curious "how they can manipulate matter, solid matter."
Jerry was frightened again as she was taken through the window into a familiar enclosure. "I know this room," she said. She
had "mixed feelings" toward the leader, whom she feels she
knows. "He talks to me. The other ones don't," but she had foreboding feelings about what would happen when he was there. As
her fear mounted I suggested a device for reducing her anxiety.
She would split her consciousness so that Jerry One, allied with
me, would observe Jerry Two in the room. Using this approach
Jerry One "observed" that Jerry Two was naked on a table, unable
to move her arms and legs, in a room lined with "lots and lots and
lots and lots" of rectangular-shaped containers, "like drawers, in a
cabinet," with "hardly any space in between." Inside of these
drawers, or "incubators" as she called them later, were hundreds
of "I don't know if you can call it babies or not, but little, just,
I guess, fetuses."
"To the far right" and "towards the bottom" was a little fetus
or baby Jerry believed was "mine." Our device was becoming
more difficult now, for Jerry found "I can't be emotionally detached ... This has been going on since I was thirteen," she said,
and estimated that perhaps fifty "procedures" involving implanting or removing something vaginally had occurred over the
years. "It goes in waves," she said. "I go for a while" and "nothing happens," and then "they come and it seems like it's all the
time." Quite a few times-she does not know how many-she recalled being taken to see what appeared to be hybrid beings.
"That's the part I hate the worst," she said. "I think of them, the
little little ones, as horses."
"Do they look like horses?" I asked.
"Just their eyes do," and "skinny, you know, long limbed," like
colts, she said. "That's how I think about them." She recalled particularly the twin girls she felt were her offspring, but does not remember being brought to see them until they were as tall as
Colin, who was now three.
Jerry believed that during the particular episode we were exploring, an embryo was placed inside her body. She thought this
because the episode was relatively brief-"those are the quick
ones." She said she has been given information from the aliens
that they take DNA from a human male-"the sperm could be
from my husband" or someone else-and combine it with an egg.
After combining the male and female germ substance, she said,
the aliens alter the embryo in some way, perhaps adding a genetic
principle of their own. This altered embryo is then reinserted into
the female body, as in Jerry on this occasion, for "gestation."
Returning to her account of this abduction experience Jerry described how the beings separated her legs "like in a regular gynecologist's office" but because she was paralyzed no stirrups were
needed. Then a long tube was inserted in her vagina and she felt
"a pinch." She said she knew this was one of the times that an
embryo was inserted into her "because I've been through this before and I recognize the routine." The leader had taken an embryo
out of one of the drawers and brought it over to her. "The other
way" (when they remove a fetus from her body) is "worse then
putting it in," for then she feels painful cramping.
Jerry related the violation she experienced during the abduction
to not wanting her husband to touch her. She was beginning, she
said, to be aware of "how I came to associate both of those, you
know ... " of how the rape like abduction experiences had interfered with her intimate life. "They' ve ruined that," she said. "I
don't know what making love is because I'm always still too
wound up in being tense and fearful of pain, and I associate sex
with pain." Then she added, "I don't think that that's their intention to ruin my sex life." Before concluding our exploration of
this episode I asked Jerry if there was anything else she recalled.
"I wish you wouldn't ask that," she said and added, "I don't like
it when they touch me. They touch me all over ... Sometimes
they do their little feely touchies, and I just like block that out
too ... I'm just connecting from when my husband touches me,
just anywhere, I just push him away ... It's not because I don't
love him. I love him, and I just never knew what it was. I never
understood it . . . I just feel so bad," she said, "He's a very, very
loving person, and he loves to be held and touched and I can't do
that. I'm afraid to be touched. I just want to know what it feels
like to be comfortable with that."
We worked further to distinguish the seemingly coldly analytic
procedures of the alien beings from her husband's loving, caring
attention. "They' re just doing what they have to do with no respect for my feelings, and he has total respect for my feelings,"
she said, but "I kinda just react the same way." Until now it has
sometimes felt "wonderful" to say no to her husband because it
felt as if she was somehow stopping the aliens through him. "I'd
probably cry for days and days and days," Jerry said, if she could
enjoy being held lovingly by her husband. We talked further of
her loneliness and her hunger to be held and touched, "safe,
warm, kinda like when my mom used to hold me. Boy, did I used
to love that. I haven't let that happen in a long time ... They're
coming between us," she said.
An "alienation of affection," I observed, which delighted her.
I asked Jerry if she wanted to report anything further from this
episode. She described being taken down a dark corridor to another tiny room with a table she was pulled onto by the alien
hands despite her resistance. After several beings stared at her
"midsection" she became paralyzed again and they did some painful poking of her feet, right arm, and right hand. The "tall one"
came over to her and she felt gratitude toward him, for he helps
her by reassuring and touching her, "sometimes on the shoulder
... I don't mind him touching me," Jerry said, but "I don't like
it when he looks in my eyes because it goes like inside me. It's
just too ... "
"Too what?"
"I don't know. It's like someone just crawled right inside you
and knew everything about you ... I just kinda lose myself, and
he kinda just gets in there and I just don't like it."
"Is there a way that you do like it?" I asked.
"Yeah, sometimes I guess I do," Jerry replied. "It's just kind of
like I get ashamed about it because it's a sexual thing ... It's not
me. It's him," she added, "and there's no controlling it."
As Jerry's feet were being poked with needles, she was asked
to look at a screen close up .. to her face that seemed like a TV
monitor. She was angered to see that on the screen were home
movies showing her dancing with Colin. One of the beings was
staring at her, observing her reactions to witnessing this intimate
family scene. She became angry over this blatant invasion of privacy. At this point Jerry noted that there was some sort of machine on one of her toes, making it numb. This was the one that
had a mild nonalignment like one of Colin's toes, "squished up"
and folded under. "I passed on" this "defect from my toes to
him," she noted, and the beings seemed "curious or studying"
that.
Next she said she was shown a picture or painting of Jesus in
a white robe. Again the beings wanted to study her reaction to
seeing this image, but then Jerry became sleepy and does not remember anything else. She returned to the room where her clothes
were and she slipped them on with the beings' help because she
was so sleepy. She then had a "picture" of "floating through the
big tree in the backyard and right through the window into bed,"
still feeling pain in her hand. Bob was asleep, and evidently had
been through the entire experience.
Before concluding the session, we reviewed once more the
ways that Jerry had condensed her abduction experiences with human intimacy. Her ex-husband had insisted that she must have
been sexually abused, and "we went through marriage counselors"
trying unsuccessfully to discover a human perpetrator. Jerry believed that if they had been able to discover "someone else like
my father or my stepfather" she would have had far less difficulty
dealing with her sexual conflicts. Jerry's conviction about the reality of these experiences was increased by the fact that her younger brother has the same problem as she does with physical
intimacy. "His poor wife" cries and cries, Jerry said, " 'He won't
touch me. He won't let me touch him' ... Their little girl had
something happen, I think." Her older brother's daughter told a
story of "a light in the window and in the living room is where
the monsters come in."
At the end of the session Jerry said, "I really do think that they
do exist. They are real, and they are interacting with us, obviously
not in any form that we' re used to ... There's a reason they' re
doing this," she added. She feels that they are "making-whatever
you want to label it-another whole civilization." She said she
does not know "whether they're going to take it and place it
somewhere else, or it's going to be introduced here." Jerry, like
many abductees, has dreams of the world as we know it coming
to an end and relates her breeding role to this eventuality.
We scheduled a fourth relaxation session for five weeks later,
July 1, to continue Jerry's effort to "separate" affection and sexual
intimacy with Bob from the memories of her abduction experiences. Her awareness of the seeming source of the problem had
helped "a little," but she still had to "keep telling myself over and
over again" that "he's not them." Before beginning the relaxation
session Jerry and I worked out a strategy whereby we agreed that
during the session I would specifically reinforce the distinction
between traumata we might uncover that, according to her reported experience, had been perpetrated by the aliens from the
memories of her intimate contact with Bob. This therapeutic strategy appealed to Jerry, especially as family members were telling
her that she should just "accept that's the way you are" and "Bob
had started to be supportive," accepting that "maybe I'm just going to have to not want sex." We began the session by focusing
on the sexual encounter that Bob and Jerry had had on Saturday
afternoon ("I seem to be more comfortable during the day," she
explained), five days before. Colin had been asleep, and the older
children were told not to disturb them. I asked Jerry to remember
that afternoon and to report any intrusive thoughts that came up at
the time or might occur now.
"Flashes of memory" came to her from an incident at age eight
when she and several family members were returning during the
night from visiting her aunt. Jerry had fallen asleep and awoke to
discover that the car was stopped in the road. She became frightened as she reported seeing "a face in the window, it's right there,
right close," and a grayish, metallic-looking craft hovering nearby
just above the ground with "lights coming out of the bottom of
it." Her mother, who had been driving the car, one of her brothers,
and her sister seemed to be asleep. The being's face had "like
devil eyes or something." Soon Jerry found that her feet and legs
felt "like when they fall asleep" and she could not move them
while she kept hearing in her mind "It's all right." Next she felt
"like a bee bite," which caused "a funny feeling" to run down her
left shoulder and upper arm and caused her to go to sleep.
When she woke up Jerry said that she found herself lying on
her back, apparently alone, in a dark place she did not recognize.
She was so afraid that her teeth were chattering. The being she
had seen outside the car was "in my face again, just looking at
me ... He must be the devil," Jerry said, "because I just think
he's so ugly." The being told her that "he's just going to do a few
things and then I can go home." Then she felt a squeezing sensation at her throat, as if from the alien's hands, and she was afraid
that "he might kill me.', After this another being pushed her over
onto her side and seemed to be staring at her back. Although her
fear of what the beings might do was intense, Jerry felt "like I
know them ... I don't trust them," she complained, because "you
just never know what they' re going to do."
"I don't like them touching me," she said as she reported being
touched repeatedly all over the back. It felt like many "little needles" 
and "a little pinch." Her terror derived from the fact that unlike 
"going to the doctor's office when they tell you and you
know what's wrong and your mom's with you," in this situation
"I don't know what's going on, and I feel that any moment
they' re going to hurt me." Then Jerry reported that "they roll me
back over" onto her back and did a lot more "just looking." She
felt temporarily "better 'cause he's not doing anything," but "I
kinda got a feeling there's something going on behind me."
Jerry felt intense embarrassment as she told me that the leader
pushed her legs into a pulled up and apart position to "check me,
and he brings a light, this really bright light, and I'm thinking
what are they going to do. I don't like this. It's just, really, it's
okay to, you know, poke at me and everything, but I don't like
that. That's my private area, and I don't think they should be
doing anything there, and I don't think my mom would like that."
At first they were "just looking" inside her vagina, but then "they
put something in there" that was "kinda like when I get older, the
gynecologist, you know, kinda like that." This procedure was
painful and Jerry screamed in terror for her mother. But "that
doesn't stop them." It was "over real quick," and after all this looking and "checking," the being who performed it looked up to the
leader and said "no" or gave some sort of negative response to a
question of his. Jerry interpreted this to mean she was not yet
ready for their reproductive procedures. This vaginal examination
seemed to Jerry to be part of an overall "checking" the beings did.
This experience was mortifying for Jerry. She felt "like a rag
doll" afterwards, "like I can't, I don't have any control over my
body." In this instance, Jerry could describe the strange, hooked
light that was put inside of her, but she was not able to recall the
actual sensations that she felt at the time. "I wouldn't know the
words like 'rape' [at age eight]," she said, "or something, but it's
like that."
I asked Jerry if she had ever known whether she had a hymen,
but she said that as a child and adolescent she did not touch or examine her genital area, perhaps, in part, because of the trauma of
this experience. Jerry was "always very modest" about her body,
and her mother would sometimes comment on this. Then I asked
her explicitly whether there had been an anal examination. She
had not intended to tell me, because "that's worse than the other"
and occurred before the vaginal exam. "I just skipped past it. I
just skipped past it," she said.
I asked what made it "worse."
"Just doing that," she said, was "totally completely disgusting"
and more uncomfortable.
At this point in the session Jerry was struck powerfully by the
ways in which her reactions to Bob's advances were patterned by
the "scenarios" of her abduction experiences. She made a circular
motion with her hand to describe the way in which her abduction
material was triggered by being touched by him and how intensely the alien and human experiences had become interwoven.
For example, when Bob touches her on the back it brings back the
touching/probing of the aliens. "When he starts with the touchfeely stuff the tape starts running in my head," she said. When he
spreads her legs prior to intercourse it brings back the memories
of the aliens pushing her legs apart on the table. The act of intercourse is equivalent in her mind to the assaultive genital probing
on the ships that she cannot stop, and when she says no and stops
Bob, it is as if she is stopping the aliens, "even though I know I
can never really stop them."
We then derived a strategy for their intimate interaction that
would maximize the distinctions between Jerry's abduction experiences and her relationship with Bob. First, they would discuss
and agree in advance that she would initiate the forms of foreplay
and intercourse after a good deal of affectionate talk and she
would have the option of stopping their encounter at any point
without guilt. She would direct Bob's touch, which would be slow
and smooth, focusing on her breasts (which the aliens do not
touch), and would contrast the rapid, needlelike touching of the
beings. She would initiate genital touching, and when Bob's penis
was erect she would mount him, take him into herself, and be the
more actively moving partner, which she assured me he would
like. At every step she would be in charge and in control.
At the end of the session I summarized for Jerry the two parts
of the strategy we had discussed-a psychological emphasis on
distinguishing in her mind between the alien and human experiences and an action strategy that would reinforce this distinction.
She looked forward to initiating the plan. I also stressed how especially traumatic the anal and genital penetration of her body that
she had experienced at age eight must have been. For at this age,
even more than at thirteen, a child has no way to understand or
consciously record such experiences, for the psyche is simply too
immature. Thus the experience becomes deeply buried in the unconscious, affecting later feelings and behavior in ways that the
person has no way to comprehend.
Five days after her last relaxation session, Jerry stopped by my
office after another appointment she had in the hospital. She
looked well and happy and said the strategy was working. Two
days later Pam called her and she said that "whatever we did was
totally successful." She tried what we had suggested with Bob,
expecting to be anxious. "But it didn't show up at all." He did everything she asked of him, relaxed, and enjoyed her initiatives.
She is certain now that what has been upsetting her has nothing
to do with him, for otherwise their sexual activity would have
bothered her. She was elated that none of her old, disturbing feelings returned. Bob is very happy about the change. "I can't believe it," he said. Several months later, the change was still
sustained.

DISCUSSION
Jerry's case demonstrates a broad range of abduction phenomena.
She reports having experienced complex, intrusive reproductive
procedures on the alien craft, including insertion and removal of
what appear to be fetuses of some sort and has described encounters with hybrid entities. At the same time she has undergone the
intense personal growth and philosophical and spiritual opening
that often seem to accompany abduction experiences. Interestingly, her philosophical and poetic writings antedated her work
with me and cannot, therefore, be attributed to our relationship or
interaction. All three of her children, the products of two marriages, seem to be involved in the abduction phenomena.
The representation in her psyche of the hybrid babies as horses
or colts, unconscious at first, reminds us of the variety of animal
forms, including deer and different birds, in which the alien beings may appear to abduction experiencers. For Colin, the aliens
were owls from the sky. This complex symbolization may be a
product of the psyche's unconscious power of disguising threaten- -
ing elements or may be induced by the seeming mind-altering
powers of the aliens themselves. Another possibility would be that
some sort of deeper connec�on of the alien beings with the animal
spirits themselves can occur, similar to the human-animal connections that are familiar in shamanic practices.
Jerry's abduction encounters, beginning in childhood, have been
deeply traumatic for her, and their intrusive, rapelike, reproductive
and sexual elements were buried deeply in her psyche. Because
the material from these experiences remained unconscious, she
was unable to distinguish the physical aspects of human intimacy
and sexuality from her alien experience traumata. As a result,
Jerry was unable to enjoy or even tolerate physical contact with
her husband, with whom she had a mutually loving relationship.
The uncovering of core material from her abduction-related traumatic experiences, through four long hypnosis sessions, allowed
Jerry to psychologically separate human from alien reproductive
and sexual activity and pennitted us to devise strategies for reinforcing the distinction between them. Jerry and Bob were then
able to enjoy a satisfying sexual relationship.
It is difficult for someone who has not been present during
these hypnotic regressions to appreciate the emotional intensity of
the traumatic experiences an abductee like Jerry has undergone.
He{ verbal expressions of rage and outrage and bodily writhings
are something to behold. But over and above these abreactive expressions, which pennit the integration of the traumatic memories,
Jerry's case also illustrates well the other dimensions of abduction
trauma-the lifelong personal isolation, the philosophical disbelief, and the fact that new episodes may befall the experiencer and
his or her children at any time. Jerry is particularly eloquent in
speaking of this last element. She concluded a poem titled "Regression," written during the winter of 1992-93, with the lines,
"This wonderful technique gives relief to traumas past/with one
catch although, will it end with the last?/Because, unlike other
victims of rape, incest, even war trauma,/we're not relieved of our
continuing unrelenting other world melodrama."
Despite the great suffering Jerry's abduction experiences caused
her, she, like many other abductees, holds to the view that there
was something of great value, a creative dimension, "a definite
reason," for the abduction process-perhaps the creation of a new
race of beings in which she was participating. It is difficult to
know whether such ideas represent an authentic realization by the
abductee herself, are possibly implanted by the alien beings, or result from a kind of identification with the aggressor.
Jerry, like many abductees, has opened her mind and heart to
important philosophical and spiritual concerns. These are expressed most fully in her writings. In a November 1992 journal
entry she told of a dream of the future destruction of the earth
through nuclear war. That such concerns for the earth and its fate
predated our work is made clear by entries from December 1991,
six months before she called me. Writing as if she were receiving
information from another troubled and perplexed source or voice
that was speaking to her, Jerry described the beauty of the Brazilian rain forest, but followed this with the concern that "it was
dying a very slow death . . . Why was this most beautiful place
being destroyedT' she continued. "You started to investigate further and you discovered that it was not the place that was dying.
It was the inhabitants of the place that were killing it. You then
were very concerned about this and continued exploring the rest
of the earth and its inhabitants. The very same thing happened everywhere you went. You then decided something must be done.
But what? How? ... Does humankind have that much hatred for
his future that he would destroy it?" she wondered.
Jerry's writings include consideration of a vast range of existential matters, including the nature of time, space, and the universe
itself; the great cycles of birth, death, and creation; the mysteries
of truth, spirit, and soul; and the limitations of material science.
She believed that she was to write a book about Universe, Soul,
God, and Eternity based on the ideas that were coming to her and
organized her communications into chapters. Sometimes she
seemed to pause in awe before the power of the information she
was receiving and the implied responsibility that accompanied it.
In a December 1991 entry she wrote, "But why would you pick
an ordinary housewife to do such important work as this? And
who is going to understand and even buy the book?" The answer
she received was that she had chosen this role herself.
In an entry dated November 22, 1991, Jerry wrote from the
standpoint of the archetypal creative force of the universe. "Imagine that your essence, your soul, was part of a whole, and as part
of a whole you decided to give birth, to create. You then gave
birth to your thought to create and made your thought into matter.
As this birth came to be solid, you then decided you would continue to create, and after some time you decided you would like
to be whole again. But in order to be whole again you had to
gather up all of the fragments or pieces of your whole being. In
order to become whole again you must be able to then understand
that you have to then create and give birth to that thought. And
in order to go back to your original form you must again reverse
the process." She then likened this process to "the union of a man
and a woman. The two give thought to create a baby. Their
thought then becomes matter in the form of a baby."
A number of Jerry's writings are concerned with the relationship of the material world to the spirit world and the limitations
of a purely technical or technological way of knowing. For example, in a November 1991 entry she wrote, "Technical data does
not lead to the discovery of other beings. Spiritual data does." A
month later she wrote:
Science: manifested travel into space and time
Spirituality : unmanifested travel into space and time
Science: limited travel
Spirituality : unlimited travel
Both valid
Which ticket will you buy ?
Jerry has shown a great deal of courage and determination in confronting the disturbing power of her abduction experiences in the
face of the community of disbelief that has surrounded her. She
has also developed a marked increase in her ability to know her
own mind, and think for herself despite or because of her isolation. These qualities were captured in a poem she called "Decision," written in the winter of 1992-93. She wrote of her battle to
overcome her fears and the secrecy and silence that had always
oppressed her. She had chosen, she said, to "no longer" let her abduction experiences "take all of me ... At least I will have the
dignity," she concluded, "of knowing and owning my own memory."

CHAPTER SEVEN. IF THEY WOULD EVER ASK ME

Catherine was a twenty-two-year-old music student and nightclub
receptionist when she called me for help in March 1991 after an
episode a few weeks earlier that puzzled her. One night in late
February she had completed work at about midnight and started
for home. But oddly, instead of stopping at her home in Somerville, near Boston, she kept driving in a northerly direction, explaining to herself, "I guess I'll go for a drive" and that she would
"put some highway miles" on her new car. When she returned
home there was a forty-five-minute period for which she could
not account.
The next day Catherine awoke at about noon, "flipped on the
news," and saw "something about the UFO seen last night." Some
of the news commentators tried to explain the object seen over
Boston as a comet or a meteor, but according to the reports the
object traveled horizontally in relation to the treetops and Catherine said to herself, "That's an unusual meteor kind of thing," and
"a comet comes down out of the sky and smashes and that's it."
Also, a policeman and his wife reported that the object had
stopped overhead and shone a light down on them. One of the TV
channels showed a chart of the object's path from southern Massachusetts to the northeastern part of the state (Barron 1 99 1 ;
Chandler 1991 ). Catherine then realized with shock that although
she did not recall seeing the UFO, "I was traveling the same direction as it was." Ironically she had recently been reading about
UFOs and "halfway hoping to see one and halfway hoping I
don't." Also troubling to Catherine and contributing to her contacting me was an unexplained nosebleed-the first she recalled
in her life-that she said occurred shortly after the above episode,
and the fact that she had found herself answering positively to
most of the questions indicative of possible UFO encounters in a
book about abduction experiences.

"All beings in the tank were identical. The frames of the tank were
flush with the wall," according to Catherine, who in this drawing depicts herself accompanied by two beings.

In our first session Catherine was apologetic, fearing that she
was wasting my time. She recalled a dream from age nine in
which she was paralyzed and terrified as "some kind of creature"
with long fingers, larger at the ends, came up behind her and
grabbed her. The creature's hand felt cool. In her terror Catherine
wanted to scream and "call for my mother, but I can't. I can't say
anything." She also remembered another dream from the previous
Christmas, 1990, when she was home visiting her mother in
Alaska, in which she was in a spaceship with curved walls and
there was something in the room she was in that was "like a big
fish tank." She was not certain that this really was a dream. I did
a light relaxation exercise with her to help her recall details of the
nighttime drive. Catherine described the roads she had traveled
and felt fear as she recalled driving twice through a wooded area
in Saugus, about ten miles north of Boston. She also described a
considerable fear of needles. Finally, she noted that she was in
somewhat of a career crisis, feeling that "I'm not using all of-the
skills that I have."
Catherine· and I both felt that this first meeting-which in retrospect was suggestive of UFO abduction experiences-was
equivocal, and I suggested that she see if other material surfaced
in the days to follow and asked that she call me in about a week.
When she did not call, I called her and she said that she felt foolish calling me back, that nothing more had surfaced, and that she
was busy filling out resumes to move on in her career. I did · not
hear from Catherine for nine months, after which she wrote me a
letter saying that she now had "impressions (memories is too
strong a word)'' from Christmas 1990 "of a ship in the field" behind her mother's house in Alaska. Also, she had become panicky
watching the movie Communion, based on Whitley Strieber 's
book; described seeing an odd light in a cloud moving across the
horizon six months before; and discovered a small straight scar
under her chin for which she could provide no explanation. All in
all she was "wondering about it too much to let it all go" and had
decided that "I would like to see if anything can be brought to
light simply for my own peace of mind."
Over the next eight months I did five hypnosis, or relaxation,
sessions with Catherine and talked with her frequently. In our sessions several of her abduction experiences were explored in detail
and extremely powerful emotions emerged. Catherine has attended
our monthly support group regularly and has become an important
support person for other experiencers. She has, indeed, changed
careers and is currently attending graduate school in psychology.
Catherine's case is significant for the clarity of observation that
she brings to many of the UFO abduction phenomena. But in addition she demonstrates the ways in which personal growth and
transformation of the phenomenon itself may occur as a result of
a shift in the attitude and approach of the experiencer to the encounters, especially in relation to the terror associated with them.
Catherine grew up in Oregon in towns in and around PortlancL
moving frequently because of her father's work as a surveyor. He
became disabled with back problems when she was a child, and
was reduced to doing repair work and carpentry around the house
and odd jobs for other people. He also had a drinking problem;
would disappear frequently when drunk; and was given to impulsive, angry outbursts. Once when Catherine refused to clean her
room she says that he put all of her belongings in a Dumpster and
burned them. Her parents were divorced when Catherine was in
college. She has virtually no contact with her father now.
Catherine's mother, Susan, is a teacher and works with handicapped children. When Susan was in college she says she saw a
UFO ("lights in the sky that do things that planes don't do") that
was witnessed by about three dozen other people. Susan, concerned about her daughter and curious about my work with her,
called me from her home in rural Alaska, where the family had
moved during Catherine's teenage years. I was impressed with her
sensitivity and openness to Catherine's experiences. She expressed
a belief in the possibility of life beyond this planet that might take
unexpected forms. Catherine's only sibling, her brother Alex, is
eight years younger than she. Catherine believes he may have had
abduction experiences but doesn't know it. She says he had an unexplained mark on the side of his left hand that has the same
horseshoe shape as two scars Catherine has on her left hand that
she believes are abduction-related. This mark has since disappeared.
Susan describes Catherine as having been "a free spirit, a little
different" growing up. Searching for other sources of trauma, I
asked Catherine about childhood sexual abuse, rape, and other
possible violations. She told me that when she was about four a
childhood friend of the family put his hand between her legs and
touched her genitals. This was a disturbing experience-"here's
this old guy that I thought was absolutely wonderful and I trusted
so much, that my parents loved too, and it was like-I was shattered." Neither Catherine nor her mother believes that she was
sexually or physically abused by her father or other family members.
The first abduction experience that Catherine recalls occurred
when she was three years old. The memories were consciously
triggered-i.e., remembered · without hypnosis-by a disturbing
nightmare scene in the first episode of the CBS miniseries Intruders in which one of the women abductees sees a barking dog at
her bedroom window that "turns into" or masks the memory of an
alien being. Catherine says she remembered waking up in the
middle of the night and seeing a being at her bedroom window
with blue light coming into the room from behind it. The family's
home was a one-story mobile home, and Catherine calculated that
"this funny-looking guy outside the window" would have to be
quite tall or floating because the window began several feet above
the ground and the entity's thin torso could be seen in the window.
She described the being as having "huge black eyes, a pointed
chin-his entire head is like a teardrop inverted. He's got a line
for a mouth, nose I can't see totally well from where I am, but it's
not like a human nose. It's just a bump. I can see nostrils, but not
as large as ours are. He doesn't seem to be wearing any clothes.
He doesn't really seem to have any color to him. He's got a bluish
cast to him caused by the light coming from behind him. It's like
he's backlit somehow."
The being in the window appeared to come through it and "materializes at the end of the [blue light] shaft." When '1he beam
came in and hit the floor," Catherine says, "I' ve got this impression of floating above my bed, like kind of being levitated out the
doorway to the hall." Catherine experienced terror at that time and
in our interview. "It's like monsters are coming to get me. But
they're real. There's nothing I can do about it ... I was crying out
for my mom right then, and I was trying to scream for her to
come but I couldn't move. The words wouldn't come."
Catherine sensed that when she tried to scream for her mother
the beings did something to reduce her terror, which seemed to diminish after she started floating. After this Catherine saw five
or six beings similar to the one in the window "in the living
room moving around really fast, and I'm not sure what they' re
doing ... They' re like picking things up and looking at them, and
putting them down again." After the busy rushing around "it
seems suddenly [the beings] all got organized again, and they're
all in a line. All the activity has stopped. The living room was
very light [' . . . it's definitely got a bluish tint to it ... '], but it
was in the middle of the night and there wouldn't have been any
lights on." Catherine reported that she was floated "literally
through" the front door, face first, and saw that "outside it's light
too. It's the middle of the night, but it's light." In the field outside
her home "there's like a ship," and "it seems like a lot of light is
coming from it, but there's more light than it would put out."
(Catherine's mother later told her that the trailer park had large,
blue flood lights.) The ship has a "disc shape. It seems like it's
got a lot of lights all over it, but I'm not sure if that's right."
Our discussion of this episode ended at that point, but, as is
characteristic of abduction narratives, Catherine recalled many
more details in the weeks that followed. Three and a half months
after the above interview she told me more about this episode in
a letter. She reported having a clear image of one of the beings in
the living room "picking up a teacup, holding it a few inches
from his face, peering at it intently, and putting it back again."
She says she remembered being floated "in front of him [the being that had been in the window] and out the door of my room
to the hall, to the living room," and then "out the front door."
Catherine then described what she had experienced on the ship,
which we had not explored in our previous discussion:
They take me into a round room in the ship with a long
bench around the perimeter, except for the doorway. The bench
had a red cushion all along it. There are other kids in there,
maybe five or six, all under ten years of age. A taller, female
being enters and says to me, "Do you want to play?" I get the
feeling from her of a nursery school teacher, or a day care center leader. I'm sleepy and confused, but I say, "Okay." She
seems pleased with this answer. I look at the other kidsthey're older and taller. The room seems very bright. She goes
to the other side of the room, where she came in, and brings
back something. I think it's a metallic ball, and it floats. She
flies it around the room doing loop-the-loops, etc., and some of
the other kids are trying to fly it, but not as gracefully. They hit
the walls, and it makes a metallic "clang" when it hits. There's
a feeling of amusement from her when this happens. It gets to
be my turn, and she says, "Would you like to try it?" and I say
"Yeah!" because I want to show up all , the bigger kids. She
gives me a metallic rod, about a foot long, or maybe a little bit
longer. It's about an inch in diameter, and there's a thick, short
antenna coming out of the top. It's silver/gray, and smooth. The
antenna is about four inches long, with a small ball at the end.
The rod is like a remote control, and you point it at the ball to
guide it, but you have to concentrate at the same time to control
it. So I make it stop, hover, then go and come to a dead stop
after moving very fast, and am doing it much better than the
older ones were. The older kids who did badly are giving me
glaring looks, and I get a sense of frustration from them. The
female being comes to take the rod away after a minute, since
my turn is over, and when she does, she tells me that I did very
well, but I have to stop because I'm making the other kids feel
bad because I'm younger and they didn't do as well. There's a
feeling of specialness-Qf my being special to her because I did
so well, and am so little, and she's proud of me because I
did better than I was supposed to. There are a couple more kids
who get their turn, and then she takes the ball and rod back to
where she got them. She comes back and says to us all,
"You' ve done very well. We're very pleased with all your individual progress." I feel proud of myself.
Yes, there is more to this story, but this is all I have, so far.
The next encounter Catherine has reported occurred at age seven
and was recovered unexpectedly in our third hypnosis session in
which the regression was open ended-i.e., we were not seeking
information about a specific episode. Th� session began with her
experiencing herself walki ng with two friends to their house
carrying a big box of candy. She was wearing a Camp Fire girls
uniform. A finger on her left hand hurt and had a funny-shaped
blister on it, which made carrying the box more painful. As we
talked about how the three girls and the friend's mother went from
house to house selling the candy, an image of a woman who kept
peacocks, and of the alley where they were kept, came into Catherine's mind.
She then described an event a week earlier when she was at
one of the friend's houses and felt strangely drawn to leave and
go down this alley to see the peacocks. It was rainy and the alley
was muddy. Catherine was afraid the lady would come out of her
house and yell at her, "because I know I'm not supposed to be
there." She was throwing rocks at them to make the peacocks'
beautiful feathers come up when she reported seeing "a little
white thing." This turned· out to be "a little man standing there.
He looks startled. He has a big head, big eyes, and he doesn't
have any hair." He told her that he wanted to take her somewhere,
but she felt she should not go because her mother had told her
"I'm not supposed to go with people I don't know and I don't
know him." The figure told her it was okay, but she felt afraid and
angry, "because I told him I don't want to go and he's going to
take me anyway." She tried to run away, but the being had "his
hand on my ann" and she could not get away. Catherine began to
cry in the session like a helpless child, and repeated plaintively, "I
don't know him and he's going to take me anyway! !"
Still crying Catherine said, "He's taking me up. We're flying
up ... I can see everything down. It's scary. It's not supposed to
happen. He's still got his hand on me. I can see everything below
me and it's not supposed to be like that." After this she passed
through a "hole" into "the middle of this room." Catherine
thought of hitting the little figure, which was "as tall as I am," but
she "couldn't move at all." He seemed to laugh. "He thought it
was funny that I wanted to hit him," which she could tell "because I kind of heard him in my head." Inside the room the "little
man" went to another room to get something and bring it back. "I
said, 'What are you going to do with that?' And he tells me, 'I'm
just going to make a little cut. ' I say, 'Why? ! ! ' And he said, 'Because we aeed a sample.' I said, ' NO ! ! NO!! You can't cut me! ! '
and he said, 'We have to. ' I said, 'No, you don't have to!! That's
mean ! ! You don't have to do it to me !!' He said, 'It's for scientific
research. ' I said, 'Well, why can't you cut something else?' He
said, 'Because we need blood.' " He made a little cut on the
fourth finger of her left hand, which hurt less than Catherine expected. With an instrument like an "eyedropper kind of thing"
made entirely of metal, he drew in a small amount of blood.
Insisting that "we had to get the sample," the being said he
would take her back. "But you didn't tell me why," Catherine insisted. "He said, 'I'm researching your planet. ' I said, 'What's
wrong with my planet?' He says, 'We're trying to stop the damage. ' I said, 'What damage?' He saicL 'The damage from pollution. ' I said, 'I don't know about that. ' He said, ' You' ll learn. '
And then we' re going down again. I'm getting closer to the
ground, getting closer, getting closer, and I'm on the ground, and
I want to run away but I can't move. He says, 'We'll be back for
you.' "
Once again Catherine found herself in the alley where the peacocks were. "I'm running and running, past the peacocks, running
up the street," until she ended up "where I'm supposed to be
now." Catherine calculated that perhaps fifteen minutes had
passed, and no one seemed to have missed her when she rejoined
a group of children watching cartoons on television at another
friend's house. The details about what had just happened to her
seemed to fade quickly. Perhaps "I blocked it out," Catherine suggested. By the time she got to her friend's house "it was already
fading." When she went back in the house "I thought I was just
outside." It appears that the pain to her finger caused by carrying
the large candy boxes was the entry point to the memory of the
abduction episode which had occurred a week earlier. A small
horseshoe-shaped scar remains on her ring finger to this day for
which Catherine has no other explanation than the incident above.
The next episode that Catherine relates to the UFO phenomenon occurred when she was fifteen or sixteen. It involves unexplained lights on the hillside behind the mobile home where she
was living with her mother, father, and brother. No abduction experience seems to have occurred. When Catherine and Susan were
driving back to their home they said they saw "little lights" moving parallel to each other, close to the ground. Her mother pulled
the car over and they watched for a few minutes as the lights, according to Catherine, did "strange things" that a plane would not
do. Although once in the house Susan seemed to lose interest, she
did suggest, "Maybe it was a UFO," and recalled her own sighting from her college days. Still fascinated, Catherine continued to
watch through the window a complex movement of three or four
lights on the hillside "all dancing around up there." At one point
they all swooped down at once, but Catherine could not get her
mother to take an interest in the phenomenon. "I said, 'Mom!!
What's coming down off the hill?!' "

Although inconclusive, this experience seemed to epitomize
Catherine's feelings of aloneness and isolation in relation to the
UFO/abduction phenomenon. This feeling was reinforced for her
by her sense that her mother "thinks it's my imagination." She .
longed to leave her "total hick town in the middle of nowhere,"
hoping that "maybe stuff like this won't happen if I'm in a city."
Without the support of anyone else, Catherine wondered, "These
lights. It could have been ... who knows ! It could be my imagination."
The Christmas "dream" of 1990, to which she had referred in
our initial meeting, turned out to be the first adult abduction experience that Catherine was able to recall. The story unfolded in
our first two hypnotic regressions. Her mother's mobile home is
in a deserted area six to eight miles from a small town in south
central Alaska. There are large fields behind the house. Christmas
day fell on Tuesday and Catherine remembers that the "dream"
occurred a day or two later. Before the hypnosis she recalled
awakening the next morning with an "image in my head of being
in a room in a ship ... I spent about ten minutes just lying in bed
trying to remember everything about it that I could and bum it
into my memory as much as possible. I know it was very important to remember it. I didn't know why. Part of me was saying it
was just a dream; it's no big deal. But part of me was saying, no,
this is very important. You need to remember as much as you can
about this." Catherine thought about the dream the entire day to
see if she could remember any more about it but could not at that
time. Later she recalled the details mentioned at the beginning of
this chapter.
Under hypnosis we reviewed in great detail the layout of the
home, Catherine's arrival before Christmas, her father's visit on
Christmas Eve, and the quite uneventful activities of Christmas
Day and the day following. Now as she recalled awakening with
the impression of having seen "a ship" she felt that "it didn't really seem like a dream." She also felt "a little bit nervous" in the
session. I encouraged her to "stay with the nervousness" and reassured her of her present safety. Then she said, "I can remember
walking down the hall in the middle of the night and looking out
the window in the living room and seeing a big ship out there,
back in the field." Catherine believes she was in a "more than half
asleep" state at this point. The field was like a frozen swamp in
the winter, and the craft was "sitting on the ground" between the
trailer and several large trees. "It's like a discus, but wider in
the middle than a discus is and silvery metal. It's bigger than the
trailer." She also noticed individual lights all around the rim of
the craft ("white lights, kind of in a groove," she observed after
the session). Her first reaction was, "It shouldn't be there."
Catherine's anxiety in the session began to mount. Wearing
only "a big stretched out T-shirt" and with bare feet, "I can see
myself going through the living room to the front door and putting on my mom's big heavy boots and one of her big heavy coats
and going outside." Gasping now Catherine said, "I feel like I
know I open the door and go outside. I don't want to open the
door." I acknowledged her anxiety, offered support, and allowed
her to choose whether to continue to report her experiences.
Bravely she decided, "I'll do it. I see snow and it's dark . . . I'm
just standing there with the door open, looking out at the snow.
It's dark ... That's what I see. My mom's car is out there. It's to
the left." In the session Catherine began to relive feeling numb,
with pressure in the chest. Beginning to sob and pant Catherine
said, "I 'm starting to feel numbness in my face now. My arms are
starting to feel really heavy. Numbness is moving down to my
hands. I'm feeling a very heavy weight on my chest and stomach.
My knees are starting to feel numb now too . . . like Novocain
numbness," she said later.
After standing for a short while in the doorway Catherine said
that she started to go out of the house "to the ship." But she had
difficulty doing so as "my entire body feels totally numb." She
noticed that "there are creatures out there" by the ship. I asked her
to describe them. "There's five of them, and it doesn't look like
they have any clothes on. They should have clothes on because
it's Alaska It's the middle of the winter and it's cold." The creatures were "exactly the same size. They're standing in a row ...
They' re kind of glowing, golden glow. They light up a little bit
the snow around them ... They have very big heads." She felt "in
my head" that the beings were "waiting for me," and despite
numbness in her arms and knees, she walked haltingly most of the
way to the ship, describing these moments with panic-filled sobbing that required a great detail of comforting from me. As she
got closer to the ship the beings "come around me in a semicircle.
I'm trying to look at them and I can't. I can't see the faces. Their
arms are very long. They don't seem to have any body features
like we have. No nipples, no bellybutton, nothing." They apparently had no hair or evident teeth and the faces were expressionless.
Then Catherine declared, "I know I went in there but I can't go
in there," meaning she could not face in the session what happened next. She described a metal ramp, angled at forty-five degrees, "sectioned to make one big ramp." At this point in the
session it was clear that Catherine's terror had mounted to a point
where she could not continue her story. I spoke to these feelings,
encouraged a breathing and relaxation process, and gave her the
choice of going no further that day. She said, "I don't feel that I
can. I'm feeling a huge weight on my chest Everything is going.
I'm totally afraid to even think about going inside." After further
acknowledgment of her fear, I suggested a trick or game we might
play in which she would stand at the base of the ramp and send
an imaginary puppet-spy with his eyes closed up the ramp into the
ship with instructions to open his eyes upon our command and report back to her what he saw. She agreed, and the "spy" reported
"a small, oval entryway and the walls come down, curved on the
side-like being on the inside of a big egg. Everything is metallic." The puppet could tell there were other rooms, but could not
"see any entrances or anything."
Catherine was then willing to go into the ship "on her own."
She thought that she kind of "glided up the ramp." She noted further details of the curved walls and shape of the first room, which
she called ')ust an entry hall." There was light but "not a specific
lamp or anything." She saw an oval opening to another room and
said, "I'm going to go in that room but I haven't yet," and added,
"You can send a spy into that room. I'm not going to go into that
room. I'll look at the room but that's it." I agreed to this, but encouraged her to place the spy more under her agency or control
than before. She said, "He's invisible and nothing can happen to
him and they don't know he's there." He was also "a kid," a boy.
In the room the spy saw "lots of panels and instruments and
scientific things, but they don't look like things we have here.
There's kind of like a platform thing in the middle of the room.
It's not that huge. It's maybe half the size of your living room
downstairs, and you can still see the curve of the outside of the
ship like in the other room ... There's just calm. There's a thing
on the ceiling above the people there in the middle of the room.
It looks like it's on long hinges like· desk lamps like we have here
that you clamp on and you can move them around. And there's
another being in here. He's waiting, and I think he's like the doctor or the medical examiner kind of guy. And there's all kinds of
instruments and buttons and panels everywhere along the walls.
There's almost kind of counters along the walls except for the entryway ... The table in the middle is like solid, not like a table
with space underneath it, but attached to the floor and it's like one
big solid kind of block."
She seemed to feel calmer now, which appeared to correspond
to a shift at the time of the experience. Wearing ')ust the T-shirt
and boots. I don't think I have the coat," Catherine experienced
being "floated" into this room and "I know I' m supposed to get
on the table." Feeling confused, Catherine noted that this "doesn't
now feel that surprising," suggesting that the experience might be
familiar to her. "They make me lie down, but I don't want to lie
down. I feel something coming ... The doctor guy comes over
and looks at me ... medical curiosity. I'm a specimen, not like a
friend, not like someone you know ... I think something bad is
going to happen."
At this point Catherine wanted to stop the narrative and we
agreed to do so. Before ending the regression we talked further
about this material. She thought she might have seen her mother
on the ship in a previous abduction experience. She described the
small, very thin necks of the five beings she saw in addition to the
doctor. "You wouldn't think that they could support their big
heads. Their bodies are actually kind of frail." They seemed to be
wearing no clothes, and the skin was "kind of whitish, like
pale . . . When they came in with me they went to different stations in the room, like they had different things to do."
After the session Catherine debated the reality status of the experience. "I thought I was making it all up until I started crying.
I still don't remember it like a real memory, as in I remember I
went to work yesterday ... Oh, God," she exclaimed. "The idea
scares me ! Obviously! ... Well," she added, "I'm willing to admit maybe it's really not all my imagination. My reactions to
other things make more sense if this happened. I'm not, like, a totally irrational person, which is kind of a relief! It doesn't seem
like a dream. It seems more real than a dream, but not as real as
me talking to you." Then she added, "I can't see why it [i.e., making up such a story] would benefit me emotionally or psychologically. I can't see any reasons why it would," an observation
which expresses a central aspect of the debate over abduction experiences. Playing the devil's advocate I suggested that such experiences -might make her a more interesting, dramatic, or exciting
person. She objected that "if I had this wonderful experience, who
am I going to tell about this that's not going to look at me like
I'm a total kook?" In order to "calm myself down," Catherine
noted, "I tell myself, 'it's your imagination.' "
A kind of decisive indication to Catherine that she was dealing
with something that was in some way real was the power and authenticity of her emotions, for which we could find no other
source. "I don't think I would be sobbing for no apparent reason
if there wasn't something there. I'm not given to bursts of tears
for no reasons." Also persuasive to her in this initial material was
the sense that she was compelled against her will to get up in the
middle of the night and go out in the Alaskan winter toward the
ship. "I did not choose to get up and go do that." The experiences
themselves gave her a feeling of being "totally violated. It's what
I would imagine a rape victim would feel like." Finally, I noted
another quality to the tears, a kind of sadness. She suggested selfpity, but I thought it might be something deeper. Affirming then
her feeling of what I have come to call ontological shock (the realization that one's conception of reality does not hold), Catherine
said, "I get the point-of having to realize!! Oh, God."
For support at her next hypnosis session Catherine brought a
young woman friend from the nightclub where she had been
working. A sticking point in her mind, which has never been resolved, was whether or not she was wearing her contact lenses
during the Christmas, 1990, episode. She does not remember putting them in, but, remarkably, could see adequately throughout the
experience, whereas without her lenses "everything would basically have been a big blur." Catherine had remained frustrated
since the last session about having no definite answer regarding
the reality of her experience. Without concrete physical evidence,
she, like so many experiencers, felt non-validated by science and
society and in danger, therefore, of being looked at as "insane." If
she had been raped, she remarked, "I could go to the police.
There would be evidence there. They could take samples, and
people would not look at me like I had lost my mind if I said to
them, 'This happened to me.' "
She began the second relaxation session by briefly reviewing
the steps leading to being forced to lie on the table. She noted the
muted lighting in the room and again felt the loss of any will of
her own. The leader or "examiner," though taller than the others,
was still not as tall as she is. His skin seemed "very smoothwhitish, gray," and he seemed not to be wearing clothes. "He's
looking at me like you look at a frog before you dissect it." Looking around the room Catherine observed that everything was metallic, "like brushed aluminum but darker." Other beings were
moving about, seeming to perform various "specific jobs" like
"pushing levers and buttons and checking thi ngs and getting
things ready." Their movements were "very light, kind of like
when you think of a cat. It's very graceful and lithe."
Cathenne became increasingly distressed, panting and crying,
as she described how one of the beings spread her legs apart on
the table and the examiner stared at her face and genitals. She
noted that she had no clothes on. The examiner "says something
to the one on my right, and the one on the right goes off to the
right side of the room to get something, and the examiner puts his
hand on my leg, on my thigh, and it feels cold-not like human
cold hands. I mean, it's even colder. I don't .like it, and the other
one comes back and he hands the instrument to the examiner."
With a lot of support from me Catherine spoke of how she was
unable to resist. "He's doing this to me and I can't do anything
about it," she sobbed pitifully. "He's got his hand on my left
thigh, and he's taking this with his left hand. It kind of looks like
a cone, but with something else on top, and he's going to put it
in me," she sobbed loudly. Her voice breaking, Catherine continued. "He puts it in. It feels cold. It's even colder than his hand.
I can feel something going up inside me farther and farther. It
feels like something's going up in the intestines, up so far. That's
how far it feels like it's going." Although the instrument seemed
to be pushed up "way farther" than the vagina, "It doesn't hurt.
It just feels like it shouldn't be there. They didn't even ask me ! !"
As she felt the instrument being moved about on her right side
in the region of the ovary for what she estimated to be ten or fifteen seconds, Catherine had the sense that "it's taking samples."
After the instrument was retracted, the examiner gave it to an "assistant" who "takes it away to where he went to get it before." Although she said she did not see anything definite, Catherine had
the strong impression that "tissue samples" were taken from "the
uterus lining," the cervix, and perhaps the fallopian tubes.
After this I asked Catherine if she had experienced anything
else being done to her body on this occasion and took a kind of
"inventory." She described a metal instrument, "maybe a foot
long," that was inserted perhaps "six inches" into one nostril.
Somewhat shocked, I said that would have gone into her brain.
"That's what it was supposed to do," she responded. "The examiner came around, and he had this thing in his hand and it had a
like a handle on the end. It was this long, flexible thing, and he
kind of leaned over my right shoulder and he wasn't looking at
me. He was looking at my nostril, and he put it in as far as he
could. I didn't like it because I couldn't breathe very well, and
then he hit something in the back and he just kind of pushed it,
and he pushed it through whatever it was."
Sobbing, whimpering, with her voice cracking again repeatedly,
Catherine said, "I could feel something breaking in my head.
When he pushed it through, he broke whatever it was and he
pushed it all the way through, up even farther." The procedure
was uncomfortable, but it did not actually hurt. "I'm wondering
what they broke ... I don't know the anatomy, and he broke
something to get it through, to get it into my brain. I don't know
what it was. I want to know if it's going to heal." Responding to
her worry about having "heard something snap" in her head, I
tried to reassure Catherine that I doubted any permanent damage
was done to her brain. Later Catherine commented that "I was
afraid of bone fragments in my brain." I asked Catherine what she
could see after the probe was removed. She said there was a little
blood on the instrument and in her nostril, but she could not see
that anything else was removed. The examiner gave the instru-
ment to the assistant who took it "to the far side of the room
where he came in and he does something with the instrument. I
can't see what it is."
It was at this point that Catherine qbserved that she seemed
able to see as well as she ordinarily could with her contact lenses
but did not think she was wearing them. In this context an image
came to mind of the examiner '(looking in my face. He's scrutinizing me ... It's like they' re trying to figure out what else they
need to do." I encouraged her to tell me about his eyes, which
she could see only "very, very, very vaguely" and found unpleasant. Nevertheless, she was able to report, "They're very, very
big. They're much, much bigger than our eyes, and they don't
blink, and they're kind of slanted on his head. And they' re all
black ... I can't see any pupils. I can't see the retina, no whites,
nothing. It's just all black." I asked what was so disturbing about
the eyes. "I think maybe it was because they didn't care," she replied. "Just like, scientific. A kind of curiosity. It's not looking at
me like as a person. It's looking at me as their experiment. I
mean, as yes they would care if I died because it would ruin their
experiment. Not because they care about me as a person or anyone else around me."
The feeling, Catherine said, was one of "total helplessness. I'm
scared because I know they don't care about me and I have no
control over what's happening, over what's going to happen. They
think they' re superior to us ... That's another thing I got. Total
superiority ... It wasn't even told to me or anything or, get up on
the table, like the other was. It was just the attitude." I asked if
this attitude came mainly from the examiner or from all of the beings. "From the examiner more," she replied, "but all of them."
After this, several beings let Catherine get off the table and they
took her into another room. Once again she became anxious and
saw only blackness ahead in the room, although she feels certain
that she did see something more in it. We then had the following
exchange:
JM:
Catherine:
JM:
Catherine:
JM:
Catherine:
What's causing the blackness now?
[Very softly] I don't want to know.
You don't want to know? You do want to know?
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that.
I want to know, but I think it's too scary.
What happened in there is too scary?
What I saw in there is too scary.
Deciding that she would like help, Catherine agreed to try the
game we had played last time and sent a "spy" into the room with
a flashlight which he would turn on for two seconds during which
he'd look around and report back. What the spy saw was shocking
to both of us. Along the left side of the room there were "cases"
stacked in rows reaching from the floor to the ceiling, perhaps
eight feet high. There were four or five rows from top to bottom
and eight or ten from left to right, making about forty cases in all.
"I know each case has something in it. It's all the same thing,"
Catherine said, but there had not been time to tell just what. We
gave the spy another two seconds. This tiine he saw "like creatures in there, but they're kind of deformed looking. Each one has
one of those things in it." Catherine said that she passed through
this room on the way to another place, and was now willing to
say what she saw during those few seconds with the aid of our
spy with a flashlight.
In the cases, she said, were "like baby versions of them." They
were "all in a liquid" and "all facing out" and "the cases are lit
from the back." There appeared to be nothing else in the room.
The creatures were naked and "like standing up ... When you go
buy a doll and it's in a plastic case and it's stood up like that.
That's how it is." After the regression she described the cases as
"like a window display in a toy store. They cover the entire thing
with Barbie dolls and you can see through the plastic things and
they're all standing there." At the top of each case she could see
"the edge of the water [or] whatever it is. But they're fully submerged in it. The heads are large and in the same proportion to
the bodies as the alien figures themselves. They're just like miniatures."
After passing through the room with these cases Catherine said
she was led by two of the beings along a walkway, ''curving
around to the right, like following �he edge of the ship," and
through a doorway to another room. She was still wearing only
her T-shirt. Then she entered a room that was much larger than
any she had been in before. A path went through it, also curving
to the right, but the proportions confused her. "I can see where the
edge of the ship would be on the left, but it's way far awaymaybe fifty feet away. I don't understand how it could have been
that far because the other room was only like ten feet wide and
this one is so really far away."
Catherine found herself in "a forest ... I'm confused but it's
there. It's in the room, and there's like trees and rocks and dirt
and things off to the left. I can see them from where I am. We're
not going that way. We' re going around to the right. How can I
be in the forest?" Incredulous, Catherine exclaimed, "It doesn't
make sense!" for although "there's forest all around" she could
still see the curving walls of the ship. "It wouldn't have fit. It
wouldn't work." After the regression she reflected that she
"looked way off in the distance" and "could see walls, but it
didn't make sense in context." She said that the forest even
smelled like one and contained pine trees. She estimated it was
"high schoo� gym size."
Finally, she reported being taken back to the room she had originally entered and was given back her clothes. "They take me
down the ramp, and they' re walking me back over the field and
up the little hill and to the door. They open the door and I go in
and I take off the boots and the coat and I don't think they followed me in, so I went back and got into bed and went to sleep."
Her mother seemed to have slept through the whole episode. The
"tank" on the ship Catherine had previously remembered appeared to her to be a distorted version of the liquid-filled cases in
the room that she saw on the ship.
Before bringing her completely out of the regression, I reviewed with Catherine the reality status of this material. "I don't
think it's a dream" she said, "but I don't think I was supposed to
remember. That's why it doesn't seem totally real." Also, she
added, "I don't think I want to believe it ... But I do remember
it ... It scares me to think it's real."
It was not until her third regression that Catherine seemed
ready to speak of the episode of late February 1991, in which she
said she had driven, as if under some sort of compulsion, to a
wooded area in the town of Saugus, north of Boston. It was this
behavior, whose strangeness had troubled her, that had led Catherine to contact me. The Saugus encounter is in some ways the
central abduction experience of Catherine's case. She had just
completed talking of the unexplained lights behind the family
trailer when she was fifteen, and I asked "where you would go if
you were to explore further."
She described then the drive from Somerville to Saugus, about
ten miles. "I go out on roads I' ve never gone out before. Just for
the hell of it." As she headed north "all the time I keep looking
out up at the sky and I keep thinking about UFOs. I've been
thinking about them a lot for the past few weeks. But I've been
reading a couple of books about them, so I figure that's just me,
because I've been reading the books. I keep half hoping to see
one and half way hoping I don't." She thought about what to do
about her job and whether to move to New York to distract herself, "but my mind keeps returning to UFOs." She followed signs
to the Saugus Iron Works and sat for five minutes in the parking
lot and then realized that "doesn't make sense." Becoming increasingly lost she passed through a residential section and came
to a wooded area. She felt anxious about driving through it, but
thought that that was the way back to the highway and "I have
to." Catherine assured herself that "if someone tries to jump the
car" she could speed it up and "run them over."
Catherine drove through the wooded are� but realized that was
not the way to the highway and she had to go back through. Even
more anxious than the first time, she drove through again, remarking, "I think something happened but I don't know what it
is." At this point I stopped her narrative and asked her to go back
more slowly through the experience of driving through the woods
for the second time and to tell me any feelings that come up. She
said, "I don't want to be there ... I've got to drive out ... I'm
starting to go numb again." Although "my foot is on the pedal
like steadily" and the pavement was level, the car was slowing
down. The car stopped and the numbness increased to the point
where "it's like my entire body has gone to sleep."
Although Catherine could see streetlights from outside of the
woods, it was lighter around her "than it should be." Unable even
to move her hands by then, she sensed "something coming behind
the car on the left side, the driver's side, like a light coming up
there." Something came up to the door and opened it, but Catherine "can't look at it ... There's something there. I think it's one
of them. There's a hand reaching out to get me ... It's long and
thin and very light colored and it's only got three fingers." The
figure "presses me with its hand to guide me and I get out." She
felt there was no choice. "If I had my choice I'd be speeding
the hell away from there." Then "I'm going around behind the car
and this being is kind of behind me to the right side and the car
is on my left side." She said the being had "huge, black, almond
eyes," and was "glowing." She believes that the light that came
up behind the car emanated from the glow of the being itself.
Sensing her fear the being did something, perhaps with its
"huge hand," to calm her. Although she found this "somewhat
comforting that it didn't want me to be scared," at the same time
"I don't like it to have that power over me." Catherine said the
being walked with her for a way along the road and then "it either
took me into the woods and something was there, or .we went up
and I'm not sure which one happened." Noting her confusion and
also that we were both tired, I suggested that we end the session
and she readily agreed.
After I brought her out of the hypnotic state, Catherine sobbed
softly over the helplessness she had felt and the increasing realization "that there's more truth to it than not ... I don't just start
crying." I asked Catherine to pinpoint more sharply what her deep
sadness was about. She said, "because I feel powerless, and I feel
like they can get me and do whatever they want to me practically
any time, and I can't do anything about it. And that's a very terrifying thought."
I suggested she felt, "You're not master of your own life."
She replied, "Within a very small framework, but in the grand
scheme of things I feel like I don't [i.e., have control] ... It's all
because of them," she said. "My basic idea before any of this was
'you are master of your own destiny. You are responsible for your
own awakening, for your own realization of the nature of reality!' ... I totally believed that."
The further exploration of the Saugus abduction experience
took place in Catherine's fourth relaxation session, more than five
weeks later and after she had seen the first episode of the CBS Intruders miniseries. By this time she was highly motivated to
know "everything," asserting emphatict!Ily "I think it's better to
know than not know." She was also beginning to become preoccupied with '4global concerns," by which she means how "we're
messing up the planet." These ideas, Catherine says, may have
come about from "impressions that I've overheard," or "things
that were actually told to me." Recalling the abduction experience
at age seven, which emerged in the previous session, Catherine remembered the being saying to her, " 'We need to find out about
the effects of pollution on your planet' That's made me think a
lot. It's made me wonder if it's more because they' re actually concerned about keeping the planet intact for whatever reason, keeping the planet intact so their specimens don't all die on them in
the middle of the experiment."
At the same time Catherine was also troubled about the fate of
the earth. "I think they' re right. If we don't do something immediately, it's going to be suicide for us all. I'm more concerned
about keeping myself alive and my friends alive and the rest of
the people on the planet alive because it's a fine thing to do rather
than I'm concerned about some little bastards coming and taking
me away and not messing up their experiment. Our motivations
are totally different even though the goal may be the same." She
has come to the conclusion from the aliens' "attitude" that "they
have lost all the genetic material" and are using us for their needs.
But, she added, "all the genetic experimentation is a big part of
it but it's not the entire story ... It's hard to describe, but it's a
much bigger plan than just that." But if they do not continue the
reproductive/genetic activity "then they can't proceed. But this is
just one step." · ,...
After the above di scussion Catherine determined to explore further. "I need to know about Saugus, because it's a huge, huge
thing," she said. In the beginning of the regression Catherine
briefly reviewed the events leading up to being taken from her car
in Saugus with the additional detail that when her car door was
opened she thought to herself, "Oh, Christ! It's one of them!" She
now felt that in some way her trip north was forced upon her and
"they made me think I was doing it for other reasons." With the
memory of being in a spot in the woods not far from the car,
Catherine reported what followed. "He's kind of taking me up, up
the diagonal. We just kind of fly off. We're not going straight up.
We're going across too. 'This is too fast! Why are you going so
fast? I'm going to fall off the beam! I'm going to fall down
there!!' And he just kind of says, 'No, you won't.' Everything is
speeding by on the ground and we're going up together and we're
coming to the ship."
The ship, she said, was "huge. Everyone else should be able to
see it too and I don't know why they can't. It's got lights a11 ·over
it. It's just like silver metallic, but it's got lights all over it. It's
fucking huge ... he's taking me inside. We' re in a hallway.
There's some more of them waiting. There's like four of them
now. They're pulling at my clothes ... I'm pissed off! 'Stop it!!
I'm perfectly capable of doing this myself, thank you, ' and they
kind of get an annoyed attitude." Catherine thought (she could not
speak) "some snotty comment like 'Why don't they just go rent
a porn movie.' They don't get it. They don't know what a porn
movie is. I don't think they understand the concept of voyeurism
or anything like that."
Then naked, Catherine described being led by the beings into
an enormous room "the size of an airplane hangar." Catherine was
amazed to see "hundreds of tables in here ! There's hundreds of
humans in here, and they're all having things done to them." The
beings walked her through this room where she saw rows of tables on either side, separated by perhaps five feet, with many that
were empty, and about a third to a half with human beings on
them to whom procedures were being done. She estimated she
saw between one hundred and two hundred humans in all in that
room. Under the tables she saw drawers where she believed instruments were kept.
Catherine got onto one of the tables and noted a black man
with a beard on her left. She was forced to sit up and an examination began. "They're running their little fingers down my spine
like they're counting the vertebrae in my spinal column." Repulsed by the touch she exclaimed (mentally), " 'What the hell's
that for?' 'To make sure everything's okay, ' he says. 'I could have
told you that,' " she says angrily. ''They' re feeling my anns, my
legs, my ankles, feeling my neck, my thighs." She asked more
questions about the purpose of this examination. They told her
"there may be things you don't know about." A taller being came
over and stared at her and told her that she asks too many questions, that it is good to cooperate and that what they are doing
"isn't bad. It's necessary. 'I won't try to hurt anyone.' " Although
she felt these were "bullshit answers," they made Catherine feel
calmer and a "little more accepting."
As the being stared into her eyes, Catherine felt she had no
choice but to look back. I asked what the experience was like. "I
think he knows everything about me. He knows exactly what I'm
thinking. He's answering the questions before I even think of
them," as when he told her this process was necessary "before I
even asked." Looking into the being's eyes was "scary" for Catherine, "but then parts of me are kind of beaten down. I feel just ·
calm and peaceful." In addition, she , felt the figure "wants to
know me personally. I'm trying to think, 'why, you don't care
about me as an individual.' But it's hard to think it. It's hard. It's
hard to think anything that's against what he wants me to think."
The being insisted. "No, I want to know about you. I care about
you." The struggle of wills continued. Her resistance was "making him work harder than he feels lik� he should have to." Her
mind said "bullshit" as the being tried "to tell me that he loves
me." Finally, she conceded, "Maybe he's right. Maybe I just don't
understand . . . I think maybe I was wrong for thinking that he
was lying ... I just don't understand them. That's why I think
that." She persisted with the thought that he does not know what
care means, and he responded, " 'No, we know. We just don't feel
it as intensely as you do.' "
The debate was now apparently over. "He's won, so he waJks
away. He goes around to the foot of the table. He says to me, 'Are
you ready now?' I say, 'Ready for what?' He says, 'It's time.' I
say, 'I wish you would answer something. ' And he says, 'You
shouldn't wonder so much.' He tells me they're going to take it
out and I'm thinking, 'take what out?' One brings around a cart
with like a tank on it. It's like a cylinder and it's filled with clear
liquid. He's putting my feet up and spreading my legs out, and
I'm thinking, 'Oh, God, what are you going to do?' " I urged
Catherine, who was clearly distressed, to breathe deeply and return to her center. I assured her of my presence and that the worst
was "almost over."
What followed was the most disturbing experience of Catherine's recovered abduction history and the most difficult few minutes of my work with her. As she sobbed and panted, at times
crying hysterically or expressing rage, I needed to assure her repeatedly of my presence and to express my sorrow over what she
had been through as I asked for details. My sense was that she
was determined to follow through to the end despite the fact that
she was reliving a powerfully traumatic experience.
The tall being inserted "a big metal thing" in her vagina, which
was intensely upsetting. Then he took a longer and thinner "version" of this "and put it up i nside me !" She felt that he was trying
to reach something inside her body in order to cut it off. Sobbing
forcefully she said, "Oh, God, Oh, God. He's taking it. I can feel
him cutting." With short, neutral questions interspersed by me to
elicit what she was seeing or feeling together with expressions of
support, Catherine reported, "He's cutting inside me. I can feel
it ... He's got it. He takes out this hunk ... He takes out the
thing he put in and there's something attached to the end of it. It
looks like a fetus ... I can see it." I asked how many months she
estimated it was and she replied, -"I'd say about three months but
I don't know enough to know for sure. It's about the size of a
fist."
I asked Catherine if the fetus looked human. She said, "It's
kind of hard to tell. Eyes like theirs." The examiner "seems
proud. I get this feeling [she pauses]. He takes that other metal
part out, the part that wa5 spreading me apart" and "gives it to the
little one who has the cart with the tank on it and he wheels it
away." The examiner was saying to Catherine, " 'You should be
proud of yourself, ' and I keep thinking, 'Why?' " She felt she was
used like "a glorified incubator." She thought, " ' You fucking lied
to me, you bastard! You don't care about me,' and he said, 'No,
I do. ' He says it again! I say, 'You fucking bastard. How dare
you? How could you do this to me?' He's coming over to my side
of the table and he's looking into my eyes ... I'm trying to fight
him!"
Once again Catherine was angry, crying, and very upset. "He's
trying to do the same thing to me as before. You will not do this
to me again ! You will not," she yelled. "He says, 'Why are you
resisting? Why are you making this so difficult for everyone?'
And I say, 'Why have you fucking ruined my life?' [sobbing] He
says, 'We haven't ruined it. You won't even remember it. ' I saicL
'Bullshit! I will remember it, ' and he's putting his hand on my
head and making me feel kind of ... [she stops] 'You will not do
this to me again. I will not let you.' I try to fight, but I feel like
he's winning," by which she meant calmipg her down. Again
Catherine was told that this is "necessary" and "all for the best in
the end," and "I'm saying, 'Won't you even tell me what the end
is? How do I know that?' and he says, 'We can't tell you.' I say,
'You won't tell me a goddamn thing. ' I say, 'How many other humans have you done this to?' and he says, 'It's a very large
number. ' "
Catherine felt that despite her intense effort to fight the being's
influence she was "losing it" and was positively affected by his
assurances that they care about her, are "sorry this had to hurt"
her, and "didn't mean for that [her suffering] to happen." After
more communication of "meanings" concerning the aliens' experiments, plan, or project-no word seems quite right-and further
assurances that "they' re not going to hurt me," Catherine said
simply, "You should have asked me." They also told her again
that she would not remember. I asked her how it is then that she
and I are able to recover this material and �he replied that since
they did what they needed to do it does not matter anymore. After
one last reassurance to "be calm," given as much with his eyes as
with words, the examiner left, "the little guys" took Catherine off
the table and walked her back through the room with all the tables.
Looking around at the people on the tables, Catherine felt sad
"for all" and felt "like I should try to start a riot or something but
I can't do it." They took her back to the first room she had entered where her clothes were left. "I put my clothes on, and
they' re trying to put them on me again. I'm just like, 'Please [very
annoyed] , they' re my fucking clothes. Let me put them on.' They
tried to help me, but they just ended up fumbling. They were kind
of leery of me at that point. They really don't want to aggravate
me more. They're kind of scared of me." Although in her paralyzed state, Catherine could give little expression to her feelings,
"they could feel the emotions there and they get kind of scared
because they don't feel that intensity so they really don't know
how to handle it, especially now that the taller one's not there. I
don't think they have the capability to calm me down that much
if I get upset again."
Stepping out of the ship, Catherine said, "into this empty hole,
we should go falling straight down but we don't. We go back on
diagonal ." One of the beings floated Catherine back to the passenger side of her car and walked her around to the driver's side. Ac-
. cording to Catherine, the door was still open with the keys in the
ignition, and she thought, "Someone could have stolen my car."
The door closed as if on its own-she says she is �ot clear just
how this happened-and Catherine drove out of the woods, noting
that it was then 2:45 A.M. and about forty-five minutes had passed
for which she cannot account. As she drove out of the woods,
Catherine felt anxious and also "silly." In her fear she raced
home, driving over a hundred mph ("I wanted to see how faSt my
car could go"), which also served "to get out some aggression."
Once home she went right to bed and fell asleep.
The next morning on television she said she saw and heard the
stories about a UFO or a "comet" that had followed the route she
had felt compelled to travel. She called a friend, who was seeing
a therapist to whom she told Catherine's story. The therapist knew
me and my work and arranged for Catherine to contact me. As
mentioned earlier, after our initial interview Catherine did not call
me as we had arranged. Nevertheless, I called her after about a
week when I had not heard from her.
After the regression Catherine, Pam Kasey, and I considered the
possibility that her experienced impregnation with this fetus might
have occurred during the Christmas abduction in Alaska. Arguing
against this was the fact that the fetus Catherine described seemed
too fully formed for a two-month pregnancy. Catherine described
another episode that occurred in late October or early November
1990, "which made no sense at the time." She had found herself
driving in the middle of the night on deserted roads and pulled off
the highway to a rest stop. "I was really scared to be there because, again, I was waiting for something." She said she waited
for what seemed about fifteen minutes, but does not recall anything else happening before she drove home. By Christmas Catherine said she had gained some weight, which she began to lose
following the late February abduction experience.
She recalls no other pregnancy symptoms and we have not explored the late October episode further.
We reflected again upon the reality status of this experience.
She had recently read David Jacobs's book Secret Life, which
contains stories of reproductive traumas, and wondered if perhaps
"I 'm subconsciously picking up on stuff that's there," although
she had never considered herself to be suggestible. Pam observed
that Catherine had told her before she had read Secret Life that
she thought the Saugus episode "had to do with a fetus." Then
Catherine asked herself "why," if these memories were not authentic, "would I be coming up with these bizarre, traumatic stories?" In the end Catherine felt she was left with only two
choices. Either she was "crazy" or "I don't know what else. I
mean, other than it's actually happening." .
Finally, we discussed the sincerity of the examiner's expressions of caring and affection. She could acknowledge that from
the alien perspective and commitment to their enterprise they
might feel affection as we might toward a pet animal that was being used for experiments. But to her this was "not an excuse
because they know, they know that we have more of a consciousness than that. They know what they' re doing ! They know how
traumatic it is for us and they don't give a fuck." Two days after
this session Catherine wrote me a note of appreciation for the help
she had been receiving "at a time when my foundations of reality
have been shaken."
Over the next two months Catherine wrestled with many questions concerning the physical evidence that might corroborate her
encounters, their reality status, and, above all, the shifts in consciousness that might best allow her to adapt to the phenomenon
and even, possibly, have a more mutual dialogue with the aliens.
We met on July 27, 1992, to review the ways in which her attitude had shifted, which she attributed in part to what she had
learned from talking with other abductees. She continued to report
visitations and possible abduction experiences . With regard to ­
physical phenomena, we noted a tiny lump in front of her right
ear, for which she could not account. One night in mid-July she
drew three circles on her leg to remind her to ask the aliens to allow her to see some of their writing, which, if they were to respond, would increase her confidence in the reality of her
experiences and also related to her desire for a more mutual exchange of information. But the night she drew the circles (July 15,
1992) she said she was visited again ("they came down and paralyzed me") and she was too scared to pursue her questions. As
it turned out she had an abduction experience that night (see discussion of fifth relaxation session below).
Although the reality of her experiences as she had reported
them in the sessions "is going up and up and up," she had concluded that they are "not part of the normal consciousness," i.e.,
they occur in, or reflect, a nonordinary state of consciousness. The
implication of this was that "I' ve got to change my world view
even more than I had already." She also had decided that "my reaction to the whole thing is going to determine the nature of that
particular experience ... If I am totally petrified and lashing out
at them and basically turning into a hostile animal, then that's
how they're going to have to treat me," she observed. "If I am
calm and somewhat rational," she said, "I think a lot more can be
accomplished as far as at least my enlightenment about the whole
thing."
Toward the end of mastering her fear and making herself "less
of a trapped animal," Catherine had been imagining "the scariest
thing that could possibly happen." But instead of "letting it go
crazy and having the same horrible, horrible experiences that I've
been having" she would "go along with it and not totally struggle
and fight because that just makes me out to have more control
over me, which in turn makes me notice less and get more
wrapped up in my fear and my fighting instead of being more
aware and having less physical control, less mental control where
I could actually have a dialogue with them and get a straight answer and have them show me something that would be helpful to
me or whatever." Toward the end of controlling her "animalistic"
reactions and moving "higher along the evolutionary scale," Catherine developed what she called her "no fear mantra . . . If I get
afraid for any reason, I'm just sitting there saying, 'Don't be
afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.' And it works." After several meditation sessions in which she intentionally imagined aliens
coming into her room she found that she had more control over
her fear and could calm herself down.
Recently Catherine has come to the conclusion that the aliens
are "more advanced spiritually and emotionally than we are" and
therefore "they don't have the need to be as emotional as we do."
This means that "if I'm going to get anything useful from them
I've got to deal with them on their level." This also means to her
building up a "core of inner strength." This is not "something that
they can take. It's not something that anybody can take." She does
not expect the invasive procedures to stop, but she feels she can
diminish their traumatic effect. "I 'm not totally saying," she adds,
"here's my body, do with it as you will. It's more a realization
that it is going to happen." Inviting them to "show me some of
your writing because I want to learn more about you and my part
in your whole plan" is "a totally different concept" than "screaming at them, 'Why the hell are you doing this to me, you fucking
bastard.' " Perhaps "that is something they will answer" and is
"eventually going to help them because I will be more participatory in their pi�." Catherine attributed the changes in her consciousness, "this spiritual growth, this psychic growth," to the
"major, life-shattering" impact of the abduction experiences themselves.
By the time of the July 1992 meeting, Catherine had already
noted several changes in herself which were the direct result of
her shifting attitude toward the abduction experiences and her
generally greater psychological openness. She felt that the abduction experiences themselves operated as a provocation. 'There's
got to be some experience that totally changes everything and
how you perceive everything," she observed. Catherine attributes
her capacity to take advantage of the impact of her abduction experiences to the exploratory work she=
has been doing in relation
to them.
She has noted greater intuitive abilities in relation to other people. She says she can "feel people's auras," the energy fields
around us that some especially sensitive people report seeing, and
is more sharply attuned to the emotional states of others, which
she finds "very useful . . . I can actually kind of check people if
I'm meeting someone, and I want to find out if they're giving me
a line or actually sincere and kindly in what they're saying. I can
tell what their intentions are ... This whole experience makes you
open up to so many levels," she concludes, "so many other possibilities. Everyone has these kinds of abilities, but we shut them
off because our society says, 'No, it doesn't exist,' and denies it
all. And I' m opening back to this." One of the more difficult phenomena that Catherine and many other abduction experiencers report having to deal with is a virtually constant flow of sensory
experience, especially light flashes ("staticky kinds of things," she
called these at one point), intrusions of patterned color images
(while typing, in one instance) and, to a lesser extent, humming,
buzzing, and other sounds. Gradually, these visual sensations have
diminished for her, and auditory ones have increased. The neurophysiological shifts that underlie these reported sensitivities are
unknown.
It was October 26 before we were able to schedule a regression
to explore the experiences of July 1 5. In our July 27 meeting
Catherine ·reported that she knew "something" had happened
around two o'clock in the morning, "because I had looked at the
clock." Earlier that evening, in addition to the circles she had
drawn on her left leg with a permanent marker, Catherine had also
written, "Show me some of your writing." She experienced unusual light streaming through her window ("as if someone had a
big spotlight outside the window"), and had the impression of beings in the room-"one of them coming towards me with a big
wand thing with a light on the end of it and pointing it towards
me, and that was a half-dream remembrance." She felt that her
right leg and then her entire body was becoming numb. "I tried
to scream, 'NO!' but I couldn't. The words wouldn't come out. I
couldn't get any sound out, and it came out choked like,
'AHHHHHH. ' " She seemed to be too paralyzed with fear to
completely follow her own new approach to the phenomenon.
At the beginning of the October 26 session Catherine began by
wondering if abduction experiencers are chosen because of greater
auras or energetic, vibratory fields that protect them from the consequences of "messed up childhoods." We spoke for a few minutes about the relationship of the abduction phenomenon to
greater vulnerability and woundedness in the backgrounds of experiencers. In the case of at least some abductees the experiences
seem to be affecting the energy fields or responding "to certain vibrations of a quaking soul." We also talked about the possible dimensions of reality from which the abduction phenomenon might
emanate and the various "sensory aggravations" that had occurred
in Catherine's life since our last formal meeting. She expressed a
desire to know "why all these things are happening," and we
agreed to try to seek meanings in the regression as well as the narrative of her experiences.
Just before the session was started, Catherine said that the
search for meaning seemed like "the next logical step . . . I am
past the l-am-not-insane, at least ninety percent of the time ...
and past the is-this-really-happening, and past the well-I' mconfabulating-things, and all the denial, and being absolutely terrified about it, I mean, it's the next logical progression."
In the hypnotic session, our fifth, Catherine began by
reexperiencing light streaming into her room, "like a huge searchlight," and she again heard what sounded like human voices outside her room. She tried to wake up from her half sleep state but
felt "they' re not letting me." Once again she felt the beings give
her soothing messages and she was "furious because they always
do this!" Crying she exclaimed, ''They never let me remember
anything for real and I've even asked them to." 1\vo of the beings
floated her out of the bed, "putting me into the beam." She told
them not to hurt the cat, who was "hiding" after "zipping upstairs" to get away. Catherine felt that the intense control the be-
ings imposed upon her was to keep her from fighting back. She
believes her opposition "makes them very nervous."
Catherine said, "If they would ever ask me about anything that
they wanted to do, maybe I would be more willing, and even
though I've been trying to be less scared, and try to get them to
talk to me more, they still really don't want to. And I try to ask
them questions that I think that they will answer, aud I still get the
same run around bullshit answers." Nevertheless, she said that
during an abduction experience two weeks before, for which the
"blocks" were still too strong to explore, the beings did give her
some meaningful information in response to her request to "show
me the end."
We returned to the beam of light and she described passing
through her window, the porch, and a tree. She saw her apartment
bui lding getting smaller and smaller and the city receding below
her. As she went up, she felt that although she was wearing only
underwear the energy from the beam kept her warm. She was
brought backwards up through "a hole in the floor" of a ship and
found herself in a room with a wall that was more rounded than
other rooms she had been in. "They want to talk to me about
something," she felt. There were a lot of other beings "milling
around" and a few other humans being taken to various places on
the ship. The beings took her along a wide corridor that led
around the ship and she could see stars "just hovering there"
through a window.
I asked if she was still half asleep or fully awake by then and
she replied, "It's not really either ... once they put me in the
beam, I kind of shift to this other consciousness that's not either,
really." I asked what this consciousness is like and how it differs
from "our ordinary waking consciousness." She replied, "It's like
I have access to an entirely different part of me that I don't have
access to in normal waking consciousness." In this altered state
Catherine feels she knows "more of them. I know more about
them. It's not like kind of half-knowing maybe something happened like when I'm awake." The knowing, she said, is just as
real as in our ordinary consciousness. "It's the same thing as
knowing something here, but it's just like that, the door was shut
in my mind and I don't have the key to it and they do." In the
hypnotized state she was fully present to this other realm of information.
Catherine thought irritatedly that- this long trip through the curving corridor would have been unnecessary if they had simply
brought her in the other side of the ship, and she got the impres-
sion that the beings were, as ever, irritated with her questioning,
oppositional attitude. They came to another room with a sliding
door that slid open upwards. The room seemed to transform from
a typically spare spaceship room with tables, curved walls, and
perhaps a viewing screen into an ornate executive conference
room complete with shag carpeting, mahogany paneling, and a
large viewing screen. As Catherine described when she reviewed
the tape of this session, she had had the impression that "the more
I thought of a corporate executive conference room, the more it
appeared," but when she realized that this was a kind of staging,
the conference room "images just melted away to reveal the previous images, and finally the actual room."
During the session she said she was aware of the simulation of
a conference room and objected to their concocting this just for
her benefit. But she was told, "We have to have a conference, so
you have to think it's a conference, so we' re taking you to a conference room so you can be in that kind of serious frame of mind
instead of making your usual smart-ass remarks that you always
do." "When this happened," Catherine observed, "I was just starting to not fight them. I was just at the very beginning. I'm not
where I am now. So it was a very different situation. I was relating differently than I do now." The "goofy" tricks, she felt, were
appropriate to her level of consciousness at the time. Once she
was through the staging theatricals, the room was returned to its
original state and Catherine was told to sit on a small, cold metal
chair.
She was then shown scenes of nature on the screen, "like a
camera panning a forest-trees, and there's a deer, and you know,
moss and dirt and needles on the ground, and I'm getting this impression like this is so beautiful, this is so beautiful." But she felt
that her emotions were being manipulated and resisted, making
"them have to work harder." Looking back she thought this was
"okay because it gives me a little bit more control in the situation,
and if they want me to listen to what they have to say they need
to treat me as an equal being and not use all these manipulative
tricks on me."
"Other nature things" appeared on the screen, she said, "like
Grand Canyon, and like okay, great, I've seen this on TV. It's going to the desert. It's going to be pyramids. I'm seeing more
· Egyptian, ancient things, like hieroglyphs and pictures, pictures of
pharaohs and things, and I' m getting this thing, this was your
life ... I'm like, Oh ! That's cool ... It's kind of like a travelogue
of my past lives." At that point she became intrigued, "because I
like the ancient Egyptians a lot, so this is cool, if I was there."
Then the beings showed her a current picture of tomb paintings
with the paint flaking off, "but then it switched to me painting it."
But in that "incarnation" she was a man and as she watched this
scene "this makes sense to me ... This is not a trick. This is like
useful information. This is not them pulling a bunch of shit like
everything else." Catherine now felt that her insistence upon a
more reciprocal exchange of information had been affirmed.
I then asked Catherine to tell me more about this image of herself as a painter in the tomb of an Egyptian pyramid. In response
to my questions she provided a great deal of information that she
seemed to know as the painter, who was called something like
"Akremenon." Some of this Catherine could have known from
reading standard books about Egypt. Other details, such as the
process of making the paint which she seemed to know well, and
appears to be consistent with one textbook account, would not
most likely have been known to her. She described the man's skin
color, his clothing (''just a wraparound loincloth") and headdress,
which denoted the higher status of royal service when compared,
for example, to a slave. What was striking at this juncture was the
fact that the quality of Catherine's experience was entirely transpersonal, i .e., she was not having a fantasy about the painter. Instead she was Akremenon and could "see things from totally his
point of view instead of from me watching it."
Catherine described the light in the. room in which she was
painting (close to the outside, a kind of maze passage to get to the
tomb); what Akremenon was painting (the blue headdress of a
pharaoh's wife who was wearing a white dress and was holding
a little jar as an offering in an act of atonement to the god of the
dead, Anubis, in order to be buried and obtain eternal life with the
pharaoh) ; another artist working on something "down lower"; her
pleasure in doing this work ("I could do much worse for myself.
I could be having to cut out limestone blocks for the outside");
and the rare blue stones "from one of the conquered countries" he
ground to make the paint. She said that Akremenon learned his
craft from an . older painter when he was a boy. After completing
this scene "I' ve got to paint a bunch of dire warnings for grave
robbers."
His wife's name was Tybitserat, and Catherine called the pharaoh, who she said was of the Middle Kingdom and of "average"
importance, Amen Ra [this is confusing, since Amun Ra is the
name of an important Egyptian deity, not a pharaoh], but added,
''To be perfectly honest it didn't matter to me that much as long
as I had a secure position, I didn't really care." Later, reviewing
my manuscript, Catherine wrote that it was difficult to remember
the name of the pharaoh as this "was not central to what they
were trying to show me. It wasn't the meaning or purpose of that
'life' . I could be confusing several 'past lives' even !" She believes
that the pharaoh changed his name and "got rid of a lot of the
gods." (Perhaps she is referring here to Ikhnaton, the New Kingdom pharaoh who abandoned polytheism and embraced monotheism.) Catherine also reported many details regarding the
appropriate size of various figures on the panel she was painting
("regular people are small, royalty is bigger, a..r1d the gods are the
biggest") and the complex problems of proportionality the painters
faced as a result of the demotion of fanner gods by the pharaoh.
After showing her the scene in Egypt she said that one of the
beings asked her, "Do you understand?" What she realized then is
that "everything's connected," canyons, deserts, and forests. "One
cannot exist without the other, and they were showing me in a
fanner life to show that I was connected with that, and I was connected with all these other things and I can't separate out as I've
been trying to do." To Catherine this meant that "I can't continue
the way I've been going, and I can't continue to fight them the
way I have been fighting them because I'm connected to them
too. When I fight them I'm only fighting myself and I'm fighting
my connections to all these things which you can't fight It's
there."
She asked the aliens why they needed to use such "theatrics" to
show her this, and they replied " 'to make you understand, to
comprehend the implications. To put you in the right frame of
mind. ' And I'm kind of like, hey, now we're getting someplace !"
She also seemed to learn from this episode that certain emotions,
like "love, caring, helpfulness, compassion" are "the key,"
whereas others like anger, hatred, and fear are "not useful," especially fear. "Fear is like the worst one. They were trying to get me
to get over fear, and that's why they were trying to scare me so
badly, because I would eventually get sick of it and get over it and
get on to the more important things."
I asked her to explain further how scaring her so badly would
get her beyond fear. After a while the human body cannot handle
it, she explained, "because it's j ust like you're on overload all the
time, and number two, you just get sick of it because you can't really concentrate on anything else ... When you get saturated,"
she added, "then you go beyond it ... You have to make a conscious decision to get beyond it ... It's when you finally say I
can't continue like this then you get over it ... You decide to rid
yourself of that fear . . . I kind of explained to myself why it
didn't help me to be immersed in the fearfulness anymore." I
pressed her to capture more precisely the process of transforming
her experience of fear. "I still get fearful sometimes," she said.
"It's kind of like I had to push myself to the next level. I had to
take the next step, get to the next plateau ... You let it go. I
mean, you feel it, and you let it pass through you, and it's gone
... you don't hold on to it like you did before ... I had gotten
to that point where I had decided to go on to the next level."
What she had learned during this abduction experience was "the
next lesson," which followed naturally from the emotional shifts
that Catherine had achieved "the week before" this abduction experience.
Before we ended the session, Catherine said that her next goal
or "role" was to "show others the way beyond fear ... It's kind
of like, you have mastered this lesson now, so you are fit to go
show others the way." She also said that she had asserted to the
beings once again that the "cheap theatrics to make your point" in
creating the illusion of a "big global conference room" were unnecessary. But they insisted that "It's going to have more of an
impact on you than if we just tell you this is a conference room."
She seemed finally to accept that "they have their reasons and I
shouldn't question them." We also came to the conclusion that her
stubborn self-assertiveness and questioning though "making it a
hell of a lot harder than it needs to be," might have been a productive element in her developing process.
Remaining true to herself to the end, Catherine thought again,
as they led her back along the corridor, "We could just go out
the other side." Then "We go and stand on the same place" and
the floor "kind of disintegrates beneath us, and we go down the
beam, and geez, through things again, which is very disconcerting,
and they put me back ... I get in bed, and I lie down, and I kind
of pull up the covers halfway, and one of them pulls up the covers
the rest of the way." Finally, she made the passing observation
that when the beam of light comes down it is blue, but that it is
white at the end of her abduction experience when she returns on
or in it. As we reviewed the session Catherine, like other
abductees, suggested the things she had experienced "are like not
from our space/time," which, to her was "just another example"
of how "all these things are connected and you have a connection
to them."
At the next abductee support group, which was two weeks after
this session, Catherine shared her ideas- about how to deal with the
terror associated with the abduction experiences, as several members of the group described feeling trapped in their fear reactions.
"I think it depends on how you're interacting with them," she
said. "If they come to you and your first reaction is to act like a
scared lab rat and curl up in a comer of the bed and try to hide,
like a rat in a comer of a cage, and they have to come get you
for whatever reason, they' re going to treat you in that manner. But
if you react like, 'Okay, let's deal. Let's try to have some kind of
meaningful interaction,' I think their reaction is going to be a lot
more respectful and a lot more on a peer level than if you react
in an immediately fearful way." Later she shared the process of
dealing with fear (getting "to this saturation point, so sick of it
that you get beyond it") that she had learned in the last regression.
Then, she said, "you go on to the next level and learn whatever
thing you have to learn at that level. But the fear is the barrier to
getting anywhere else."
DISCUSSION
The unfolding of Catherine's case has followed her sense of need
and desire to know more about her experiences. As a result, a
number of areas remain unexplored at the time of this writing. For
example, Catherine told Pam Kasey in a conversation in October
1992 that she had had a "flashback" that went "through my head
over and over again" of being in a nursery with many bassinets.
In it, a female nurse brings one of the babies over to her and tells
Catherine that she must hold it. She feels repulsed and disgusted
and tells the nurse that she does not want to. "It was very hard not
to start crying during class when this flashback happened," Catherine said. We have not looked into these suggestive images
further.
Nevertheless, Catherine's case illustrates many of the characteristic features of the alien abduction phenomenon. Her candor and
courage, ability to describe details, straightforward articulation of
her experiences, and, above all, her self-critical and hardheaded
quality of mind give her story special value. Initially Catherine
was ready to reject as inconsequential the suggestive experiences
that she could already consciously recall. She sought help reluctantly and initially held as dreams abduction experiences that she
later felt to be real, although they were undergone in another state
of consciousness. As more and more details of her troubling experiences were relived with intense emotions, Catherine clung to
her doubts as to their actuality, looking with me for conventional
explanations, until she acknowledged in a note after her fourth
session that "my foundations of reality have been shaken." Most
instrumental in Catherine's emerging acknowledgment of the personal truth of what she had undergone was her sense of herself as
a person not given to the expression of strong feelings without a
solid basis in actual experience.
The acceptance of the actuality of her experiences, whatever
their source may ultimately prove to be, has permitted Catherine
to deal more effectively with the powerful affects and bodily feelings that accompany them, especially terror, rage, and grief, and
to reach a higher or more creative level of consciousness. Of special value to her personal transformation has been Catherine's dec ision to let her fears fully "saturate" her being when the
encounters occur, rather than to aggressively fight the threatening
energies embodied in the alien presence and activity. This has not
meant a blind surrender to the aliens' purposes, but is, rather, the
recognition of the need to let go of control in the face of mysterious forces that she cannot usefully oppose.
Catherine's shift in attitude from antagonistic battling-a stance
that was initially useful for maintaining some sense of personal
integrity and agency-to a kind of active acceptance has had several results. It has enabled her to undergo considerable personal
growth that has been manifested by a desire, which she is already
implementing, to help other abductees come to terms with their
experiences and by a deepening sense of concern for the fate of
the earth's environment. She says that information regarding the
pollution of nature and the breakdown of the earth's interconnected living systems has been given to her during her abduction
experiences. Although Catherine says she distrusts the aliens' motives in apparently trying to arrest these processes (perhaps they
just want to protect their experimental arena and subjects), she
says she can see the purpose humans share with them in preserving the earth.
Catherine's accepting and open attitude seems to have begun to
bring some response to her desire for a more reciprocal relationship with the aliens, or at least to bring answers to some of her
questions. Instead of being told, as so many abductees are, that
they are "not ready to know," recently Catherine has had less
traumatic experiences and has reported having the interconnectedness of the earth's living systems powerfully revealed to her during her alien encounters. Also meaningfully demonstrated to her,
but more difficult for a Western mind to accept, was the intercon-
nectedness of all consciousness as manifested in the experience
(convincing to her) of a previous "incarnation" as an Egyptian
court painter.
As is true in all abduction narratives, Catherine's case raises
more questions than it answers. For example, what is the technology or process-we hardly know the right words-whereby one's
mind can be so deliberately tricked as to see a forest on a spaceship or an executive conference room instead of the more stark or
"typical" room on the craft? A nd, finally, we are faced in Catherine's story, as in so many abduction cases, with questions about
the real purpose or meaning of the reported hybrid reproductive
project or experiment, which is disturbingly manifested in Catherine's experiences. She describes rows of hybrid babies in some
sort of incubatorium, and tells of a huge room with hundreds of
tables on which human beings are undergoing procedures in
which th_ey have not agreed to participate.

=========================================================
CHAPTER EIGHT. DELIVERANCE FROM THE INSANE ASYLUM

Joe, a thirty-four-year-old psychotherapist with a professional development consulting frrm, wrote to me in August 1992 that he
had had "a variety of ET experiences going back to early childhood" and felt the urgent need, "as scared as I feel," to "air out
these closets." As a designer and leader of adventures in nature,
Joe helps people to overcome their fears, including fear of the
dark. When he contacted me he recognized that he was struggling
with "my own fear around the dark." About three months before
he contacted me, while a massage therapist was working on his
neck, Joe suddenly had an image of lying on a table, surrounded
by small beings with large heads, one of whom was putting a needle in his neck. He screamed in terror and could no longer deny ,
the disturbing power of his experiences. He learned of my interest
in the abduction phenomenon through another abductee and also
from the roommate of a woman who was assisting me in my
work, and wrote a letter summarizing his experiences.
When I first met Joe, he and his wife were expecting their first
child in one month. The exploration of Joe's alien encounter experiences in the context of his wife's pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and his own evolving role as a father, has given us a rich
opportunity to examine the relationship of the abduction phenomenon to Joe's consciousness of the cycles of birth and death over
time, including the report of a dramatic "past life" experience. In
four hypnosis, or relaxation, sessions between October 1992 and
March 1993, one before and three after his son Mark's birth, we
explored the complex dimensions of Joe and Mark's relationships
with the alien beings he reported. Joe has struggled to integrate
the alien-related elements in his own identity. The personal liberation and growth that this integration has permitted has been a remarkable aspect of Joe's case.
Joe, the seventh of eight children, was born and grew up in a
small town in Maine. His father, who sold leather and threads to
shoe factories, died of Alzheimer's disease a year before I met
Joe. Joe calls his Irish family "pretty typical Roman Catholic,"
and said that they were manifestly happy but actually dysfunctional, and that his parents tended to be cold and "emotionally tight
... I wasn't hugged or kissed much" and "spent a lot of time outdoors, where I felt safe and accepted."
"We grew up playing in the outdoors," he told a seminar group
I was teaching at The Cambridge Hospital, "hunting, trapping,
fishing." Joe, like other abductees, has felt that his relationship
with what he calls "the ETs" has provided emotional nourishment,
support, and love ''when nobody else would." He describes his
mother, Julie, as a fearful person who initially did not want to
hear about his ET experiences, becoming frightened and flustered
when he would try to tell her about them. He remembers waking
his parents one night as a child to tell them of a frightening experience and being told "you just had a bad dream." Joe does not
believe that any of his siblings have had abduction encounters.
"I've talked with them since," he says, and received a "mixed reaction from denial to acceptance."
From the time he was eight until perhaps fifteen, Joe liked to
spend summer nights sleeping outside on a porch with his younger brother, who does not necessarily believe in the abduction
phenomenon but told him recently "you were always afraid of
UFOs." As a teenager Joe became aware of how separate and
alone he felt, "basically, you know, social-puberty blues." Recalling that time in one of his regressions, he said, "I just don't
connect with anyone. I don't fit in."
Joe's wife, Maria, is a psychotherapist, five years older than he.
They met at an alternative therapy teaching center and had been
married for five and a half years when I met him. They had been
trying to conceive for two years, but Maria had two miscarriages.
Joe has reported seeing two babies, toward whom he felt very loving, in "a very lucid dream" and wonders if they might not be fetuses of his and Maria's who were taken by the ETs. Joe identified
intensely with his wife's pregnancy and in his August letter to me
wrote, "Not unlike the labor my wife will be facing, I am expe-
riencing 'contractions' that are increasing with intensity and are
painful if I resist." He, in turn, found that often after Mark's birth
the old feeling of not fitting in came back and he felt like "the
fifth wheel." Joe finds Maria, who he does not believe is an
abductee, basically supportive in relation to his experiences and
says that they look to each other for love and support.
From the time he was a teenager, Joe pursued spiritual understanding, and has participated and taught in a number of personal
growth-related activities, including various mind/body healing
workshops, psychosynthesis, different forms of meditation, and
membership in a spiritualist church. When he was twenty he spent
a year livi ng alone in the forest in northern Maine. Joe has
worked therapeutically with people in alcohol recovery, with sexual abuse cases, and incest survivors. For several years he has
been leading what one of his brochures describes as "teambuilding workshops, staff trainings and customized retreats" which
are offered for individuals and organizations. He is also a valued
consultant to other professional development groups, especially
those that lead excursions into nature, including Outward Bound
schools. Yet behind his personal quest and professional competence Joe has always sensed fears of darker forces, outside of his
control, that were associated with his ET experiences. About ten
years before we met, Joe was told by one of his own spiritual
counselors that he would some day be "working with people from
other planets."
Joe has had dreams of contact with alien beings as far back as
he can remember. Sometimes he would wake up with his penis
feeling sore. In his relaxation sessions he described experiences in
which sperm was "extracted mechanically," and "I 've also seen
infants that I felt they were showing me because they were, in
part, my own." Joe believes that the ETs were interacting with
him "even in the womb," and in our last regression ·he recalled
seeing the beings around the hospital bed when he was only two
days old. Like many people with a history of abduction experiences, Joe had many unexplained childhood nosebleeds. When he
was a small boy he had a recurrent nightmare that a witch, like
the one in the Wizard of Oz, would fly up to his bedroom window,
force him to look into her "huge eyes," and make him "climb out
onto the broom" by "hypnotizing me . . . Once I looked at her in
the eyes I was all hers and she would whisk me away." Throughout his childhood Joe was fascinated with but afraid of UFOs. He
would sleep outside, but have difficulty falling asleep because he
was "afraid that as soon as I did somebody'd come and take me
away." Additional childhood and adolescent experiences emerged
in the hypnosis sessions, including an experience from the age
thirteen to fifteen period which will be described shortly in detail.
Joe continued to have fears of UFOs and alien beings through
his adolescence. Once at sixteen or seventeen when he was experimenting with LSD, he became panicky to see a "small ship"
about two hundred yards away "and there's somebody in it looking at me." He thought "it was checking me out" and "went just
a little bit out of the way and dropped into the trees." During this
period he had another experience in which he looked in the mirror
in a bathroom in his home and felt himself '•starting to sink, sink,
sink ... All of a sudden," he said, "I was looking through a window and it wasn't me. It was an alien who was face-to-face looking at me, and he was round-headed and it was very knobby
skin[ned] and kind of just warty, bumpy, and I think it was like
gray or green" with "maybe a small mouth, thin neck, and then,
WHAM! The reality of it hit me, I just freaked because I felt incredibly vulnerable. It wasn't like 'Hi, my name is whatever and
how do you do. ' I felt like here's somebody from another dimension who's going to go, Whoosh, pop, I'm gone. I'm history. They
find Joe's shoes in the bathroom."
The intense pain and fear that Joe felt in association with the
material that came to him during the May 1992 bodywork session
drove him to seek my help. He told the seminar group, "As a
therapist is working on my neck, I had a memory which totally
blew me out of the water. And it was of being on a table, about
this high, not quite so wide, being surrounded by little people with
big heads, and they're putting a needle in my neck. I'm terrified.
I'm screaming, and I almost broke out in hives in that moment."
He was also anxious about the impending birth of his baby and
his own imminent fatherhood.
Our first relaxation session was on October 9, about ten days
before Maria's official due date. Joe spoke of anxiety-filled
dreams of UFOs, alien beings, and procedures on a table in a subterranean room hewn from rock. Maria herself was having dreams
of "the baby coming out and talking" about travels of his own on
a spaceship. Joe told of other complex, dark dreams involving
mythic snakes, fish, dark birds, sexually threatening women,
mythic gods, and winged horses. Vast, wind-swept landscapes
and scenes that seemed both epic and fairy tale-like, captured his
feeling of loss of control, helplessness, and fear as the time of his
baby's birth approached. Images of a needle being put in his neck
during the spring bodywork session returned and Joe saicL "I want
DELIVERANCE FROM THE INSANE ASYlUM 1 71
to release some of this fear" in the session. We reviewed the various abduction experiences of his life, but in the end opted for an
open-ended regression in which his unconscious mind would suggest its own direction and focus.
Joe's first image in the altered state was of a nonhuman being
with a triangular face and a large forehead, narrow chin, and large,
black, elliptical eyes. "It's inviting me back," he said. "It's moving away and drawing me forward. It's got long, thin arms. God !
It's got a long, thin back." Breathing heavily with mounting distress he said, "It can move gently. It can move fast It wants me
to lie on the table. It's looking me deep in the eye, telling me to
relax." Whispering now, Joe said he was "scared" because "I
know they're going to do something ... my whole spine aches.
My groin is on fire."
Sensing that his fear was running ahead of his ability to handle
it, I asked Joe to locate this experience in time and place. He said
it occurred in his home when he was a "young teenager," fourteen
or fifteen perhaps. It began in the late evening when he was feeling separate and "very alone." Feeling restless and needing to go
"outdoors and connect," Joe said he walked behind the barn in the
rear of the house as if "drawn" there by a ''real subtle" force. He
walked through the barn ("sometimes the barn feels a little
spooky at night") and looked up at the stars. ''That's when the
ship came down. It came right down. Bam! There it was. Small."
The ship, he said, was "kind of round, but oblong. It's kind of like
an egg," a "standing-up egg." The craft was "real symmetrical ...
more oblong on the top half' and "about four feet off the
ground," with some sort of "feet" holding it up.
Joe felt frightened as a thin figure whose face is "all lights,"
dressed in a one-piece, tight-fitting, black outfit, approached him.
He felt he had gone with this figure, whom he calls ''Tanoun,"
many times before and his greatest fear in this moment was that
he will not want to come back to the earth at all. Joe felt impelled
to go--there is no choice in that sense-but "I am more aware of
the choice that I can go and not have to come back." He felt a
tightness in the neck as the fear he feels with respect to the torn
allegiances between the alien and Earth realms mounted "in my
heart." Sobbing, Joe said, "I'm not alone with him. I know that.
That's okay. But he's not there every day." Joe said the being
communicated to him that he must return to "work with them [human beings]" and that "I've got to have my foot in both worlds."
With his "very round face ... right next to mine," Joe said that
Tanoun put his hand on __ his shoulder-"he 's very comforting"-
and "we kind of walked, kind of floated" into the bottom of the
ship, which seemed "much bigger inside than outside." Tanoun,
Joe said, took him down a hallway to a large room with a table
that he has often been placed upon. With one hand on his head
and one on his hip, the being reassured Joe, who felt "this guy really loves me, and in a way I don't feel anywhere else, and that's
kind of scary" because it made him feel so "different from everybody." Joe lay on his back on the table with his arms at his sides
and noted he was wearing a "white, metallic" robe. He avoided
looking into the being's eyes to reduce the intensity of the connection for which he also yearned. To "open to them in my stomach"
would make the relationship with the beings "more real, and it
makes me more like them, which is very hard to integrate."
In addition to Tanoun, who was "in charge," Joe described
eight to ten slightly smaller beings surrounding the table. "The
one on my left" held a large needle, about a foot long, with a kind
of hilt, as Joe anticipated intense pain. Tanoun told him to look
"inside his eyes" and relax by losing himself there, but he feared
"I would disappear'' and "not come back" if he let go completely.
"He's inviting me forward, and I'm scared. It's like I'm inside
him-inside his head, inside his eyes." The needle penetrated the
left side of Joe's neck below the ear, "almost like against my
skull." It was very painful, but became less so as "I look more
into his eyes." Once in, the needle was moved around, and the
pain ceased. Joe felt both that "they' re taking a little bit' of something out, and they're putting something in" that will make it
"easier to follow me." He said, ''They' re putting a picture in my
mind" of a "small, silver, pill-shaped thing that they' re leaving
there" which has "four tiny, tiny little wires coming off it." After
the needle was removed Joe was told, "We are close. We are with
you. We' re here to help you. We' re here to guide you, to make it
through your difficult times."
After this Joe described being taken further down the hall to
"another ET' who seemed to him "like a head honcho." He was
sitting in a chair surrounded by light which appeared to come
from him. This being was taller than the others, he said, with a
face that appeared more human. "He's putting his hands on my
head. It's like he's baptizing me. He likes me-he's energizing
me. He's blessing me. He's giving me something to help me hang
in here ... He's giving me strength and knowing, just knowing
that I'm not alone. I'm loved, and I'm connectable" with both
them and on Earth. Sobbing, Joe said that he was told "they will
be closer if I let them. You don't have to be so far away ... It's
just a matter of time when it will be okay."
Experiencing a struggle to be both alien and human, Joe felt
confused as he returned to the earth. He perceived "the part of me
that's waiting for me behind the bam looks like them." This was
"the part of me that didn't want to go." Joe "pulled back from
that part of me because he looks a little like them." Soon he was
"by myself behind the bam" feeling "kind of mixed up." His
body felt tight and uncomfortable as he returned. "I don't know
where I belong," he said.
During this abduction experience Joe received an "incredible"
glimpse by "going in their eyes, by just connecting with them and
leaving any separation," a sense of what it would be like to go
completely into the ET or alien world. "I would just go out of
myself' and go "anywhere"-to "world, space, planets, distance."
"Your body or your consciousness or both?" I asked.
"Without my body, sometimes in my body. I become wind. I
become space. I become matter. I spin, swirl, slow, fall ... " In the
alien form Joe said he could experience different energies, "dancing drops, orchestras and music, crash, bang, hard places, dark
places, vast, vast, vast ... I feel bliss. I feel love. I feel connected.
I feel unsafe. I just am in whatever I want. I dance. It's dance everywhere ... dance with different beings, different lights, different
energies." It is "so different" from "everyday life, being Joe" that
it is ''just so difficult to integrate" when he comes back to Earth.
Joe did not describe exactly how he experienced being returned
to the starting point behind the bam. He recalls walking into the
bam, then to his house and upstairs to sleep. But just before I
brought him completely out of the altered state of consciousness
Joe remembered being told by Tanoun, "your baby is one of us,"
the "us" including Joe himself in his alien identity.
Joe and Maria's baby, Mark, was born on November 10, about
three weeks after the expected due date. About a week after
Mark's birth, Joe wrote in a note to me, "As I write, mother and
child are napping together, home finally after five days in the hospital. Mark Joseph was born by C-section [necessitated by breach
position and infection] last Tuesday, and watching the surgery
brought me full circle with my own experiences aboard UFOs. It
was interesting, enlightening, and reassuring, and it gave me
greater trust and surrender to this whole process."
* * *
A second relaxation session was scheduled for November 30. We
talked first about events connected with the hospitalization and
birth, which had been especially stressful for both parents. Mark
had seemed to talk to his mother in utero, and she had several
dreams in which Mark told her the name that they were to give
him. Joe spoke of an abduction experience that occurred two
nights after he brought Mark and Maria back from the hospital in
which two beings were beside him and sent "a shot, like a burst
of energy" into his head using a blunt instrument and left him
feeling "foggy" and disoriented. Maria was with him, but he does
not recall seeing the baby. This was "the most conscious experience I've had to date."
In the beginning of his second session, Joe talked of his care
not to burden Maria with his ET experiences, despite her receptivity; of his own resistance to accepting their power in his life; and
the feelings of vulnerability that they created. "I'm afraid to face
a part of myself," he said. With strong emotion, verging on tears,
Joe spoke of his distress at the discovery of how "intimately involved" with the alien beings he was, "in cahoots," a kind of
"double agent . . . working with them" and thereby betraying his
Earth partners. "I 'm split," he said, "I lead this secret life: and the
secret life is that I've spent a lot of time with them."
But more than this, what troubled Joe was his sense that he was
a willing partner with the beings in using unwilling humans for a
breeding project. Even "last night" he had had an experience in
which he reported seeing a large alien infant head with huge,
dark, beautiful eyes with whom he felt a special connection. Although he felt that the hybridization project might be worthwhile,
"an evolutionary thing" ("every time you hybridize you get more
vigor"), he was not sure what species would benefit most. Almost
crying in his distress, Joe said he had the sense that he had had
a recent sexual experience on a ship "with a woman who didn't
want to." We decided to try to get more information about this in
the regression in order for him to expand his awareness of his
complex dual role and to increase his power to choose freely.
At the beginning of the session Joe reported seeing a "parade
of images" on a spaceship, a variety of "people" who seemed to
be derived from a chaotic gene pool. Some of the beings were
ugly, even evil looking. It seemed like a kind of interplanetary
"United Nations." The total impact of this was to give Joe a "harmonious" feeling, as if he were being shown "they're all there in
good company." His own form kept changing, "like a chameleon." He felt "more comfortable in a shape like them ... some-
what translucent," with a large head and big elliptical eyes, long
and thin in the torso, light grayish in color, the hands a little
webbed with long arms and fingers-three and a thumb.
"Wow ! I feel like I'm inside me. It feels very elegant, very
graceful. I feel like I'm no longer walking-just kind of moving,
most like swimming. It's opening up to a part of the ship that
feels like a heart valve, or something. It just feels very, very spacious."
"Etherical," "fluid," and a sense of "vastness" were other ways
Joe described what it felt like to be in the alien form. He felt "incredulous," doubting his experience and wondering how he could
hide from himself that "I also exist here, on the ship ... I'm just
so much more comfortable." He felt then an intense struggle between his "humanness" and the humanoid identity, which he had
maintained as separate. Yet he also felt that he was "more fully
integrated in being human" than most alien beings.
Joe called the race of beings to which he belonged in his humanoid identity the "brotherhood" or the "Obasai". people.
Thought processes for these fonns are intuitive and "not linear ...
I feel like my thoughts are available to everyone, and there's nothing to hide. There's no shame. There's a sense of oneness, and we
can have different ideas and opinions, but yet, there's still a blending haonony ... This part of the ship," he said, "is for integration
... it spends a lot of time around Earth." Other projects are not
Earth related and involve "other dimensions, other galaxies," but
"time and space is not an issue." Travel occurs when "you just
think yourself there."
Joe told then of an experience he had had just a few days
earlier as "Orion," his humanoid identity. He felt himself to be
seven and a half to eight feet tall, although he sensed that he
could make his body taller or shorter. A blond woman of about
thirty-five he called "Adriana" was brought to him so that he
could "make love with her" and "give her my seed." Although
Joe felt that "she's been involved a long time," it troubled him, at
least in his ·human self, that a part of her was frightened. Adriana,
Joe said, was walking her dog at night when she was abducted
and was "in a sleepy state" when the beings floated her into the
ship. "Part of her freaked out when she first saw the ship," Joe
said. He felt loving and gentle toward Adriana, stroked her head,
reassured her that "we care for you" and encouraged her to relax.
"I wouldn't copulate with her without on some level her cooperation, her agreement."
Adriana was placed on a slightly tipped platform with her head
higher than her feet. She was kept in a sleepy or dreamy state
("mentally they create, like, this web ... they just drape her in
this soft, gentle energy") as she was undressed by small beings.
"There is that fearful part of her that just totally doesn't want any
of this to be happening," and when this resistance "bubbles up to
the surface" the beings controlled her through a kind of energy
"massaging."
The sexual or reproductive act itself was quite brief. Three or
four of the beings watched as Orion inserted his small "almost
hollow" penis (erect, "but not real hard, not like, you know, unbending ... it j ust works its way in"), perhaps half the thickness
of a human one, into Adriana's vagina The testicles were 'just
some bumps" on his body. "They don't hang out or anything."
Although there was fondness and love on Joe's part, "it's not
horny-passionate ... It's not a rhythmical in and out intercourse.
It feels more like just a rocking embrace ... very soft and very
gentle," quite "natural ... like a kinship." Joe wondered "if I
changed my shape, because when I lay down on her I'm not much
bigger than her, and just kind of rock a little side to side . . . It
doesn't take long. It's more like intent. It's not like I have to work
myself to a place where my body will release it. I can just put it
in and release it." A clear fluid 'just oozes out." Although Joe or
Orion caressed Adriana lovingly, she appeared to be split. Part of
her "is totally present" and "the interaction feels beautiful," but
her "stormy" fearful part felt violated.
Reproductive acts like this, Joe said, are "necessary" so that
"humans aren't lost in their race and their seed and their knowledge," for "human beings are in trouble ... A storm is brewing,"
an "electromagnetic" catastrophe resulting from the "negative"
technology human beings have created. Adriana's fertilized seed,
for example, might be taken "back out of her'' and "then we'll
grow a baby that's got a lot of human in it" and "raise it" as "one
of our own ... If the humans totally die-we have their children."
The purpose of this hybridization program, Joe said, was evolutionary, to perpetuate the human seed and "crossbreed" with other
species on the ships and elsewhere in the cosmos. Joe spoke sadly
of the inevitable further deterioration of the earth. Many humans
will die, he said, but the species will not be eradicated.
Joe felt conflicted about the information he was uncovering. On
the one hand as "a father" with "a business" he feared ridicule
should he make his knowledge public. On the other hand, he felt
a sense of urgency in relation to his fellow humans. But the "defiant, fearful, egocentric" part of him stands in the way of taking
full responsibility for what he knows. His "human side" has
doubts and at times fears that the dark-eyed beings are "sinister"
or "malicious," with "renegades" from other ships that toy with
us "to make us a good breeding cow." Yet in his Orion self he
does not sense anything of this sort.
After emerging from the altered state of consciousness, Joe felt
shocked at what we had uncovered and anticipated that he would
need a great deal of support in order to come to terms with the
complex and disturbing dimensions of his identity. He felt "a little
incredulous" to discover that he was living "a double existence,"
but the emotional power of the session, together with the objective
clarity with which Joe could experience being Orion, convinced
him of the authenticity of what he had just been through. As a
man brought up in an Irish Catholic family in which emotion was
"squashed," Joe was astounded to see how his abduction experiences had become a "conduit," opening him to a wide range of
strong feelings . He was particularly concerned for the distress that
was caused for Adriana and other human beings by acts such as
Orion's. In the end he came back to the affirmation the session
had given to his lifelong feeling that he "should have been born
at a different time or on a different planet."
The session was both validating and confusing for Joe. Over
the next few weeks he struggled with the task of reconciling his
ET and human identities, his stress as a new father, and, perhaps
most important of all, his sense that Mark too was connected with
the alien phenomenon. A third hypnosis session was scheduled for
January 4, 1993, to explore these areas.
At the beginning of the session Joe spoke of his own feelings
of neediness that Mark's presence was stirring and the lack of nurturing he himself had experienced as a child. His relationship with
Maria seemed to be "on hold, emotionally, sexually," as she was
so occupied with Mark. Furthermore, Joe had not "felt them," the
ETs, much recently, missing the "support and love from them,"
which was adding to his feelings of sadness and loneliness . At the
same time as "my reality has been rocked" by the possible affirmation of the ET encounters, "my heart's just blown away by this
beautiful little being ... How do I balance my needs, the baby's
needs, Maria's needs" and the "deeper levels" being stirred by the
ET experiences, Joe asked. Sometimes he feels he is "being shuffled" like "a deck of cards." Joe wanted to explore under hypnosis
"my connection with them," but at the same time he did not want
to "abandon my kid" as he now felt "abandoned by them."
Before the session began, Joe told of a recent dream in which
a lifeless baby was taken out of a plane crash. He picked up the
baby and cleaned it off with muddy water and saw that there was
something odd about its back. Then he gave it to somebody else
to take care of. He associated this with his sense that Mark is
"from there . . . incarnated" as "part ET' and he feared that they
migh.t come and "take him out of my arms . . . I cannot handle
you guys coming and taking him," he said. He felt vulnerable and
unsafe himself and wonied further that he could not "protect"
Mark, and wondered if he should.
Joe's first image under hypnosis was of an ET showing him "a
tray that they put babies in to weigh them." He also saw babies
in high seats who looked human except for big eyes and bony eye
sockets. "The ETs are gentle with the babies," and three grays,
one of whom was "the same one that works with me a lot," were
feeding them a "green, clear liquid" by putting the end of a cylindrical silver and glass tube in their mouths and letting them suck
it in. One of the babies was Mark, who was as fat as he was in
"real life" at the time. Mark wa.S looking up into the ET's eyes
and seemed relaxed. The beings sponged the babies with a green -
liquid, as if to put energy into their bodies. The liquid seemed to
be the same substance they gave the babies to drink. The ETs
seemed to have "a primary relationship" with Mark and the other ,
babies, "and they' re not going to let me interfere with their relationship with him."
Joe had the feeling that he once went through a similar experience, and felt sad for Mark because he knew "there's a painful
part" that lies ahead for him. He described that "we [Joe, the ETs,
and even Maria in part] worked out this relationship with him before he was born to us [Joe and Maria]." Mark himself was once
a gray ET, but his consciousness or soul "went from being an ET
to being born as our baby ... this wasn't any light thing for him."
There are risks for Mark's soul, Joe noted, in "being human, going into this body ... He's making a big commitment." I asked
him to explain. "It's kind of like putting on a wet suit and scuba
gear, and it's putting on a denser existence and you can get ·
trapped in it. It can get stuck on you . . . you begin to believe
what your body tells you and you forget how to energetically disconnect from it ... that you're vaster than it." Just maintaining a
physical existence can be "all-engrossing." Fearfulness and the
preoccupation with the care and survival of his physical body
could make Mark forget that "he's more than his body" and that
"it isn't a life or death matter for him if his body gets hurt or the
body dies, or he isn't socially accepted." If Mark's energy were to
DEliVERANCE FROM THE INSANE ASYLUM 1 79
become totally focused on his body "then the fear will be overwhelming and he' 11 just get stuck."
I took Joe back to what he had described witnessing as the beings worked with Mark. They were inside a ship in the dar�
"probably so that Mark isn't distracted by other things." Joe was
wearing just a T-shirt and Mark was in his diaper. The ETs were
doing a kind of "remodeling" of Mark so that "more of him,"
more of his energy, could manifest. "He connects with them ...
On one level he knows what's going on ... his soul [is] totally
mature as us, but he also has forgotten ... and it will be a process
of bringing that level of awareness back up to speed." Joe saw the
beings holding "crystals against his head," moving his hands, and
"shining a light in his eyes and on his hand ... It was like a light
came out of his eye to look at his hands. They're helping him
make that connection ... They' ve got him on his back and
they' re stretching him, moving his arms and legs." These interventions would enable Mark to be more connected and less fearful
and to experience "more soul, more energy, more heart." Because
our physicality is so "dense," "a lot of awareness" is required to
expand our knowledge beyond the technical level to wisdom. To
liberate latent powers, we have to "levitate our body" and live
without eating.
Joe felt the weight of his responsibility as a kind of "donor,"
giving Mark over to this evolutionary process while at the saine
time making sure "he doesn't forget ... He's counting on me to
help him remember." In his role on Earth, Joe felt like a man he
read about who went "undercover," admitting himself to an insane
asylum to discover the abuses there but became stuck inside after
the people who knew him outside the walls died off. Joe likened
his lonely struggle to sell himself and manipulate his way materially, indeed "human exi stence" itself, to living in an insane asylum. "Let's pretend, pretend everything's great. Let's pretend
we're not all so fuckin' tight, so tense that we can't even walk
straight. Let's pretend. You know, you scratch my back and I'll
scratch yours." How, he wondered, was he to raise Mark in the insane asylum so that his spirit could be preserved.
At this point Joe's attention shifted to his own pain and loneliness and his relationship with the beings. He felt intense isolation
and aloneness, as if he had contracted "into this hard shell" like
an "egg that's just hard and dark." He remembered the ETs hands
on him and felt he was "pupating or something" as blocked energies were released. He said he was seven or eight years old and
in a vast space, as if underground. He experienced himself as ifsplit between his ET and human selves. The ET part has got "his
hands on my kidneys, my lower back," and his human self is "trying to relax and open and to connect to him. Oh, God! It's almost
sexual." Joe was experiencing intense emotions at this point, expressed in sounds like "Ohhhhh" and "Ahhhhhh." These feelings,
a kind of combination of excitement and pleasurable release of
tension, grew stronger as Joe spoke of energy moving through his
body. "The ET part of me is the most grounded and the least
changing, and he's kind of like orchestrating. He has the most information of all of us. He's facilitating. Oh, but he's getting
healed too." Intense energy, he said, moved up his spine and
throughout his body. At first he felt "fragmented," but the "light.
I feel it like light" brought his parts together. Joe seemed to continue to absorb energy in "slow pulses," which gave him deep
satisfaction.
As he experienced his ET and human parts becoming integrated, Joe felt less alone. He said he could also connect with
Mark. "It's like I'm more on his wavelength." I asked him what
was the source of the energy he seemed to be taking in. "It's me,
you know, it's our soul or essence" or "my ET self." It had always been there, but "I just wasn't energized to it. It was locked
[from] me." I asked Joe what happened during the seven- or
eight-year-old period, but he could remember only that it was "a
hard time." As he spoke of letting go of the blocks, he felt new
waves of energy course through his body. More expressive sounds
came forth as he felt "all these shivers. Chills ... rolling, rolling,
rolling through me. I feel like I'm expanding like a blown-up balloon." These pleasure feelings seemed to begin in the kidney region and radiate through his whole body.
After this, Joe's heart opened to Maria, and then he felt himself
walking through and closing a patio glass door with the sight and
sound of beautiful chimes. I asked about the relationship he had
spoken of between his soul and his ET self. The ET self, he said,
"was like another manifestation of my soul." Then he added, "I
feel like I just integrated all parts of me towards oneness." He was
struck with a powerful image of looking down and seeing his own
body as if in "a hall of mirrors" and saw himself "on many different levels ." The experience was intensely "beautiful" as Joe experienced "walking through these different membranes of
myself." The levels were "getting together" in a "harmonious" order. "It felt real integrated." Joe felt that now he could be with
Mark in the human insane asylum. "From a more grounded place"
he could "walk him through the hall of mirrors."
At this point in the session Joe no longer felt himself to be in
a ship. Rather, he was in ''just space" or in "many dimensions"­
there were no right words. A "gray" being seemed to smile at him
and asked. "So how does it feel?" Joe described, "I'm not fragmented. It feels gr�at. It's like oneness." He thought that although
the ETs had participated in his process of integration that "it gets
bigger than them, beyond them." Something more reciprocal
seemed to be occurring, bringing them also closer to "oneness,
closer to creation." The ET-human connection "enables them to
become more than just ET and human ... Working with us feels
like it helps them go even higher." The ET that asked, "So how
does it feel?" seemed genuinely curious on his own behalf.
After the session, Joe and I talked of the implications of the
session for his parenting of Mark. He felt he could more fully "be
here for him," help him "stay strong and help him stay connected" with his "higher self." Joe felt that for himself his abduction experiences, especially as revealed in this session, were "like
a rite of passage," a "step of growth" toward becoming "more human." He felt that as a human being he had been part of "an experiment that went sour," a kind of aberration of God's creation.
We returned to the image of this culture as an insane asylum.
Joe pictured himself rocking Mark to sleep at two o'clock jn the
morning, "feeling the ETs" and "real comfortable with them coming and taking him." For now, he thought, they were helping
Mark become connected with "his own soul." Joe called the
whole alien-human project a "retooling ... creating a different reality" where "there's the option of humanness ." A necessary step
in his transformation, he said, was "my humanness going into the
pain ... I'm more integrated. There's no doubt about that," he
concluded. "I feel like I'll be a much better parent."
This session had powerful reverberations for Joe in the weeks
that followed. He continued to feel the "fragmented parts" of himself coniing together and an increase in "my soul's love and energy." Four days after the session he said he had a kind of energy
crisis or "kriya," evoked during a massage. He sweated and shivered and felt intense pain moving from place to place in his body,
starting in the kidney region and flooding his spine and head. "I
was moaning and rolling around, overwhelmed by the
experiential/emotional/physical pain." His "ET guides" were holding his hands and head, and he was flooded with scenes from his
past, "a full circular tray of sixty to seventy slides containing sixty
to seventy separate experiences . . . It was like the ETs held my
eyes open and manipulated time so that I experienced each tray in
one to two seconds ... I felt they controlled the multidimensional
shifts." Maria came into the room several times, but he did not
want to speak to her out of fear of interrupting the process. He
found himself simultaneously confronting his parents angrily as a
child and feeling understanding, compassion, and acceptance toward them.
Joe spent the next two days recovering from this experience.
''The outfalling of all this is I have felt much more centered
and grounded. It is much easier and cleaner to discern what is best
for me-how I can best love and honor myself, the one that is
wil<L outrageous, impolite, and divine; the one that is emerging
more and more. I feel my ET guides have been playing a big role
in this and they want me 'whole and healed, ' i.e. , up and running,
ready to go, when the shit hits the fan geographically.
''One of the last things I· did Monday morning was to call a
business associate of mine and present him with the idea of him
taking over a lot of work of my business. It just doesn't feel important any more-it's not what I'm truly being prepared to do."
During the weeks that followed Joe continued to have a number
of ET experiences and to recall earlier contacts. He felt he was
struggling to develop a more comfortable relationship with the beings, whom he regarded as his spiritual teachers, peers, and helpers. "When I feel vulnerable they are totally present with me. I
feel their genuine compassion and understanding." He likened
them to "sensitive psychotherapists" that "impel us to grow" but
"don't handle us with kid gloves." They even seemed to "arrange
contact" with him when he was in special emotional pain. Joe also
began meeting with other abductees in our group for more connection and support.
In mid-February I arranged for Joe to speak about his abduction
experiences to a psychiatry seminar group at The Cambridge Hospital. In this public "coming out" he was able to take this uninitiated group of largely skeptical psychiatrists and other mental
health professionals through his story in a disarming and convincing fashion that left the group curious and more open to the expansion of their reality. At the end Joe spoke of the "incredible
amount of terror" that he still facecL in particular around lack of
control, but reiterated his belief that the purpose of the alienhuman relationship is ultimately "a benevolent situation."
Joe requested a-fourth hypnosis session to recover material
about his ET contacts during his own infancy so that he could further experience "myself coming together'' and deepen his under-
standing of Mark and strengthen his role as a parent. We met on
March 1.
Before the session Joe noted that he was nervous, remarking
that "every time I go down into a session I come back up and it's
like the world is different." It has been difficult though "thrilling,"
he said, to see the world "as this cognizant, intellectually understandable place . . . I would not change my seat on the bus for
anything," he said. "But it's also scary."
Joe told a complex recent dream in which Mark turned into a
very thin, white "ET baby right before my eyes !" In the dream he
was given Mark to hold, but surrendered him with guilt to three
women in an underground chamber. He said he wanted to go back
in the session to "when I was an infant in this life, when I was
a newborn and was still connected to the part of me that was an
ET, more so than I am now."
I questioned whether Joe should begin the session with an expectation of where he wanted the regression to take him. Nevertheless, his first image was of being a two-day-old infant alone in
a hospital bed and feeling vulnerable and unsafe. Sobbing and
moaning he voiced "empty" feelings in his abdomen. "Oh, God ! !!
I've never felt so alone ! !! Ohhhh. It feels so foreign. It feels so
cold ... just like isolation. Just, ohhh. Everything is so far away.
Everything. It's like harsh! It's bright. It's loud. I don't feel nurtured at all." A nurse was there, who "helps, but it's like she
doesn't really see me. She changes me; she dries me; she feeds
me," but she did not connect with him. A familiar ET is there. He
has black eyes with "a blue light to them." The nurse seemed not
to notice the alien, but the baby felt trust and "his love for me ...
He [the alien] feels like a midwife ... reassuring me, touching
me, bringing me back, telling me it's okay." The eyes of the alien
changed, "like clouds moving across the sky." Joe saw concern,
sorrow, and compassion move across his face. The nurse left and
Joe saw a female alien beside him. "They feel like parents," he
said, "They' re just really nurturing me. Really, really giving me
love, really helping me feel okay."
The aliens assured Joe that they had been with him in the first
two days, but "it was I who had left. It was I who didn't see
them . . . I got so scared during birth that I shut everything out.
I shut them out. I feel like they' re holding me, and as I was born,
this, it's like a river, being in this current. And this river just
swept me away, I got scared." I had the sense that Joe was talking
about the birth process itself and asked him to talk about being
born. Then he began to writhe, breathe loudly, slowly at first,
coughing and choking, arching his back and hunching his shoulders and grimacing. "I 'm scared," he said. I asked where he was.
''I'm moving."
"Where?"
"In the birth canal. It's tight! I'm just scared ! I don't want to
go !" Emitting more powerful groans, shuddering and choking
sounds, and ga5ps with each intake of breath he said, "I 'm coming
out! Oh, God !" I asked him then to try to give words to his fear.
"It's like I want to do this [leave the womb and be born]," he
said, "and I know it means being alone, and I want to be alone,
almost to get away from my mother. And I'm scared. And, God !
I'm afraid I'm going to be lost. Ahhhh !" Reassuring him that he
was safe now, I asked if he recalled the delivery, for example
whether there was a doctor or a midwife. "It was a doctor," he
said. "I got so scared, I like, shut out! I went internal. I, I pulled
away from everything. God! I went deep inside myself. It's just a
scary place to be. Oh, God ! I can't believe [sobbing now] I came
back! Ohhhhhh !"
I asked if he "came back" to somewhere he had been before.
"Yesss !" he said. I asked about this. "Oh, God! It's such a horrible place !" I asked him to tell me about the horrible place. With
intense feeling and conviction Joe told of being a poet named Paul
Desmonte in a village near London at the time of the industrial
revolution. Desmonte was arrested, tortured, and he died in prison
after blaspheming against the political and religious establishment.
I took Joe through details he reported of his arrest, prison experience, and confrontations with the authorities. In prison, he said he
was starved, kicked, and beaten with sticks and belts, which left
him with broken fingers and ribs. Eventually they "tired of playing with me-till I no longer responded, no longer gave them the
satisfaction of crying out." I asked how he had died. "Some
would say of starvation. I'd say of hopelessness." After six to
eight months in prison he stopped eating the little food they gave
him, "and the experience became "a kind of healing." I asked him
to explain. He said, "I had to face the truth of my own writing.
Yes, I believed what I believed. I believed that man was greater,
but I never went further than that. I always took my stand there
and fought and fought and fought. But when I was alone I had to
explore what that greater was ."
"What did you discover?" I asked.
"My own fears. My own judgments. My own biases, and I began to experience them." Then "these ETs" came back. Joe attributed their return to his struggle to open to a greater sense of
himself, to his letting go "of my bitterness" and of his head-tohead battle with the authorities. He discovered he was not ''just a
mere mortal stuck in this physical prison of a body and a physical
prison of a cell, that I can travel and soar beyond these walls." As
he "softened," he became aware of "them" [the beings] and no
longer felt alone.
At this point Joe became quite .overcome with feelings of awe
and wonder. "Oh, God ! You mean I'm not alone?" he asked, as
if to the universe itself. Seeming to speak as Paul Desmonte he
said that "in every fiber of my being" he had "feared the vastness.
I have feared the nakedness. God, the vastness of it all. I cannot
hide! I cannot hide from myself. I cannot hide from another. It is
my shame. It is my sense of unworthiness that I hide, that I want
to hide from, that I don't want others to see."
I asked Joe to tell what happened from when the· ETs came
back to the moment of Paul's death. He said he was afraid he
would lose them again and become lost himself in "this transition" to death. I encouraged him to be in the moment of transition. "I 'm afraid to feel it. Oh, God !" he said. I assured him we
were there with him and he would be okay. Joe surrendered then
to a state that is hard to describe. It was not unlike the birth process he had gone through earlier. He moaned and coughed, cried
out to God and wanted to be held. He felt as if "I 'm being
squeezed out of my body ... I'm contracting. Ohhh. I'm not totally present. I'm kind of scared and I'm just starting to space out
I don't want to space out." Moaning and coughing more intensely
he crie<L "Ahhhhhhhh! Oh! Ohhhh God. They're pulling me." I
encouraged him to let himself go. Soon he seemed to lighten. He
said a lot of the alien beings were around him, tickling, touching,
and rubbing him. Laughing he said, "It's good to be here." It
seemed "delightful." Joe said he still had some sort of body as if
on Earth, but simpler, lighter, "thinner."
"It's good to be back," he kept repeating. "This is much more
real."
I asked Joe to explain to me, an "Earth stuck" person, what this
other realm was like. 'There is a golden thread that connects all
life together," he said, "and that you, as all life, are connected to
it. And it nourishes you, both as much as you would let it and yet
no matter how much you negate it, enough to at least sustain your
existence. It is a world of choice and this world, your world, is
beginning to make choices that honor that connection, not that
you have been lost from this connection, but you have journeyed
far from it. Never lost, not without reason to explore, to explore
what it is like to live without this connection." I asked if he knew
why we had journeyed so far. "To explore its outer limits," he replied, to see "how far" from our source we could go. "Many are
tired of' that journey and "are now working, flowing, and struggling back to their source."
I asked Joe why he made the "choice" to return, via his particular Earth mother. He said he returned to "the scariest place to go
to face" fears of unworthiness, where he could no longer hide.
The ETs, from whose love and nurturance he had turned away, ·
had promised they would be with him. With the help of his spiritual guides he chose his mother precisely because "it would be
tough" and "dense." Her fear, tightness, tension, hiding, and pretension were a "reflection of my own," he said. I suggested to
Joe--one of the rare times I have ever made an interpretation to
an abductee-that the sense of constriction in Julie's womb, and
the terror of aloneness when he could not bond with anyone in the
hours after his birth, had led to a disconnection from his source -
and had plagued his life.
"We got to know each other, me and the fetus," he said, "and
it got tighter and denser and denser and denser ... _I wanted to be
birthed," he continued, "to get out of this womb, to get distance
from this worrian," but in the fear he just "tightened and tightened
and tightened, and I pulled away from everything, I shut out everything."
As the session was nearing the end, Joe spoke further of the
confusion, isolation, and despair he had felt in "this horrific
world." His deepest fear is of cutting himself off once again and
becoming "lost from the source" and "lost from them." Spreading
his arms and breathing deeply he said, "Would you choose oneness, or would you choose insanity? The choice is definitely oneness." Before coming back from the altered state Joe spoke
further of his feelings of nakedness and vulnerability and the difficulty of integrating his spiritual being while residing in the density of a "physical body." As he "returned" to the room, he felt
a rush of energy and "lightness." He embraced his vulnerability.
"It's beautiful," he said, "It's like what I see in Mark. You know?
He's incredible ! There he is, you know. He's got nothing to
hide. That's how I feel right now." He also felt as if he were
"waking up in an alcoholic daze" and realizing he had been "living with a batterer." But he now felt "strong enough and grounded
enough" that he would "not go back" [i.e., separate himself from
his source].
In the discussion after the session, Joe spoke of the aliens again
DEliVERANCE FROM THE INSANE ASYLUM 1 87
-
as "midwives" helping him stay connected with his divinity. He
had the image of being in a rushing river and the current has become too strong. The aliens are as if on a rock on the shore, "and
I'm holding on to them." They want him to "stay connected
through this" instead of becoming lost in his fear. Until recently
"part of me stayed shut" from them. Now he has become "aware
of them" and "connected with them." He finds his familiar being
"beautiful" and sees "emotions move across his face" like "clouds
moving at high speed." He reflected again on Paul Desmonte's
self-righteousness, and how, when he was beaten and had no resources left, he faced the truth of his antagonism and softened. It
was at this point that the alien beings, familiar to him even then,
he feels, returned and "I could see them." Though he was martyred before his potential could be realized, Paul Desmonte did
succeed in getting "a village talking a little bit."
DISCUSSION
Joe's case contains many of the familiar features of the abduction
phenomenon, but also takes us to the edge of our knowledge and
understanding. One of our fundamental ontological distinctions or
categories-the separation of consciousness from the physical
world-is challenged by his experiences. We wish to know
whether UFOs and their occupants are or are not from, or of, our
physical world. To Joe, his experiences, like those of all
abductees, have the quality of coming from outside, of occurring
in the external world. Yet some of his experiences clearly challenge this notion. For example, the panicky sighting of a UFO and
its occupants while experimenting with LSD as a teenager seems
purely a product of consciousness.
At the same time, Joe's abduction-related experiences seem to him
as real-more real, he said on one occasion-than those that occur purely on the physical plane of reality, and there is no indication that he is psychiatrically disturbed or that these experiences
are the product of some sort of psychopathology. As in virtually
all abduction experience cases, this leaves us with the choice of
searching-vainly, I think-for ways of explaining the phenomena
within our existing worldview, or, instead, of collapsing our rigid
separation of psyche and reality, of inner and outer, and opening
ourselves to expanded ontological possibilities.
The exploration of Joe's case has occurred in the context of his
wife's pregnancy, the birth of his son, Mark, and his emerging
role as a father. Themes of birth, death, and rebirth are constant
in his material. His own feelings of vulnerability were stirred by
the helplessness and needs of his infant son. But, in addition, the
advent of the baby into Joe's life opened his consciousness to information about his lifelong relationship with the ETs, who were
agents of love and nurturing as well as trauma. Joe feels that
Mark, like he himself, has a dual human/alien existence but is
closer to his alien connection or source then Joe. Through Mark,
Joe feels he discovered his own human/alien double identity.
At the core of Mark's ET identity, according to Joe, is the separation of his body and self or soul. During the third regression
Joe reported being a witness to extensive feeding, massaging, and
other procedures ministered by the aliens to Mark, the purpose apparently being to maintain Mark's connection with his divine
source and to prevent him from confusing or limiting his notion
of himself to his body or human ego. It seemed to Joe that the
ETs were agents of Mark's ensoulment, virtually remodeling him
as an integrate human/alien being. Joe feels that his responsibility
as a parent is to keep Mark connected with his higher self. The
danger to Mark in this world, which Joe likened to an insane asylum, would be to succumb to the restriction of consciousness that
derives from competition, intrinsic financial pressures, and especially the pretenses of civility that are the hallmark of the business
world. The alien beings, according to Joe's material, appear to
serve for both Mark and him as what Joe calls "midwives," delivering them from the madhouse of their culture to another state of
consciousness more compatible with the viability of the planet's
life.
The aliens also act as agents of Joe's own integration and
reensoulment. In the second regression he discovered he possessed both a human and alien identity, which many abductees are
discovering about themselves, and that he feels like a kind of double agent, functioning as a bridge between the earth and the
realms from which the beings derive. During this regression Joe
also experienced the ships and the alien realm as the home where
he was most comfortable and he felt the temptation never to return. But his human task has been to integrate the alien/human dimensions or parts of himself and become a being that is connected
beyond his material or earthbound self.
In the third session Joe had the intense experience of feeling his
alien and human parts come together, a profound, ecstatic expansion, a kind of rite of passage, that contained both terrifying and
joyous sequelae which extended and deepened the process in the
weeks that followed. Joe's experiences, especially those related to
Mark's birth, demonstrate dramatically the separation or discontinuity of his being or soul from his body. The lightness of the
soul's experience in the "spirit" or "other" realm--our language
fails us here--contrasts with the density of the physical body as
experienced in the earth domain.
The aliens are experienced by Joe and many other abductees as
much more closely connected with the divine source, or anima
mundi, than are human beings, many of whom are struggling to
overcome their extreme separation. Therefore, the coming together of these dimensions of his self brings about Joe's own
deeper connection with the divinity, a sense of oneness with all
beings-essentially his reensoulment. Curiously, the reported alien
beings seem, conversely, to long for a deeper connection with humans, as if the greater density of human embodiment or physicality contains some sort of appeal to them. For Joe, like many
abductees, the deep connection that occurs through the large dark
eyes of the aliens is a central part of the process of alien-human
connection and evolution.
Joe, like virtually all male abductees, has had traumatic abduction experiences involving forced manipulation of his genitals and
taking of sperm samples as part of a human/alien hybrid "project." But Joe has also experienced himself as a participant in his
alien identity as the agent of this genetic or reproductive experiment, giving us a rare look into the alien side (although mixed
with his human perception) of the reported hybridization process.
He felt some guilt-'perhaps there are human feelings mixed in
here-for copulating with a human woman, during which, he reported, he deposited his "seed" in her. He felt love for this woman
during the act, but it is understandable that a part of her would
feel a violation.
Through his own experience Joe seemed to have access to information about the nature" of alien genitalia and the reported
process whereby the beings deposit a seed or some sort of reproductive substance in a human body. Joe, like many abductees,
says he was given information by the aliens that this hybridization
process was for the purpose of creating a new species that represented a reinvigoration of life, a step in evolution. "Vigor" seems
a strange word in this eontext when one thinks of the listless hybrid children that have been described by so many abductees
aboard the ships. The current direction of human activity on
Earth, Joe is sure, is leading to the extinction of our own and
countless other species. The hybrid process was a way, he has
learned, of preserving the human genetic substance, though in
some other form. What we also cannot know, of course, is in what
reality all of this might actually occur.
Finally, in the fourth session, Joe opened to a profound "past
life" experience. This material came forth as a result of a choice
that I made to pick up on the phrase "I came back" when Joe was
experiencing himself as a two-day-old infant. This required at
least a degree of openness on my part to the possibility of "past
life" experience and a "return" to Earth from another domain.
Otherwise, I could have ignored the phrase and asked him, for example, to speak more of his experience as a two-day-old and subsequent events. The "past life" experience seemed not to be
arbitrary. Rather, it reflected Joe (as Paul Desmonte) expressing
his values and truth, but from an attitude of arrogance, of limited
and polarized consciousness, evoking antagonism, and resulting in
martyrdom. He embraces the same values now, the conviction of
greater human possibilities, but hi s consciousness has evolved to
the degree that he can communicate his truth in a fashion that also
embraces those whom he would wish to persuade. The "past life"
experience seemed to be important not for the possibility of another discrete existence, but rather as reflecting a stage in the evolution of Joe's consciousness over a span of time greater than a
single human biographical existence.
This session was also remarkable for the similarity of the intense reliving of Joe's experience of birth in this life and the death
of Paul Desmonte. In both instances there was intense emotion,
fear, and ultimately release, as a transition occurred from one state
to another. The sense I had was of life as a cycle of birth and
death, of transitions from one state to another, evolving over time,
and, from a larger perspective, hardly distinguishable one from
another. The alien beings-"ETs" as Joe calls them-appear to
have been with, or at least available, to him as protectors and
guides of his spiritual evolution over time, showing up when his
consciousness would open and expand, as before Paul's death, and
lost to him when his psyche would contract, as after his birth from
Julie's womb.
This observation may prove to be important for increasing our
knowledge of the psychological conditions under which human
beings are or are not able to experience the alien presence in their
lives. If, for example, the alien beings are closer to the divine
source or anima mundi than human beings generally seem to be,
then it is possible that their presence among us, however cruel and
traumatic in some instances, may be part of a larger process that
is bringing us back to God, or whatever we choose to call the creative principle after, as Joe phrased it, "a journey that has been
taken very far," a "journey that many are tired of and are now
working, flowing and struggling" to bring themselves "back to
their source."
Joe's own journey has resulted in remarkable changes in his
life. He has been able to turn over many of the daily tasks of his
business to an assistant, which leaves him free to pursue his spiritual .and therapeutic calling. He has been willing to "come ou�"
to go public as an emerging leader in the teaching of consciousness evolution. He has been willing to acknowledge his ET experiences and identity and openly share his knowledge with others.
Joe and I have presented together on several occasions. I am impressed with the matter-of-fact and non-threatening way he can
take an audience through his own doubt and emerging awareness
that he has, indeed, opened to intelligences and experiences that
are profoundly changing him and perhaps millions of other Americans.

=========================================================================
CHAPTER NINE. SARA: SPECIES MERGER AND HUMAN EVOLUTION

Sara was a twenty-eight-year-old graduate student when she wrote
to me requesting a hypnosis session. She was planning to travel
soon and wrote that she wanted to be hypnotized before she left
"in order to release some emotions and information that feel close
to the surface and to lessen some feelings of anxiety and confusion that have been increasing in intensity." Many details of Sara's
file have been omitted in this narrative in order to protect her anonymity.
In the letter she said that a couple of years previously, in the
course of massage treatment for pain at the base of her skull, "I
had "the experience of small beings communicating with me telepathically." She also found that she was spontaneously making
drawings with a pen in each hand ("I never used my left hand before") of what she took to be alien beings, focusing especially on
their eyes. Her drawings also included passageways and "some
sort of subtle body field" like an "entity's subtle body.''
Sara is one of an increasing group of abductees who bring a degree of spiritual interest to the understanding of their experiences.
Her search for meaning, and the struggle to stretch the boundaries
of her own consciousness, enabled her to achieve powerful insights in a short time. In her letter she also wrote that recently she
had begun "receiving information linking other entities to issues
of planetary preservation and ecological transitions, especially polar and geomagnetic reversals." The desire to serve, "to do some1 92
thing constructive for the worlcL" is vitally important for Sara,
although she does not yet know the form that this will take.
Sara grew up outside an industrial city. She calls her Protestant
upbringing "conventional" and describes herself as committed to
experiencing reality as clearly as possible. Sara has never taken
drugs and does not drink alcohol. She links this to her encounter
experiences and she believes that since she has stopped consuming caffeine, chocolate, and almost all sugar, her experiences have
become much more conscious and clear.
Sara's father has died. Although he was intelligent, Sara wonders whether he was dyslexic, and she suspects that that interfered
with his ability to do the paperwork necessary to be more successful professionally. A frustrated man, he was physically and verbally abusive to Sara's mother and verbally abusive to Sara. She
witnessed frequent arguments between her parents, and on occasions, she saw her father physically abuse her mother. Frightened
by her father's temper, Sara would go into another room to avoid
being hit. Sara recalls that her father was kind to her when she
was small, but when she began to excel in school, he became
quite distant. In contrast, Sara's mother is quite successful professionally.
Sara was especially close to her maternal grandfather, who died
when she was in her teens. He was "very benevolent," and "we
used to sit just for hours, sit there, and I would read [to] him ...
He was my source of support, a really good role model." For
about ten years after he died, Sara would often have the feeling
that her grandfather was in the room with her, especially when she
was at her desk working. She recalls a "funny" room in her
grandfather's house. As a child, she would frequently go into this
room, shut the door, and sit there for a long time. In a "not quite
awake" state, Sara would experience a kind of "hazy energy" in
the room, but she recalls nothing else about it.
Sara was an intellectually precocious child, and she was reading
on her own at a very early age. She was especially drawn to mysteries and books about ghosts and poltergeists. The family went to
church almost every Sunday. "I didn't like the idea of original sin.
It didn't make any sense to me ... I liked the Holy Spirit a lot."
She described the Spirit as "like the connective tissue that binds
all of reality together." By age eleven or twelve, Sara was considering theological questions such as a resolution to the dichotomy
of good and evil, and she was dr�wn to reading about other religions.
While Sara was an undergraduate, she participated in studies of
extrasensory perception. Her interest in integrating the discoveries
of physical science with explorations of spirituality and h1;1man
consciousness have continued. On one occasion, she experienced
electrical sensations in her body. On another occasion, "I felt like
I got out of my body and I couldn't get back in, and I was gone
for about two days." She was quite frightened by this experience.
After graduating from college, Sara married Thomas. She became increasingly unfulfilled by the conventionality of their life
together. He would "blow holes in everything I said I felt," Sara
said. She and Thomas remained married for several years due to
a strong love between them. In addition, Sara desired "some sort
of ordered, comfortable" existence.
About a year after she was married, Sara became very ill. Although there is no outward evidence to support this, Sara connects
this illness and later intense pain in her neck and head to the otherworldly presence in her life ("They knocked me down," she
said). While out walking with Thomas one afternoon, her legs
suddenly gave way and she collapsed. She. developed a fever almost immediately. Her condition was quite serious, and she was
forced to go on disability from work. Her recovery was a long
one, and during this period she and Thomas grew further apart
and eventually divorced. The couple had no children, and to her
knowledge, Sara has not been pregnant. Regarding her illness,
Sara claims "It was for my own good," an intervention that seems
to have moved her onto her present spiritual path.
About five months before she wrote to me, Sara met a young
man named Miguel. When Sara and Miguel sat down to a meal
at their second meeting, he i mmediately brought up the subject of
UFOs and told Sara that he had seen a spaceship (this kind of
synchronicity or serendipity is commonplace among abductees).
Sara refers to Miguel as her "extraterrestrial friend." Miguel reported seeing alien beings in his dreams, and Sara felt that he may
even be a "representative" of an alien species. He sometimes
acted so listless that his behavior reminded Sara of the hybrid
children abductees see on the ships. He was in an incubator as an
infant and often showed "a huge neediness" according to Sara. At
the same time, Sara valued the opportunity to discuss her encounter experiences with him.
Sara's abduction history is mixed with memories of various
sorts of paranormal experiences. She has a very early memory­
"six weeks old or less"-of "being picked up and moved and
looked at." She believes that "someone was taking a picture ...
It was like the first moment of self-consciousness," she said. "I
SARA: SPECCIES MERGER AND HUMAN EVOlUTION 1 95
can shut my eyes and I recall it." Experiences related to ghosts
"were a permanent fixture of my whole .childhood," beginning at
least as early as age four, Sara recalled. "I became a premier ghost
story teller." Sometimes she would build her stories around embellishments of portraits and tell "past life stories" based on imaginative re-creations of their lives. She would concentrate on the
eyes in the portraits and become "mesmerized." The portrait
would take on a "living vibrancy" and fill out into a "threedimensional contour."
In addition to the ghost story sessions, Sara used to play what
she called "seance games" with her childhood friends. Once at a
slumber party, she asked her best friend, Annie, who was also the
smallest, to lie down on the floor and said, " 'We're going to try
to levitate you. ' I don't know where I knew about levitation either, and we went all in a circle. I think I was at her head, and
I started saying something, and then it was like, now okay, and
the girl went up, you know." Each of the children who were present had "a sense that something weird had happened," and afterwards no one spoke of the incident. "I remember that night very
vividly," Sara recalled. "Oh, God ! That night the whole room was
very strange ... There, was a lot of electricity in that room. I think
after that it was not even conscious for the kids." I asked her if
they told anyone about it. "I don't think they even thought of lhe
idea of telling." It seemed to Sara as if there were "a suggestion
they don't tell." A couple of years ago, Sara says she asked the
girl she had floated, "Did we lift you?" and the girl said yes and
that everyone present was frightened by the experience.
Later, during the regression, Sara connected this knowledge and
capacity to the floating experiences into, inside, and out of spaceships. "I feel like I'm levitating around the ship," she said, "like
someone's giving me a demonstration on levitation. Like showing
me, 'Oh, you can levitate !' And so they're letting me levitate,
they' re letting me play, basically. They're basically letting me levitate all the way around the ship and up and down."
Although the ghost story telling stopped when Sara was about
nine, she continued to feel a presence in the house at times.
"When I was thirteen I used to feel stuff in the house all the
time," she recalled, "like things coming up the stairs . .. I didn't
really look too hard. I'd duck under the covers pretty quickly. But
I used to say, really loudly, like in my head-l'd never say it out
loud. I'd say, 'I' m not ready yet! Excuse me, b!Jt I'm thirteen and
just wait. ' That happened a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot."
During our first meeting, Sara di scussed the intense pai n in her
head and neck that she had mentioned in her initial letter to me.
Expanding upon her letter, she said that during physical therapy a
couple of years previously, she "start_ed seeing a lot of figures in
my head, and sometimes they would seem to be talking to me."
She would shut her eyes and "see these little guys up here in this
comer of my head, and they were kind of light, really yellow and
light, kind of rounded . . . After I started seeing these guys the
pain disappeared." The figures "looked yellow and round and sort
of benevolent ... The most overarching feeling I get is calmness.
They' re so calm." They had "very light" bodies with big heads.
She recalls no prominent facial features of the beings, not even
the eyes. Nevertheless, she felt (and feels) a lot of love from and
to them. "It feels like home," she said, "like the ideal feeling of,
uhm, like a warm family." After initially connecting with these
beings, which she calls "light beings," Sara began to put her hand
on the spot in the back of her head when the pain became uncomfortably intense and she'd "tune in" to the "light beings." She
calls this "listening," and she found it to be helpful in reducing
the pain.
Sara also mentioned two experiences that occurred about six
months before I saw her. During one of these, "something" appeared to be looking at her from the bedroom door as she lay in
bed, a presence which was confmned by the man she was seeing
at the time. "All I can describe is like an outline. It was skinny.
It was skinny. That's all I can remember." During a separate incident, she experienced something in her bedroom next to the bed.
This presence was also confrrmed by the same man. Although it
was emotionally difficult at the time, she sat up and tried to reach
out with love and compassion to the entity. After that, the presence seemed to dissipate.
About a week before she was to come East to meet with me,
Sara was in an automobile accident, the effects of which repeated
the intense pain in her head and neck that had begun five years
earlier. Because of this car accident, she was forced to delay her
trip several days. Miguel was driving the car and became dizzy.
He started to "space out" with distortion of vision, and they both
felt as if some "magnetic" force were pulling the vehicle. The car
went off the road, over an embankment, and "folded in on itself."
Sara suffered cervical strain and wrenching of tendons and ligaments, and she was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
When Sara would shut her eyes after this accident, in addition
to seeing the "light beings," she could also differentiate a second
type of entity. When "I shut my eyes I see them . . . I see these
guys ... down in a little row, like three or four little dark guys.
Like gibbering." Later she said, "it seems to me like these guys
are in my head." In contrast to the "light beings," she described
the "other ones" as "frenetic." Shortly after the accident, she felt
compelled to do her "listening" every day and to write down the
information she obtained. She felt this would render additional ac-
, cidents unnecessary.
A few days after the accident Sara and Miguel had an experience in which an unexplained green/yellow light penetrated their
room. Miguel is ordinarily fearless, Sara said, but they were both
terrified, and he appeared to have lost consciousness for a time
during the incident. Sara felt as if she were "physically pinned
down" and unable to move. She saw "three things hovering above
me" like "three shrouded heads," and thought to herself "something like, listen, we' re communicating. This is for real. Something
like that, like, get your act together and start writing it down."
Then ''the whole thing kind of dissipated."
Sara also reports having observed unusual craft in the sky. On
one occasion she was with a girlfriend and they both saw "a
strange thing hovering above." Sara looked up, "and for a split
second, I felt like ... I felt like I was there and I was here. I felt
like I'm in that spaceship, looking at myself. I felt like I was two
places at one time, and then I started to think, 'Oh, wow ! That's
another whole possibility, you're coming back to see yourself. ' "
On another occasion she saw what looked like a star. "But it
wasn't time for stars. If was like an afternoon. Really bright. Too
low, but at a distance." After a while "I kind of got fed up with
it. I'm like, if you're not going tp do anything, then I'm going
home. So I got in my car and started to drive away, and then it
came at me, and then it came at me really quickly and flew over
me ... It looked like a flying star. It was just so bright." At the
time she thought to herself, "God, I've got to tell Miguel," but
she did not, and "it was like I forgot about it!"
Sara's wish to be hypnotized grew out of her desire to "know
what's true . . . I don't want to know a story that I make up or
anybody else makes up," she said. "I really want to know ! I really
want to know ! It's the only thing that's important," even though
"it may be really complicated and really overlaid and everything."
She wanted to "get at" what "these little guys are." Finally, Sara
wants to be responsible for her experiences. "To tell you the honest truth," she said, "I don't know if I believe myself ... There's
a part of me that really, really does. But there's a patt of me that
doesn't, and that part feels like it's destroying me."
Sara's first words after being brought into an altered state of
consciousness were, "I see my grandparents' house ... I'm oscillating between that and my white canopy bed which was in my
parents ' house when I was little. I'm remembering a lot about falling dreams that were a series of dreams I had in that bed, where
I'd wake up really suddenly and grab the bedposts to keep myself
from falling any farther. I felt as if I'd been dropped or had fallen
from something very high back into the bed. I had quite a few of
those, and I used to wake up feeling as if I might be close to having died." I asked her to describe the sensation further, and she
got "a real sensation of silver and like some sort of shaft, like an
elevator shaft that I'd fallen through." There were further images
of "white, shiny material" and a "place I' ve just fallen from."
Then she shifted "to being in a field" and was "looking at what
looks like a spaceship from a distance of maybe a hundred feet,
and I'm outside and alone in the field."
The ship was a "white-domed thing" and had "a thing on the
bottom and an entry that's vertical" and "there's light emanating
from it ... I see a lot of things that look a little bit like skeletons,
but a cross between a skeleton and a walking insect. That is,
they' re walking up and down these inclined planes ... There's
light coming from-see one of the doors is folded down, and
there's light coming out of it, illuminating the little creature that's
walking up and down the inclined plane, looking a little bit like
a thick skeleton. He has some sort of a bobble thing on his head,
but I get a sense of filaments-then I just go right back to sliding
down something into bed . . . Vertical. The descents were always
vertical. So fast! So fast! Like almost rudely fast."
Sara recalls that she used to wake up terrified from these abrupt
descents from the ship, "terrified that I could have died ... That
was not very careful . . . It's a good thing I caught the bed or I
would have missed it," she said. Her next associations were to a
long, �shiny, white cylinder and the sense of her head hitting a
"trapdoor." She felt as if she were going back in time to "a place
where I was dead." Then she saw a being in what looked like a
big, silver chair or throne made of metal. Although his head was
"the most bizarre thing I've ever seen," nevertheless, she recognized him. There was an "outer orb around the head. It's translucent, and I'm seeing inside to a skeleton face. Inside the skeleton
is not exactly like a human skeleton ... There's this outer
filamenty kind of orb around him, and the smile is kind of sickly,
like a skeleton smile. But I don't feel, you know, scared. They're
not mean at all, and they' re nice. They're nice ... No one's trying
to scare me. It's not their fault they look like that."
Like many abductees Sara has had a name for this familiar entity. She calls him Mengus. "He's family, really, kind of benevolent," she said. Next she recalled herself first at age ten and then
five, inside the ship ("I'm littler than he is"), "right up in front
of " Mengus, "standing right next to him." She communicated
with him "dreamy, like in my head . . . half telepathically" and
"half verbally" in English. "He just kind of nods his head." She
asked Mengus "what are you guys doing here on Earth?" and he
replied, "Oh, we' re just looking around."
Sara then reported seeing what looked like a control panel on
the ship, like a cockpit on an airplane but even more metallic. "I
kind of float over to this stuff' and she asked Mengus what everything was. He told her "this is our transportation system." She
pulled at various things, "but like nothing's on so I don't do any
damage ... He kind of lets me, you know. He's really benevolent
... like .here's this little girl, and she's just looking around, and
isn't that fme." Although she sensed "a real warmth and benevolence ... it is lnixed with a very steely emotion. Serious. This guy
is dead serious." Mengus said something like, "You' re young
now, but this is like preparation, and this is really important ...
We're leading you into this pretty easily, but this is not a joke, and
this is not just to fly around, and this is serious business, so pay
attention." It was "just like, 'Don't screw up.' " The great amount
of love she felt from Mengus enabled Sara to really listen to him
and appreciate that "there's no margin for error ... I have a weird
sense that he's dead now," she said, and "I kind of feel sad."
I asked Sara what made her feel that Mengus was dead. She replied, "I can just read his vibration, and when I go to find it now
it's just like it's died and been recycled [see Paul's explanation of
what happens when a being dies, chapter 1 0]. I can't access him
anymore and he feels dead." Mengus "was really nice. I would
say, maybe like my first real teacher." She has "the weirdest feeling that one of the little things I drew, the baby ones, was ...
Mengus's new incarnation."
Returning to her experience as a young child, Sara spoke of the
floating/levitating phenomena described earlier and the sense that
these capacities, although "really fun," had come to her from
"past life." They were "not fun in just the conventional sense,"
but part of how we evolve. "I consciously understood that true
fun can be a lot of work and processing." The vibrational energy
of the translucent beings, Sara said, "was much more elevatedthan the conventional vibration you feel here ... They're just so
much more conscious ! They don't keep everything suppressed in
their unconscious. They're just awake. They' re awake and they' re
responsible, and they' re receptive and they' re concise and precise
and their eyes are open ... Their hearts are open too. They're not
afraid, and they're not stingy and selfish about their love, and it's
just really nice. They' re so, so, so, so nice ... I get the sense
there's a translucent thing on the back of their head ... Our heads
aren't translucent, you know are covered with hair and everything.
We cover up all of our little things that we don't want people to
see, and they just, it's like wide open. You can see right into it,
and they're telepathic so they can't keep secrets that way. So as
a result everyone's just a lot more together. They're not in denial
the same way. I like that. God ! I like that a lot I wish I could be
with them again."
Sara felt that to be with these beings, at least in the happy innocent way she had just spoken of, she would have to go backward in time, "before this life ... I think I'll try it," she said.
Next she found herself flying in a white spaceship with a number
of little windows. It was flying over a desert area-"We're just
whizzing around, and I can see down below and it's so beautiful ... I don't know if I've ever been happy like that in this life,
just like unreservedly, all the time, happy. Wow ! We come over
this ridge, and there's this big expanse of desert, and I see these
reds and these yellows and oranges, and it's just like sensorially
just scrumptious. It's just delicious." In this life her body was
skeleton-like, "like Mengus's ... It's creepy, and your bones are
kind of little and brittle and it's kind of creaky. You walk in a very
disjointed sort of way." Again Sara was struck by the joy of the
maneuverability she felt within the space vehicle, how ')ust neat
to zip around" it was.
From this alien/past life perspective Sara spoke of the "stupid"
things that humans do and the temptation to confront them directly. But "it's much more useful to be subtle and make sure they
thought of it themselves." Human beings are "so egocentric they
won't change otherwise. They haven't. They' ve got this ego thing
that they like to hold on to and they get really threatened ... " At
the same time there are "precious" things about human beings.
''They can smell flowers, for instance. And that's like so incredible, and they get to feel the sun on their skin." As an alien being
"I was operating out of less physicality, so you're lighter at one
level ... There are certain advantages. One is you don't get into
these things like depression. But on the other hand it's a little dis-
jointed and a little bit removed . . . The olfactory sense is not
there the same way. You don't get the depth of smell, for instance," she observed. At the same time the aliens have seen "a
bigger picture," and have more insight and patience. Also, "You
have this thing in your head that [enables you] to access any kind
of information telepathically. So you have this kind of informational pliability. I mean, you can get any information you need"
Sara felt that the purpose of her flight over the desert was to
survey the planet for "planetary resources," in order "to see what
is the survivability of an area like that" in case there was to be a
"huge planetary shake::-up." The desert area seemed to be a potentially "stable environment" in case of a major upheaval because it
was high and flat. As she experienced herself flying in an alien incarnation she felt herself "going back and forth" between human
and alien forms, as if trying to make a decision. The human body
identity was aesthetically pleasing for its "flesh and things," while
at the same time she was drawn to the greater perspective of the
alien identity.
Sara returned then to the present and went on to describe a
huge, ominous dark cloud covering the sky that seemed to exert
a magnetic pull upon her, "like throwing dark, black tar over my
head." The cloud seemed to Sara to embody the projected negative consciousness and vibrations of human beings. Its impact was
debilitating and made her feel victimized. The cloud functioned as
a kind of mask or shield to hide some sort of "hokey" craft of the
sort human beings would design if they were to make a spaceship.
This craft was the source of negative vibration and was piloted by
a human being. It appeared utterly "stupid" from Sara's point of
view. "I'm just loathing this whole thing," she said. The aircraft's
"purpose," she said, was "ostensibly war," but not war to kill people. The war was "with people's heads ... war to control people."
She felt "this huge desire to shield myself from this thing."
Next Sara described childhood encounters of "levitating,"
"floating," and "bouncing" around her in the room with the white
canopy bed. "I feel like someone's almost throwing me up and
down." 1\vo "Mengus-like guys" have been doing this. She felt as
if there were a magnetic field between their fingers and her body.
The bouncing about "was fun ... I was laughing," and then the
beings talked to each other, "not to me" and left headfirst through
the window. These were friendly visits, "like coming over for
tea," but the beings became "mad" after college because she was
living such a "conventional, stupid life ... a very shortsighted existence," especially when she took a job in business.Sara associated to another experience later in her life. She was
alone, lying down on the deck to get a suntan, when "I felt something hovering on top of me." She saw a figure that "was like a
cross between a Mengus being and a person." It was "less human
in shape. but lighter and free-floating." Sara received a communication from the being, 'This is very important." The intention, she
was told, was not aggressive, but some sort of test of "genetic
compatibility or something," an "infiltration," "a feasibility test,"
"dimensional merging."
I asked Sara to tell me more of what she meant by "dimensional merging." She then described what I believe to be the central image of our first session. "It is like a plane," she said, "a
sheet of translucent cellophane." There is "like a huge shattering
of glass," and a "razor blade thin" slit opens between this Earth/
physical dimension and the realm from which the beings come. In
this context I asked her more details of the encounter. The being
had "a light contour of a penis, but not like a physical penis" that
entered her body. The experience was not like anything she had
known in human sexual relations. "The being itself felt aggressive, and I did not like that part of•'it. There was not an emotional
component to the whole thing on its part ... It was more like a
scientific explorer territory." I asked if there were orgiastic activity. "It was much, much, much subtler," she replied. "It was not
entirely happening in this dimension," Sara said, "so you can't really evaluate it in the language and physical descriptive terms of
this dimension because it wasn't really happening here. It was half
happening here and half happening somewhere else." After this
experience Sara "felt like I'd sort of been hoodwinked." The being "didn't give me the full story, and it just kind of said, 'Hey,
trust me, it's important. ' "
Then she said, "If a being were to project itself onto a sheet of
cellophane, and [the] cellophane were to shatter through to this reality, and I could stand and watch, I'd do that." I asked if this had
in fact happened ("come through") to her. "Yes," she said, about
two weeks ago. She had gone on a ski trip. There was a large mirror in her hotel room. She arose in the middle of the night, and
the place where the mirror had been appeared as a corridor. She
attempted to walk down this corridor, but she bumped her head
against the glass. Miguel had not gone on the ski trip with Sara,
but "the minute I bumped the corridor Miguel waS in the room,
and I tried to scream out, 'Miguel, ' but I couldn't scream. Nothing
could come out." She was sharing the room with a skiing friend,
who she says independently saw a silhouette in the room. Paradoxically she "just immediately went back to sleep."
The bump hurt a great deal, but the pain was compounded by
the "interpretation of the dimensions" as "the mirror opened up."
It was as if "a being that looked like Miguel" or "a disguise of
Miguel" came through. The being had "penetratingly dark" eyes,
"dark, dark," and looked "insectlike" with "an overshaped head"
and "a little, shrunken body ... that's using the costume to look
bigger ... It hurt me," Sara said, but "the overall purpose wasn't
to hurt me." It was rather "to explain something through demonstration," namely "this whole dimensional interpretation exists."
By "bopping me on the head," they "demonstrate, 'Hey! This is
physically real.' " Otherwise, many humans are often too "dense"
and/or too preoccupied to be reached.
"In a species sense" Sara has felt "compatible" with the
Mengus type of beings, but the being in the hotel room seemed to
be a representative of another species with which Miguel was
connected, perhaps in a past life. In Sara's view these two species
are trying to connect with each other as demonstrated in her association with Miguel. Each species, she said, had its own "vibrational plane," so that for two species to connect they must "create
a new vibrational plane of interaction." This could be exemplified
in a human relationship that, in effect, crosses the species barrier.
This would be accomplishing an infinite number of things with
"one beautifully concise stroke."
I asked Sara to say more about the being she saw in the hotel
room. The head was the most prominent part of the body and was
"shimmery," looking "reptilian," almost "snakelike, serpentlike"
and quite elongated. "Red vein-things" made the head appear like
"a body turned inside out." The creature was not "bad. It's nice
enough." It was "almost like a sea creature, like a mollusk or a
snail without the shell." It seemed vulnerable, in need of "understanding" and "cooperation" from her. For Sara to own that the
creature truly exists "expands my borders of acceptability and tolerance . . . opening my heart to something that isn't the same as
I am. That's good for me. I need to know that. I need to learn that
and actively do that." It was "sweet," she said for the being to
"put on" the Miguel costume in order to bridge the gap of unfamiliarity. When Sara looked into this being's eyes she saw "so
much love" and felt love herself. She also perceived a "kind of
sad" and "battle-weary" look, as if it were saying, " 'Give us a
break!' " ''They' re tired of everyone being scared of them ... I
feel bad for that guy," she concluded.We ended the regression at this point, and Sara's mind began to
doubt her experience and search for ways to "explain it [the session] away ... It could be delusions and imagination," she said.
But then she observed, "It's not imagination, either. I mean it is
real. It's more real than imagination. But it's real in a hologramlike sense ... like it's projected, but I don't know. I got bumped
on the h ... then you're right back to, 'My God! It hurt, didn't
it?' . . . I went through something here, though, that was real,"
Sara concluded, "all this pain that felt like a searing, burning ... "
After returning to ordinary reality the two realities seemed "more
on a par" or "much more equal."
The larger purpose of bringing these species together, Sara said
later, was to bring about "personal evolution" in order to achieve
''universal understanding." The intense pain was used to penetrate
the density of human denial, to reach us when we are "asleep."
Pain is the "extreme of physical tangibility." Each species brings
something to the merger. The Mengus-like beings, for example,
Sara said, are more spiritually advanced than humans, who need
to become "a little more Mengusy." The Mengus-like creatures
seek a greater physicality, "the ability to smell," for example. In
the connection of species each retains some of its original elements.
This process of species connecting involves "tremendous, tremendous, tremendous love." Most ordinary human love, Sara
said, is much more possessive, involving emotions like jealousy.
This interspecies love is ''more unconditional ... I think that's everybody's sole reason for being here. Soul/sole, in both senses of
the word sole." A few weeks later, Sara wrote to thank me for my
help and said that "things seemed to calm down greatly" after the
session.
Approximately six weeks after our session, Sara and I met for
about one hour to integrate further the openings that had followed
her regression and to discuss the possible forms that her life's
calling might take. After some discussion of folkloric studies of
UFOs, abduction experiences and related matters, Sara suggested
that the aliens may be assuming the forms of technology "in order
to be more accessible to us," to appear, for example, in something
that looks "kind of like an airplane to make it a little easier." She,
like many of the other abductees with whom I have been working,
spoke of the cataclysmic physical changes that may be ahead for
the earth and wondered if somehow eco1ogical and environmental
concerns could unite humanity and help us transcend ethnic, cultural, and other boundaries.
Sara mentioned that she would sometimes sob because she
missed "home," but for her this has "nothing to do with my Earth
parents." It exists "in a different dimension." It was, rather, a
deeper sense of connectedness that she missed. We talked further
of what this other "home" is like and means to her. "Home is dimensional, not spatial," she said. But there is communication,
nevertheless, between the dimensions. "You shut your eyes and
there's always communication," she said. "The content is almost
a hundred percent emotional," she added. It was difficult for her
to describe this coherently. "It's all about ... the emotion of love
is the most ... unconditional supportive life. I don't mean that in
human life, but creativeness, ... growth-affirming kind of love. It
bowls you over. When you feel tha� and when you feel that connection to that, the love feeling is so tremendous."
When Sara accesses this and other connected states, she says
she feels "very happy." She says that "it feels like the magnetic
field around me completely changes . . . like space or something
is fluctuating, like, if you could see a thermal crack or something.
It feels like that." She also feels that this state is somehow so familiar that she has always taken it for grante<L and that if she focused her attention in this way more often, many additional things
would become accessible.
Despite the joy she feels when she enters the other dimension,
Sara feels it would not have been "ethically correct" for her to
')ump" the chasm between the two planes totally or too readily.
"In the past" she said it felt as if she "made a commitment, like
an exchange student" spending a year abroad to be here on Earth.
She was, in effect, in "an immersion program," has "taken resources" and has "a responsibility" to see it through.
One way or another, Sara expresses a desire to use "ecology as
a way to help people make a ... transition ... People have to redefine philosophically what they mean by environment. People
think, 'Oh, my environment. ' But, it's like environment is [complete] . . . environment is . . . infinite. And it has an infinite
number of characteristics, and they extend from physical to
emotional-psychic to interplanor and cross-sectional ... You are
your environment ... It's a much broader way than most people
think," she noted. Sara spoke then of how difficult it has been for
the human species to reach a "creativeness-affirming, Iifeaffmning" place of unconditional love, which she related to all the
ways "by which we differentiate ourselves," such as by creating
gender, ethnic, and religious barriers. Ecology could be used to
discover "commonalities" and "transform consciousness ... Ifyou truly, truly, truly do what's good for yourself, you're doing
what's good for the world. The two things are synonymous."
Sara observed that she herself still experiences "emotional
neediness." Using her metaphor of the exchange student here from
another dimension she said, "I might be able to take a vacation
back ho.me, or be in two places at one time," but she says it may
be more useful to reach a state of consciousness in which "it
didn't really matter to me if I went home or not. Then I can go
home because I don't need to go home." She talked further of
how her . spiritual path was her way of reaching a place in herself
where she could "give love" both ''there" (in the other dimension)
and "here" on Earth.
OtSCUSSJON
At one of our meetings, Sara asked me if I thought that the direction of her thinking and experience reflected something
psychopathological-"like I'm making it all up." She was reassured to learn that other abductees had been struggling with the
same philosophical questions.
Sara has been preoccupied since childhood with philosophical
and spiritual questions, and apparently from an early age has exhibited certain paranormal powers, such as the ability at least to
create the impression of levitating another child. These concerns
and abilities seem to have been intimately connected with reported lifelong encounters with alien beings, beginning in early
childhood with a mentor figure she calls Mengus whom she describes as her first teacher. Sara's abduction experiences, fun and
joyous as a child, but always at another level deeply serious, appear directly related to her personal and spiritual growth and her
determination to find a calling that will give sufficient scope for
her desire to serve the planet as fully as she can. Ultimately, however, Sara believes that at its core the abduction phenomenon
emerges from a place beyond the physical plane and cannot be
grasped through technology alone.
It appears as if from childhood Sara's encounters were a kind
of preparation of consciousness for a life's work she strives to accomplish. This work appears connected to using an expanded notion of ecology or "environment" to bring about a paradigm shift
from a consciousness of division and separation to one of openness, creativity, and unconditional love. Sara relates her own evolution in this direction to her encounters and to her role as a kind
of exchange student between the nonphysical universe from which
the aliens or "light beings" emanate and the earth on which she
has committed herself to live.
Sara tried repeatedly in our sessions to put into words the process by which she believes the alien beings can enter our physical
universe and she, in turn, can access theirs. One striking image
was that of a powerlul cellophane membrane that is shattered, creating a slit through which some connection with the other, nonphysical, dimension may become possible. She says that she
herself can access this other universe and that she has longed to
surrender herself over entirely to the other domain, which she,
like so many abductees, considers to be "Home" and the place of
her true parents. But she feels she is constrained from going there
altogether by the continuing earthbound challenges of overcoming
her own egoistic needs, especially the desire to be loved. Sara,
like other abductees, understands that as she transforms her own
consciousness and shares this process, she contributes in a subtle
way at a wider level. As she put it, "If you truly do what's good
for yourself, you're doing what's good for the world."
Sara, like all abductees perhaps, may be participating in some
sort of project of species merger and evolution. The purpose of
this project may be to create new life-forms that are more spiritually evolved and less aggressive, while retaining the acute sensory possibilities that accompany the dense embodiment of human
physical existence. One part of our long hypnosis session involved
Sara's memories of an encounter with an alien being that she experienced as occurring partly in our physical reality and partly in
another, nonphysical, dimension. The most difficult aspect of the
various kinds of interdimensional, interspecies connection that
Sara described is the different vibrational frequencies by which
beings from the other dimensions live and the radical adjustments
that must occur for us to connect. Much of the intense bodily distress that Sara and other abductees experience during their relaxation sessions may relate to the bodily releasing of these
vibrational incongruities that have been held in check, sometimes
throughout the individual's life, by powerlul repressing forces that
may derive both from the human psyche and possibly from controls imposed by the aliens themselves.
Some of the most intense moments in Sara's first session occurred when she recalled having been struck or "bumped" painfully when she misperceived a mirror in her hotel room for an
open corridor, a "mistake" that might have been engineered by the
beings themselves. Immediately following this shocking and painful impact she 'reported being able to recognize in her room a rep-resentative of another, more reptilian appearing, species of alien
beings that she felt was possibly connected with her friend
Miguel, as she has been linked with the Mengus-like species. The
intense physicality of this sort of experience may be employed so
that Sara and other human beings are forced to acknowledge the
reality of entities and domains that our Western acculturation have
taught us in recent centuries cannot, even must not, exist. Yet this
kind of ontological, physical shock may, in my view, be an essential initial step in the process of human consciousness evolution
that seems to lie at the core of the alien abduction " phenomenon.

=================================================================
CHAPTER TEN. PAUL: BRIDGING TWO WORLDS

Paul was twenty-six when he introduced himself to me at a UFO
conference in New Hampshire. A sensitive, handsome young man,
he is one of an increasing group of abductees that I have been encountering who have discovered that they have an apparent "dual
identity" as an alien (they do not use that word) and a human being. From the beginning of our work Paul believed that he had a
mission to "be an example" of love and openness and to enable
humans to overcome the fears that constrict us and prevent us
from using the gifts we possess. The purpose of our work together
has been to enable Paul to discover the depths of his complex
identity and to take full responsibility for his transformative and
healing powers. Paul and I have had two hypnosis, or relaxation,
sessions after our initial interview, and he has attended two support group meetings. When we first met he was living with his
parents and administering his own advertising business. He was
working to earn enough money to rent a separate apartment.
Paul, like many abductees I have seen, came to me after a disturbing series of meetings with a mental health professional who
he continued to see until a few days before I met with him. He
first consulted Ms. T. , a psychologist, to explore "weird" experiences that had led him to question his sanity, including one, five
hours after smoking marijuana, in which he saw "some type of
being" on the stairs at home. He wished also to see if his experiences were related to difficulties growing up. He met with
Ms. T. somewhat irregularly over a year-and-a-half period. The
therapy included four or five relaxation sessions intended to recapture memories of possible sexual abuse by his paternal grandmother, which did not, in fact, emerge. What did come to the ·Surface were additional encounters with unusual beings, going back
io when Paul was age three, that were powerfully real for him and
had a "shattering" impact on his world view and "everything I've
known."
As the sessions progressed, Paul found that he was becoming
increasingly "awakened" to "a connection to like a foreign alien
kind of thing" which Ms. T., perhaps understandably, could not
deal with. One time in a session he asked for a sign of the reality
of the beings, or the energies associated with them, which was
followed by a loud bang near the office door. Ms. T. was frightened but willing to explore the noise. Paul was curious to check
it out and felt an electric "crackle" in the room but found there
was nothing visible behind the door. Ms. T. was wide-eyed with
fear and Paul had to try to calm her down. He had the sense that
something was "going to come" for Ms. T. over the next weekend
and told her so. She volunteered no information at the beginning
of the following session, so Paul asked her if anything had happened. Ms. T. reported that her bed had mysteriously bounced up
and down. She revealed that she had been terrified, and, according
to Paul, tried to ignore what had occurred except to clean the
house "out of evil spirits." Her assumption, Paul said, was that
anything "good or intelligent would greet you in a very comfortable way."
Despite Paul's feeling that Ms. T. was "suppressing" him because of how frightening she found the abduction material, a good
deal of information came out during the hypnosis sessions with
her. He describes, for example, how in an early session he "expected to see my grandmother abusing me or something when all
of a sudden ... I see the ship, and I'm out in the back, the chimney, and there's these little people coming up and I'm like freaking out." (In our first regression we would explore this episode,
which occurred when Paul was age six and a half, in much more
detail.)
In his last session with Ms. T. before he terminated the relationship, Paul recalled an abduction experience that he dated to age
two or three, judging from the fact that he had on a one-piece, red
pajama suit with buttons up the front that his mother confirmed he
was put to bed in at that time. He found himself "on a table," and
"it scared the hell out of me." He remembered then that a being
had come into his room, "got my hand," communicated that Paul
had to "just be strong here," and took him "through the door."
Paul recalled only "flashes of a ship" and does not remember how
he ended up inside. From the table he saw that the surrounding
room seemed to be made of some sort of uniform metal alloy and
that objects in the room did not seem movable. As he would try
to get up, a being would press his head with two fmgers and push
him back down, seemingly effortlessly, and he would be temporaril y calmed. ·
I asked Paul if he could see the being. "Not yet. I did in a minute," he replied. The creature was wearing a full "bodysuit'' with
"what looks like seams ... All of a sudden he turned, · like a flash.
He moved so fast! And I'm looking at his head, and it was like
classic. It was like big eyes, ·and I'm like they were dark, and I'm
like 'okay,' (whispered), and I just lied back down." He thought,
"Okay. Okay. Yeah. He doesn't want me to look at him obviously." Based on many other cases, I asked if perhaps it was he
who did not want to look, which Paul thought was "heavily possible for me too" as he was very frightened. Then he saw two
other beings standing behind him, and thought "what's going on?
Why won't somebody like talk to me here?'' Then Paul looked
down and saw that "he's started doing something to my leg" with
"long, long fingers. He or she-1 don't really know-it looked
like two fingers with a thumb, and he was just like feeling my
calf, real lightly goin' up and down, and then all of a sudden I really felt my leg, my calf, it was like, it was pain, and I was like,
'Ow, my calf really hurts.' " Paul does not recall seeing an instrument but remembers that the leg felt "numb" and as if the being
"injected something into it."
Paul further described the pain in his leg that he had recalled in
the session with Ms. T. , how "after that was done everything
started settling back down, and then he started to get me up" and
the being was "taking me out," when Ms. T. said " 'All right, our
time's up, ' and I thought 'Okay. ' " As the session concluded, Paul
still felt pain in his leg and Ms. T. asked him, " 'Are you okay?'
And I'm like 'Sure I'm okay. ' You know what I mean? I don't
know. Like, I guess so. I can walk. I can drive home, or whatever." There was talk about the possibility of a longer session, but
the lack of feedback and Paul's feeling that Ms. T. had so much
difficulty dealing with the impact of the abduction material on
herself led him to terminate the therapy. Paul made a last attempt
to get help from Ms. T. in a phone call a few days before he and
I met. He expressed his difficulty in dealing with the material that
was coming up ("putting it all together''), but, uncertain herself all
along as to what to make of the abduction stories, she seemed to
have nothing to say except, in effect, "cal l me when you need
me."
Paul's willingness to stay so long in this largely unproductive
therapy relationship was not only related to how few people are
qualified to deal with abduction-related issues. It was also connected with how alone and unaccustomed to receiving help he had
felt throughout his life, and with his lifelong tendency, like children of alcoholics (both his parents did have drinking problems),
to protect the adults around him from their own distresses. His decision to stop seeing Ms. T. was, in effect, also a decision to stop
protecting her from the distress that his case was creating for her.
Before ending our first session Paul spoke of feeling "foreign"
("all my life to my mother I always said I was adopted. I' m not
from here") and the difficulty that "people like me have to adjust
and adapt to what is going on here if we' re going to live and survive here." He related this to the negative, hostile emotional climate he encounters in mainstream society and expressed his
desire to "be an instigator towards the positive" and become "an
example of what someone can do" to free communication. 'The
model's there," he said but "this world has pretty much boxed it
off. I've got to open that up."
Pau l had suspected for many years that his mother's h usband
wa<; not his biological father. According to Paul, his "father" was
steri le and his mother had had a long-standing affair with another
man whom she had hoped to marry, but who stayed with h is wife
when she developed leukemia. After he pressed her several times
his mother finally broke down and confirmed Paul's suspicions;
this wa<; about a year before we met. The discovery that "my father was not my real father" added, of course, to Paul 's feeJing
that he did not "belong here." Paul 's father (his mother's h usband)
has had problems of impulse control . This may be related to the
fact that his mother, according to what Paul 's mother has told
him, would "take their [him and his brother's] clothes off and do
odd things that were abusi ve." Sometimes he would strap Paul for
"anything that pissed him off." He also may have "exposed himself' to certain people and "made advances toward my sister
[three years younger than Paul], but that's as far as it went. Nothing real ly developed from it."
Paul's mother seems, from his accounts, like a fearful person.
He had the sense that she was i ntimidated by his intense curiosity
and intelligence. "She would try to suppress me," he said, and
make him doubt his own mental capacities. Natural ly this uneas-
iness was aggravated by Paul's abduction-related encounters. "I
would adjust," Paul said, "because I don't want to freak anyone
out. You know what I mean, especially your mother ... . I' 11 keep
this under wraps." The day after he saw the being on the stairs at
home (described above), Paul told his mother about the experience. She admitted that at the top of the stairs, she had an "experience like an incredible feeling of fear that stopped her midpoint.
She was coming down the stairs and she just stopped." To Paul
this was "confrrmation from someone else that something was in
the same exact spot," but his mother denied that she had seen
anything. His mother herse,
lf once had a two-hour period of missing time which she acknowledged when Paul asked her, but she
had not given itmuch thought. "And I'm like, Ma ! Two hours in
the middle of the day ! Didn't you question that?" Paul's sister has
described a UFO that she and their mother saw together, but they
are vague about the details.
When we met for Paul's first hypnosis session we began by reviewing his disciplined meditation program and the tensions he
was experiencing during the process. He spoke of his wish to develop his psychic potentialities and of the altered state of consciousness and heightened awareness he would achieve during the
meditations. He expressed the desire to "know more about my
past," especially to find out "who were those people" from the
encounter at age six and a half.
Before talking further about this time, Paul told me of a frightening incident that had occurred late at night or in the early morning a month before. He had been coming out of a dreaming sleep
when he heard a loud bang like there was something "by the trash
can out front." He looked out the window to check and, seeing
nothing, went back to sleep. Going in and out of sleep he felt sure
that there was "something in the room." But when he felt "something on top of me," and found he could not move at all, he became terrified. "I felt it further off, but then it came really close,
and, like, Whoa! That's too close. Too close! Back off! ... As
I' m freaking out, I'm trying to figure out where this thing is, and
I was measuring it, like off the tip of my nose. . . . I could feel it
right there . .. about four or five inches off my nose." He wanted
to open his eyes but simply could not do it. He "dozed off again"
(a common paradox in abduction-related terror) and then upon
awakening was able to "break out of it" and look, but there was
"nothin' there." Although fully conscious now, Paul found he
was "gagging on my own breath because I couldn't speak" and
was still unable to move for a few more moments. Although he
saw no beings during this inciden� Paul nevertheless felt invaded
by .. something [that] had definitely done something."
Although we were tempted to explore this incident further, we
returned to the episode from age six and a a half that occurred in
the fall of 1972. As I characteristically do, I reviewed with Paul
in great detail beforehand the context in which the encounter occurred so that I would already be oriented as the incident was explored during hypnosis and not have to impede his associations
v.ith too many distracting factual questions. l\1uch of this information had emerged in Paul's meetings v.ith �1s. T. \Ve went over
the layout of the house, the location of his room, and how his
mother tucked him in bed that night. Paul does not remember falling asleep, but does recall looking at the bureau, getting up, and
walking over to the sliding glass doors that separated his room
from the back porch . He said that a familiar voice in his head told
him to go outside, as if ' "I was supposed to meet someone out
there."
As he described his behavior that night Paul spoke as if he
were the adult Paul observing the actions of the little boy from
�right behind his eyes ... I don't feel like he feels," Paul said,
"but I understand what he feels." The boy went out on the porch,
looked up, and saw '"a flash" of "a ship" that seemed to pass right
over his house. "It was like the whole thing was li4" Paul said.
It was roun<L "'like a perfect circle ... big ... awesome," larger
in the horizontal plane than the vertical, "long and smooth" on the
bonom. ••He [the boy] was deciding where we [the "we" refers to
the boy-Paul and the adult-observing-Paul as if they were together] were going. So we went down the stairs [of the porch],
and we v,rent over to th·e chimney [a structure standing in the
backyard] and then \ve sat dovm.�' The boy walked inside the
chimney as if "'we' re han gin' out waiting for someone to come.
[Paul is now speaking from inside himself as the little boy]
really had no idea who was going  be coming, and I was terrified when I staned to realize that someone was there.!' Paul
[adult] notes that "it had to have been brighter because inside the
chimney I was able to see bricks. like charcoal bricks ... I have
to go with him [Paul as child] because I'm-we're-linked in a
way, so we go out and that's when there were tv.·o groups coming
up both sides of the house." The beings were small, about the six1bere
year-old's height with one that appeared to be somewhat ta1ler.
were about four or five of the beings in each group. They
"weren't human," Paul said but nevertheless when "they started
coming around' the boy felt more comfonable and "was thril1ed"
to be with them. They were touching and hugging the boy, who
felt "a great calmness" and "really like home," as did the adult
Paul iD the session at that moment.
Pam Kasey's notes describe Paul's body movements during the
regression. They provide a sense of the intensity of his experience. "Paul is having a lot of body reactions to this information,
an involuntary tensing in resistance to each new piece, then often
a nervous laugh, a deep breath, a sort of convulsion, and then a
relaxing to the next piece. His face is grimacing, frowning, eyebrows furrowing, teeth clenching-then a laugh, head shaking
emphatically, nervous, earnest, charged, overloaded. Further along
it's getting harder-body twitching, tensing, head shaking, nodding, raising off the pillow, face contorting, expression changing
every second or two-arms at his sides but hands gripping, opening, gesticulating."
At the start of the regression I took Paul back to that night and
encouraged him to be the six-and-a-half-year-old boy rather than
the adult observing him. "I get stopped," he said. "I guess it's fear
... it gets more and more intense as I try to be him." As I encouraged Paul to be with the fear, Paul soon felt numbness in his face,
spreading through his abdomen, chest, and hands. With his fear
increasing he saw "a big eye in front of me ... hands on me" and
a sense that he was "shrinking ... There are others there," he
said, and "they won't let me feel anything." Then, feeling himself
to be lying on his back naked in a room with a domed ceiling, he
saw "tools and a bench." His whole body numb now Paul said, "I
was able to look out a window ... It's space ... I just saw stars.
I saw a lot of stars ... It feels like it's moving."
Once again Paul had difficulty connecting his adult observing
self with the little boy and his experience-"everything keeps me
from connecting together"-but was able to say, "I can be me."
Then he felt "plates, like grids, pushing down on my stomach."
At my request he described one of the humanoid beings. He had
no hair on his head and his eyes were large and black with no apparent irises. The nose was "flat, like an ape," and the mouth
seemed to have "scales around it, like plates on his lips." The being let him up then and led Paul through a door. "I walk outside.
We're looking at controls on the ship. It's a ship. It's a ship ! It's
a ship !"
The being seemed to Paul to be "a friend," showed him the
controls, and told him "You' re like me, on the ship." At first Paul
did not understand, but the being explained further that "you' re
from here." Then, as the humanoid figures watched, the being led
Paul to "a colander-like structure a little below, off to the side" of
the center of the big ship. He said to Paul, "This is where we congregate." The figure that was escorting Paul showed him a bed
that was rather like a human bed with sheets, but "it's floating."
He told Paul, "They're your quarters. You're here. You're here
when we go on these trips." In fact, the "quarters" felt familiar to
Paul, for he estimated he had been there "seventy times." Paul felt
confusion and disbelief then arid now, but "says, "I feel like I'm
there. I feel like this is the room that he's showing me that I'm in
when I go to where he takes me."
At this point I asked Paul about the timing and frequency of
these many visits. Paul replied, "He's saying they're all connected, that it's the same."
"What's the same?" I asked.
'The lives. They're all the same ... It's close. It's close to my
life. It's close to now ... I was on the ship before I came here
[i.e., to Earth]." At this point Paul was experiencing what might
be described as if breaking through an information barrier, and he
felt acutely the tightening and releasing of his body described in
Pam Kasey's notes. "It keeps breaking and it's pretty confusing,"
Paul said. "It's plain to him [the being] and to me, but I can't
grasp it here [i.e., in the context of the Western, rationalistic perspective that my questioning may have represented for him]."
At this point the being conveyed to Paul that he would "tell me
anything I want to know." Our session became then an exploration of Paul's dual identity, human nature from an alien perspective, and alien-human relations over time. Paul himself was "kind
of like a spy," put on Earth for a purpose. "He [the alien] says
that your spirit is from here [i.e. , the ship, not Earth]. He says
what makes you up is here, and he says that the seeds of human
beings is how we integrated you into this, but you are from here.
"Home," Paul said, is "on that planet. They are very peaceful,
very peaceful. They're not like here. They've been killed here before." I asked Paul where that planet was. "All right. All right. All
right. You're not supposed to know. I'm not supposed to know. I
can know. All right. All right. All right. I can see it. It's red, and
it's-but it's blue. It's different. It swirls, like Jupiter swirls." The
planet is "in this universe," but "farther away than you' ve ever
known."
I asked how the beings get from one place to another. "It's like
hopping," he said. "Energy, like folds into itself, and you're just
somewhere else ... everything folds, inverts into, and folds inside
itself ... Like you can move one at a time, or you can move like
vast numbers of people ... No one's supposed to know. People
aren't supposed to know this yet." I asked him to say why. Speaking now as an alien, he replied, "We' ve been hurt here before ...
Your people hurt us." Paul said, "It's in your nature to be violent,"
and spoke of the human need "to control everything," and to isolate ourselves from other beings, including the aliens themselves.
"Humans are just another form. You're another lifeform of energy.
You think you're independent of life, and you can't be that way.
You're causing death. You're causing a lot of death and it's your
own. And we're trying to help you, but we came and we were
killed by many of you."
People like himself, Paul continued, were "here to integrate,
and it's slow ... because if we came and tried to disrupt you people it wouldn't work. It didn't work before."
"Before when?" I asked.
Pushing ahead, as if ignoring my question, Paul continued,
"You people are too violent already, you're too violent and you're
too hostile. It's too imbedded in your nature and you have to
come to grips on that. You have to understand that, and it's got to
be a little bit of time ... We can't come straight on. We can't
come straight on. We have to integrate like with this."
I tried to take Paul back to what happened in his quarters on the
·ship, but he deflected this effort and persisted with his struggle to
understand "the information that's been locked in me ... It's
more than we can understand." I felt I had no choice but to let
him continue. He told further of the trouble the aliens have had in
their encounters with human beings. ''There's a lot of us [i.e., dual
identity beings] here," he said "When we come straight on it
ends up in power. Everyone here is so wrapped up in power." He
spoke of how difficult it is "for your species" to "truly open up
to another." As a human being, but identified also as an alien, he
has had a great deal of "trouble here." He is trying to help human
beings but has felt attacked. "Any new thing coming in is attacked ... I'm trying to do what I need to do to help you, but I'm
under attack ... Human beings think that they're it, that that's it.
But there's so much else here ... There's so much life, yet human
beings want death. They' re choosing destruction, and they keep
choosing it over life, over connection, over creation. This is hell
here ... Everyone has tried to explain that to you. They' ve tried
to tell you that this place needs to turn around. Human beings
keep tripping over themselves."
Paul spoke further in prophetic tones of human stubbornness,
unwillingness to accept what we have· done or to receive help.
"That's why people like us, coming here, get caught up in this
and then we get sick like you." The alien beings can be "physical
on your plane" but also be "connected with others not on your
plane." That enables the aliens to "accept others" and to "communicate and integrate with them ... Human beings," he said, "can't
even integrate with something of your same plane, let alone something of a different plane. You can't even accept the life around
you." Segregation, isolation, and fear characterize the human attitude toward life, Paul said.
Paul spoke of how . difficult it is for him to exist in both human
and alien identities. "It's harder for us to be fragmented like this,"
he said. In his human self he feels the great "pressures of your human society ... It's just too much. It's so stressful. It's just so
stressful." He spoke then of how we have expanded a kind of protective "shell" into "a whole separate thing ... This shell is just
supposed to be a minor thing. It's a minor thing and you people
hold on to it. Like you' ve created this new thing. It's a whole new
thing. It's like a little layer. It's one little layer, and you've got that
being your whole universe . . . It's like one layer of appearance."
As he tried to answer my questions , Paul found himself
"bouncing" or ')umping" back and forth between his alien and
human identity or perspective, which he found difficult. The flow
of his thoughts seemed to have a direction of their own, almost independent of my questions. "What is the purpose of controlling
something you don't even understand in the first place? What are
you controlling? ... I don't understand ... You're controlling
nothing," he continued. "If you look at frequency and energy, and
the way it's structured itself around the form, and you start going
deeper, and you start to understand evolution, the way that connects itself to molecular structure-it goes on for eons and eons !
It's further than you can fathom, and it's tried to tell you that too,
and you don't understand it."
"What's 'it' ?" I asked. -
"Consciousness," he replied, "Higher forms of consciousness ...
You're not going to understand infinity, but it's there!" The alien
beings, Paul said, have access to this higher consciousness which
''flows through you" and is an intelligence which exists or moves
everywhere.
"Person to person, nation to nation, world to world?" I asked.
"Universe to universe," he said. "There's consciousness <>n every single level. It's infinite," he said.
I explored further with Paul what information he had received
in his abduction experiences about this higher consciousness. "It
starts as an energy you can 't perceive," he said, but then it
evolves and starts "becoming intelligent." It can "bow into different dimensions ... engulfing shapes just like a cell engulfs another cell and takes a new shape. The energy mirrors another
shape, it engulfs a new shape and networks with that. It communicates with it and understands it. It learns, and it grows. It creates. That is creation in action, and it becomes more and more
intelligent. It grows. It has more to choose, more choices." Paul
spoke further of how matter and energy "flex back" or change one ,
into the other in various ways. Relating this creative process to his
perceptions of human recalcitrance Paul said, "You don't want to
change and grow. Change to you is fear. Change means destruction. You' ve got so many backwards viewpoints on the way it really works ! You hold on. You change for a second, and then you
hold on, forever. You hold on forever."
Curiously, Paul revealed that the alien intelligence does not really understand why human beings are so destructive and resistant
to change, and I asked if the intrusive physical procedures they
perform on our bodies are to learn about this. ''That's a part/' he
said, and acknowledged that the "poking" and looking are for the
purpose of understanding, helping, and "adjusting," but added
without explaining, "There's mistakes that have been made." In
the last analysis "we [Paul as alien] don't understand why you are
so stuck" and have not learned. "It poses some complex problems
for us," he said. "An organism that gets to be at such a degree of
destruction should flip back and learn upon itself. It should understand ... like you stretched it out to its maximum, and you should
understand that you're going to break ... we don't understand
why you choose destruction."
Intervention and change are possible even without understanding, Paul said. "We can turn it around," but "you're going to have
to accept more changes that go on. The changes are going to get
faster, and it's going to be harder for you to change ... The intelligences are present now ... it keeps opening levels." We have
changed some already, he allowed, but our "human nature" would
resist further change. He said it was hard for him to be "like a
spy" that has been shown "different levels ... There's a lot of
stuff around you that keeps knocking at its door and then it stops.
It's happened before. It's happened so many times." In spite of the
great distance human beings have come, they still isolate themselves. ''That knowledge of evolution, that learning process, has
grown all along with you. You have memories from the begin-nings. The beginnings, if you can even fathom tha_t. And I can't
fathom that, because I'm part human and- it's hard for me."
At this point in the session Paul seemed to be feeling a great
sadness as we contemplated together how "out of balance" and
"lost" we humans were. In a nostalgic tone Paul spoke of how
"very comfortable" he felt "here on the ship . . . I want to go
home," he said, and "It's on the ship. It's home. My home is
there." (Quite a number of abductees say this.) I reminded him of
his disbelief when first shown his "quarters." He said, "It's not
hard for the real me to accept. I know that. It's hard for the shellPaul to accept." The planet he had spoken of earlier was the home
from which he originally came, and the "quarters" are "where I
am when we're traveling, when we're exploring." Paul realizes
now that he has been shown "a greater time distance" than he had
previously understood, including past lives.
Struggling with his disbelief over what he was experiencing,
expressed through nervous laughter, tense body movements, and
interspersed comments like "this is bigger than I thought" and
"it's so weird," Paul told how "we came across this planet" thousands of years ago. "We've made connections here before" with
"primitive life-forms ... I'm being shown dinosaurs, in a way ...
This is old. Reptiles-oh my God! That form we were able to
make contact with."
''The reptilian form?" I asked.
"Yup. That form was--that was smarter than humans," he said,
laughing. I asked how this had been communicated to him on the
ship. "I don't know," he replied. "It's like a memory in a way. It's
hard. This is hard because I know now that I can make contact
again."
"With wh�m?" I asked.
"Contact with my brothers on that planet. In space. In that
ship." I suggested we use his language and call the aliens "brothers," since to Paul the beings we call aliens he felt were, indeed,
"my people" or "my brothers."
At this point images were coming to Paul faster than he could
deal with them and I encouraged him to recenter himself and take
his time. He said that ''This reptilian form was very intelligent, a
form of energy that spanned up to that point, and it did very
well." I asked what happened to them. "It just evolved past this
time. It allowed for new forms of life," he replied. "Oh, man!
They can tell time. They can feel time. They understand what's
coming in the future. They [the creatures in reptilian form] under-
stand. They're compassionate ... They were able to have an understanding, a compassion towards the future of your existence."
Paul then felt waves of energy passing through his body, pushing on his abdomen, and causing his hands to feel like "needles."
He said this felt "comfortable" and "integrated in a way." The
material that was emerging, he noted, was, "not foreign" and
''very clear." We were coming close to the end of the session, and
I asked Paul how the material he had recovered today could be
useful to us as human beings. His first response was that what he
had recalled today was helping him to "understand more of who
I really am . . . I am a cross between-this is hard to understand
for me-between what I've known as me and the brothers who
were with me, what the human beings would call an alien." He
could not quite grasp the word, but it came to him that these were
something like the "TA" people. The TA people have evolved
over a long time but differently from humans, Paul said. They did
not expect so many problems when they "integrated with you." I
asked him why they had decided to integrate with us. "That's the
way creation works," he said, but "humans aren't ready to do this,
and we are ready . . . we want to learn."
I asked Paul why the evolving alien-human relationship was
surfacing so much at the present time. He said that human evolution had reached the point where we were better able to accept the
connection. "The human perspective or evolution has grown to a
point that it's intelligent enough to accept more, but it's on the
border. It's teetering back and forth." As we talked of these matters Paul felt intense heat energy passing through his body and
concentrating in his hands. I wondered what it would take to push
us "over" the border. "Accept everything," he said. There is "so
much" to accept. For his own growth this meant more fully accepting his TA identity, "what I am." He spoke of how hard it is
to be "in the middle."
"I'm in between. I'm more than a TA person. I'm more than a
human being," he said. "This is hard! More people are finding out
just how in between they are themselves."
It seemed as if with each expression of opening to the elements
of his complex identity and the responsibility this seemed to impose, Paul would feel additional strain in his body. "It can only
take so much. I am getting tired," he said. He felt flooded with intense sensations of heat and pins-and-needles-like tingling
"through my organs," especially in the stomach, chest, face, and
hands, which he related to big "growth jumps." My squeezing his
hands intensely with my hands helped to release the heat energy
blocked in his hands.
As Paul came out of the regression he said that he felt "a lot
better," strongly "centered" We talked about the responsibility of
his double identity and the energy associated with the information
he was processing. Perhaps the shell we have constructed, even
the destructive course, was not so formidable, he suggested. Pride,
fear, "this ego stuff," were "dead ends" that start out with sensitivity and become "like a cancer" which "lock[s] everything"
down. The alien-human "unification" might create a new balance,
an evolutionary step, a kind of cosmic mutation in, in Paul 's words, "the balance of creation and destruction."
As we reviewed the session, Paul spoke with wonder at the storage in his consciousness of "ancient memories," for example of reptilian intelligence, and the virtually unlimited perspective
this could provide. But human beings have lost the "incredibly intelligent" power or utility of that memory b� as he called it.
For example, "People just look at them, like, oh, the dinosaur hac;
a small, little brain with flabby arms. It ate, slept, shaked That's
what it did. And they were killed by a meteor because it didn't
have the know-how. And of course they're going to relate it to it
didn't have hands like us and stuff, like, so it couldn't create a
home like we have. It's, like, wow. That's so egotistical. You want
it to be like you so it's intelligent You know nothing about their
culture ... you got some bones, you know. You don't know. You
don �t know anything about them ... It occurs to me that this has
been the way for a long time, but we know nothing "about the animal kingdom. Nothing. Yet it's always aroun� and there's definitely communication ... Wh at about the intelligence of the
energy making the form?"
I was out of the room for a few minutes, and the session concluded with Paul speaking with Pam of human domestication of
animals into pets as an expression of our need "to control everything around us because of fear," the narrow perspective of human
identity, and the "twisted," competitive, and intolerant culture we
have evolved.
Our second hypnosis session took place six weeks later. Before
the regression began Paul spoke of his desire to further overcome
the inner impediments to his personal transformation and the fulfillment of his mission. More specifically he felt that throughout
his life he has been immersed in dysfunctional systems, beginning
within a family that often responded to his need for love and support with abuse and "manipulation to conform," and continuing in
dream
social and political systems that restricted his capacity to love. His
has been to break down the barriers of fear between people
and to create "a network of lines of communication" on the way
to building new structures based on love and healing. But he fears
the pressures that are directed against anyone who tries to push
against familiar limits, "an incredible attack from the society in
general upon you because you are pushing another boundary
open." He expressed concern for what would happen to me.
"Everyone's going to be scared shitless of what you're doing, and
let alone the fact that it feels like it might be successful."
Paul spoke of his need to feel· confident of the emotional climate in the house before "being opened" further, and commented
on the uneasiness about the work with abduction experiences he
had sensed in my wife, which was allayed somewhat in a brief
conversation that he had had with her before the session began. It
became evident that questions of trust between Paul and me had
developed, and, to a degree, I was being perceived through the
lens of his disappointment with previous caregivers and also as an
authoritative senior representative of the hierarchical social systems about which he felt so troubled. As we sorted out these concerns, trying together to separate reality-based concerns from
distortions that Paul brought to the situation, he became better
able to "trust you enough" for the session to proceed. I acknowledged that it was natural for him to need to test my trustworthiness, and he said that the "testing process" did not have to be
"hostile" or "a violent proving. Then truth would be lost for
sure ... I know you're coming from a deep place," he said, "and
I do feel safe in telling you what's going, what's happening."
Before we started the regression Paul spoke further about the
intense struggle he had been undergoing as he confronted his own
and other people's fears related to the abduction phenomenon.
Pam had introduced him to several other abductees with similar
difficulties, but, although this was helpful, his experience that "everybody keeps throwing things out'' left him feeling as if he were
"drowning." I spoke to Paul of the "hero's journey" of which he
was embarked, and he talked further of "this outrageous doubt
and fear that's here." In the regression he wanted to "go in" to the
"incredible pain" he felt "right in my heart, right in my chest."
Referring to his drive to my house that afternoon, Paul said, "I
was crying my eyes out all the way here. I was just feeling everything. Just the pain of the world ... When I pulled up in front
tears were just streaming down my face ... I have trouble crying
in front of anyone." I asked if he had been able to cry with hisfather. "Probably," he said, but it would have been a cry of defeat.
"I 'm crying out of pain, out of power, coming here," he said. My
last question concerned what he wanted to go back toward. He
wanted to "access" that pain "for sure," he said. "It's going to
blow out of my chest, and I'm in my own way right now. More
than I have ever felt before."
Paul's first image in the hypnosis was from a recent abduction
experience. A hooded figure on a ship took his hand and walked
him through a door and down a hall to a dark room. In the room
a light was on and he was strapped into a chair. The figure had
a big pointer and showed Paul on a screen getting hit by someone
in his family. Then "he's showing me the world" and "all these
people are dying. He's telling me that I'm going to fix it." The
figure said, "I already know how" and "it's in all of us and that's
how it will just spread right across."
The scene changed and Paul went back to when he was a boy.
He was about twelve years old in the cellar of his home when this
episode began. "I 'm fighting. I'm fighting alone. The thing that's
fighting me knows that I'm right here, but I'm protected in some
way, I guess. ' Cuz it can't j ust come out and just kill me. I think
it wants to, though, definitely," he thought as it seemed to lunge
toward him, only to be stopped by some sort of protective barrier.
"But it can't do that. It has to do it in other ways. It's going to
try. It's going to take me apart, little piece by little piece ...
We' ve done this battle before. That's why I'm still here. He says
he fights with everyone like this." The battle seemed mythic to
Paul, as if he were "confronting destruction that wants creation stopped (some people call it Satan)," he said. "I 'm yelling," he said, "but I don't think anyone's around."
In the darkness Paul perceived a glowing, nonhuman creature
staring at him that he called " ' symbolistic' ... It controls humans
to a great degree" and wanted to "destroy" him. But he was protected from "getting lost" by a "creational force" that held him.
Once again he experienced numbness spreading through his whole
body and helplessness. But the creature could not kill hin;l because
"I know too much about who I am and where all my strength
comes from. It cannot cut me off." Death would come through
"isolation," but Paul was "connected through my back" by
"cords" that the creature was "trying to cut." Recognizing that he
was speaking symbolically, Paul said that the cords, which were
"connecting me to parts of myself," were cut by the creature. Experiencing great distress in his body as he related this, Paul said,
"It's too painful. It's too painful to be here. It hurts."
No longer at home in his cellar, Paul now was lying on his
back in his bed at night and experienced " 'things' ... moving
around me." He could not move at all and saw "a thing in the
closet" with a "horror face," like "that character from The Exorcist," that frightened him intensely as a child. The figure seemed
to turn a light on, but receded further into the darkness of the
closet. Paul wanted "to go after it alone." Surrounded by darkness
now, he could still see the figure "huddled in a corner. I can feel
it breathing over there. It's dangerous in a way, but I think it's just
been beaten so badly." He chose to reach his hand toward the
creature. A shift of consciousness occurred and Paul was once
more back in his room. "Yeahhhhh ! Yuck! Okay. It's so broken !
It looks broken. Its arms don't move the right way. They don't
move like my arms do. It's slimy. It doesn't feel like me. I can't,
I can't, I can't understand it. It wants me to understand it."
The creature tried to communicate with Paul and to touch him,
which "is freaking me out ... It is telling me about myself. It's
trying to tell me something about me." The figure told Paul that
"it's me" and that he (Paul) has "the power to make this thing,
and I can't see how I do. I can't see that I do." Once again Paul's
body became numb and he was with the creature in the woods
and they were talking. The figure seemed then to become smaller,
"four feet or so," and looked "kind of like me. It's got eyes and
nose, kinda," except "flatter ... there's not much to it," and ears
that are '1ust like holes in its head ... aw, this is weird lookin' !"
The head was large in proportion to the "thin, thin body." The figure reached out to Paul with a hand that had two or three fmgers
and a "thumb, and "it just wants to talk to me. It doesn't understand why I'm freaking out!"
"Why are you freaking out?" I asked.
"I' m, I'm afraid! It looks really weird ! ... It's just different than
me!" The being "keeps touching me," and Paul could not understand why. "It wants me to understand what it has to say. It wants
me to understand how to be me. It's trying to help me to be me."
Paul now believed he was about nine when this experience occurred Still in the woods he saw a ship behind the creature. "It
keeps tilting its head; but I can't, I can't, I can't talk to it. I don't
know what to say to it." The figure held its hands out to Paul, and
"it wants me to take its hands." But he was too afraid and could
not "open to it like it wants me to ... It's just so different." The
figure pulled Paul by the hands into the ship. "Oh, my God !" Paul
said, and he felt himself pass · literally through the door of the
ship-"it's liquidy in a way, but it's still there." Inside the ship itwas dark at first. He was in a sitting position as several beings
searched his body with their hands, as if "they're confused about
something." Although he felt as if he gave permission to the beings to touch him, he resisted communication with them, which
they did not understand.
The beings wanted Paul to lie down on a table, which he did.
He had no clothes on, could not move, and felt cold. "I don't understand," Paul said, and felt terrified and confused. "They're cutting me open." Using what appeared to be some kind of light the
beings made a seven- or eight-inch-long cut in his right leg above
the knee. The "loose" flesh opened about a half inch, exposing
muscle, ligaments, and bone but creating little bleeding-"It
should be bleeding! Why isn't it bleeding?" The procedure did not
hurt, but the sight of his leg opened up was terrifying to Paul.
''They're just looking into it," he said. Then "they're taking a little piece of my bone." Using "just the light" the beings closed up
the wound, and "now we' re going to talk."
Left alone with his panic, Paul found he had difficulty breathing, which he experienced in our session. He felt that the beings
tried, but could not understand why he was so intensely frightened. The beings explained to Paul that there is "some relationship between us" and that "I'm from them." At this point in the
session Paul experienced a kind of split in his awareness. In his
alien identity he understood that they were trying to help him, but
as a human being "I'm having trouble understanding ·who I am"
and "explaining to other people." The operation on his leg and
"lots of' other things before and since have been done to him by
the beings to "change things inside me" so that he can become
"like a liaison" who can "introduce them" to me and other human
beings. But he was afraid for his "new friends," afraid that "they
are going to get hurt" because "everyone's too afraid of them."
The aliens, Paul said, have taught him many things, like "how
I think" and "how energy works in me." I asked him to explain.
"It's a very powerful thing ... Your thought has great impact on
where that energy's going to go, and they're teaching me how to
be aware of where I want that energy to go. They show me how
to use it. They show me how to feel it in my body. They show
me how to feel it in other people and in other bodies. They're
showing me their technology."
"Like what?" I asked.
"The way · they heal themselves" when they get cut or hurt, Paul
said.
Paul (like many abductees) seems to have been psychically
skilled all his life and appears to grow more so as he recovers material about his alien encounters. What is unusual about him is his
ability to communicate his skills to others in a simple manner.
Pam Kasey has seen him use metaphors from common experience
to enable people to move awareness from one place to another in
their bodies or open to the solution of a problem. By asking a few
simple questions, he can also help people become aware of a level
on which they are already receiving information that they had until then been ignoring. His teaching ability, as Pam and others
have observed, is extraordinary.
Paul explained then that "when they are exploring sometimes
certain ones die," but they can be "collected again" and "brought
. back" (i.e., to life) by the energy of the other beings. ''They make
it [the dead one] absorb, like the energy that is the consciousness"
of one or more of the other beings, because the one that died
"wasn't supposed to die then." He then gave as an example when
"the ship crashed" in "a desert" after "they were shot at by us"
and "there's a couple of them dead."
At this point in the session Paul was puzzled to experience
himself as actually being at the crash site. "I'm just here with
them. I feel like I'm their friend. I know who shot them. Why?
Why did we shoot them? Why did they shoot them? This isn't
right. Men in uniforms. They' re showing me who shot them. I
don't belong with that group. It's the military. It's soldiers. They
shot them. They [the beings] have been hurt. I can't help them."
''Then what happened?"
"All the jeeps are coming. We' re taking off. We have to go.
We're going to leave the rest." I asked if he was one of them or
in human form, and Paul replied "I 'm human." "We have to leave
the crash site," he continued. ''The army's coming and they're going to take everything. They' re taking the ship; they're going to
take the ship." But he saw that his alien brothers were "hurt by
the fear of those men ... They [the aliens] have to show me this
stuff," he said. "I don't like to see it." "Why?" I asked. "I don't
want to be human. I don't want to be human. I'm sorry for being
human. I didn't mean to hurt them." Paul explained that he was
also nine when he was at the crash site, in another ship that went
to rescue the dead ones.
Paul felt anguished that several of his dead "friends" could not
be "collected" and had to be left behind in the desert. He had
wanted to help them and felt sad that "they suffered all because
of the fear of those other people ... the ignorance of those human
beings." His life, Paul said, is devoted to bringing "the awarenessup," but in order to achieve that "I have to love me and let myself
be here." In the session Paul felt his heart "opening up more ...
It feels warm," he said "Things are melting," and he had the feeling of "peace and love ... spreading ... The planet [Earth] is going to grow," Paul said, "by caring for ourselves," but "it starts
with me. I have to accept what I've learned," especially that healing begins in the heart "and then it flows out" The alien beings,
he said, had shown him that "hatred of others" had caused sickness of the heart and that ''the force to grow" was "all around
me ... They [the aliens] showed me to use that [knowledge]."
His own role, Paul said, was to function as a bridge between
the aliens and the human world. "They want me to form a group
that can meet with them. They need us not to be so afraid of
them, to be open, to understand,�' to enter into an "exchange" of
love. It is necessary for him and other humans to confront their
fear if we are "to change this place we live in, that I live in ...
There is much to be done," Paul added, and "I need help to do
this. And I need your help." As the session was coming near the
end, Paul spoke further of his own "need to grow" and expressed
his love for me and Pam. "I can trust you two to help me. Why
do we find it so hard to love each other?'·' We spoke then of the
connection between a personal history of hurt, as in his life, or
even in the experience of the aliens themselves, and the unwillingness or inability to open the heart.
Before concluding we talked further of what appeared to be
Paul's consciousness of an incident like what reportedly occurred
at Roswell, New Mexico, where a space vehicle seems to have
crashed a few days after the first "flying saucer" sightings of our
current era. The aliens, Paul said, did not expect the hostile reception they received. "I felt they came with open arms and they got
a spear right through them ... they got blasted, it seems, and that
really confused everything. They completely don't understand us.
They start to now." But this initial reception made the relationship
"really difficult."
I wondered about consciousness as a kind of "continuous fabric" that allows you to go "anywhere under certain conditions."
Paul's response was complex. He agreed with what I said, but
added, "At the same time, you get, like it flexes in. Your energy,
you could, when you die, you'll like retract a little bit to that core
consciousness, and the memories of who you are still very much
here and very much incorporated into that energy. Very much so!
And it goes back into the whole and the whole grows back again
and then you come back ... The memories are there, but it's kind
of like you push back out again, and you take form again ... you
seem like you feel that independence because you're so focused
into one direction, into one purpose, like coming back molecularly
and drawing from everything, drawing from all because of what
you're connected to ... The lines that you have to where you're
really from are ominous power. It's enormous! But, like, since
you're pushing forward you forget what's behind you. That's what
I think held me. I think those are those cords, in a way, that I'm
feeling behind me, maybe. I'm not sure."
I asked Paul what "form" he was in during this episode. Was
he embodied as a nine-year-old, or was it only a kind of consciousness? He said that he felt "very much like I was completely
me and then everything changed around me to show me an example of what has happened, to help me understand it, right? And so
I'm very much aware of who I am, but everything kept changing
so radically that the information is so spontaneous." Paul had felt
as if his body was literally .. on the ship during this event. "It felt
like I was there. It felt very real."
Reviewing other aspects of the session, Paul observed "that
slimy, broken thing" was his own externalized fear of the unknown. The image in our session was like a feared image from
the film The Exorcist that had terrified him for weeks as a child.
"When I met them [the aliens] and I touch them, and it's, like,
Oh, you're slimy ! And then cold and all this stuff, and that frightened me more." The aliens seemed to resist, even object, to the
confusion of identity or false attribution that occurred here. For
example, when they were taking Paul through the woods to the
ship he experienced the communication from them that they had
"reached out" and wondered "what's wrong? Like, come on.
Like, I am who I am and you are who you are and, like, what is
the problem with you? And they' re trying to get their thoughts in.
They don't want to take you over." He felt they were looking at
him as if to say "Why aren't you communicating with me? How
come you can't accept what you are?"
I spoke with Paul of the difficulty human beings have in accepting and acknowledging the source of power from which we
may come. He responded that "accepting another human being as
a source of information is hard enough. But now [to] accept, like,
nonhumans as a source of information for you, as a guru, as a
teacher-I mean it's amazing what they have taught me now that
I'm accepting it more and more. They may have shown me where
the creational force is. They're the ones that assist in link.fng me
up to it in a big way." Paul reflected on his experience of b�ing"completely doubtful" about the reality of his alien encounters,
which he related to the limited "definition of God" he had experienced in his upbringing as his parents went "from religion to religion." Yet Paul grew up feeling that he "understood the
connection to a source. The terminology and stuff in between is
immaterial." He reflected with awe upon the "unbelievable" technology he had learned from his alien encounters, especially the
"flood of information" he has received about how they heal. "I've
got notebooks full of this stuff," Paul said, "and it's very solid."
A few days later another abductee, Julia, a young woman with
whom I have been working for nearly three years, called me and
spoke about Paul, whom she had met for the first time in our support group. Although they had not known each other "on Earth,"
she felt that she knew him very well from meetings in the ships
(it is very common for abductees to report that they have seen or
been with other abductees who they know on the ships). She
spoke of Paul's "overpowering" personality, which "exudes love."
He is "rock solid," she said, and very "centered." In the environment of the ship Paul has a "presence" and a power similar in
quality to "my doctor"-i.e., the principal alien figure in her
abductions-or to that of any of the alien beings. In particular,
Julia said, Paul has great gifts as a healer, and teaches people like
herself to "pull despair and hurt from people." He does seem to
her and others to have a great ability to carry the pain of people's
suffering and to purge them of i4 especially with the use of his
hands. Julia had never talked individually with Paul, and, of
course, knew none of the details of our sessions.
DISCUSSION
Paul's case is illustrative of an increasing number of abductees
who are not focused so much on the traumatic nature of their experiences but instead are seeking to communicate information that
they feel they have received during their experienced encounters
with the alien beings. Our two relaxation sessions included traumatic material, especially the shock of helplessness and the lacerating procedure done to his leg, but these are of less interest to
Paul than accessing the knowledge he has received during his abduction experiences. This information is concerned with such matters as hum.an fear and destructiveness, our resistance to change,
the necessity of heart .opening and the transformative power of
love, space transporting, healing technologies he says he has
learned from the aliens, the nature of consciousness (especially as
the primal source of creation), and Paul's dual human/alien identity and role as a healer and a bridge between the two worlds. A
central theme in Paul's material is the extreme and unrelenting
quality of human destructiveness, which, although based on fear,
remains bewildering to the aliens themselves. It appears to the
aliens, he says, as if we have deliberately chosen death over life,
and their experiments are in part an effort to understand our perverse, stubborn ways as well as a kind of intervention to move us
along the path from destruction toward creation.
It is difficult to know how to evaluate the information that Paul
has received. In the first place, as he himself says, it is hard to accept the power and knowledge of, let alone experience as "gurus,"
creatures such as these who are so odd in appearance and "shatter" our notions of reality. For Paul, like all of us who are exposed
directly or indirectly to this phenomenon, the first task has been
to accept the fact of his own experience. Furthermore, the accounts that he provides sometimes altogether defy space/time reality. Such space/time traveling might make sense by conceiving
of consciousness as a kind of hologram of universal sourcefulness
which can create matter and form itself and to which Paul, and
each of us potentially, has access if we can open and "let go" as
called for into this primal universal information or energy fabric.
Much of the material of Paul's sessions was concerned with the
form and identity-creating power of consciousness and the
compelling necessity of opening ourselves to its infinite qualities.
What made Paul's communications so compelling and persuasive was the intensity of feeling and bodily movement and sensation that accompanied each new thought. In working with him it
was as if the hypnotist's role was to facilitate Paul's access to
knowledge that was stored within him and that powerfully affected his body as it moved into consciousness and could then be
communicated. The idea of consciousness as an infinite source of
energy and form to which each being has access makes it perhaps
inappropriate to consider each communication of Paul's in terms
of whether it is literally factual or concretely "happened" in linear
space/time terms. I appreciate that this will not satisfy anyone
who would still hold to a view of reality that is limited to the
physical four-dimensional universe. On the other hand, there may
be some value in challenging our restricted epistemology and expanding our criteria for evaluating information to include the
power or intensity with which something is felt and communicated and the potential utility the knowledge may have in relation
to our contemporary dilemmas.Applying these criteria, there is little doubt that Paul experienced the information that carne to him in our sessions as having
great power, as did those of us (Pam and myself) who received it.
Furthermore, the relentless messages of the need for change, of the necessity of human mind and heart opening, and of the catastrophic consequences of our having mistaken the "shell" of our
defensiveness for the whole of human identity-messages which
comprise the essence of the information that Paul has received
and imparted-are all communications of great practical value in
the context of the present global crisis.
Finally, there is the question of Paul himself and my role in his
development and personal opening. Those who know him outside
of the therapeutic setting, such as Pam, Julia, and other abductees,
all testify to his extraordinary intuitive and healing abilities. He
has come to me to enable him to free his powers from the restrictions of the suppression (a word he used both in relation to his
mother's uneasiness in the face of his intelligence and abilities
and his former therapist's inability to deal with the abductionrelated material) that was the result of several sets of forces.
These include the repression of the material locked within him (an
adaptive response when one considers their intensity, Paul's need
to function normally in everyday reality, and the absence of a supportive context in which it could be safe to open himself to such
unusual information), the ontologically shattering nature of the information itself, and the sheer power of the energies involved,
which required the creation of a strongly supportive and trusting
context before Paul could allow himself to bring forth what was
held within.
Paul experiences himself as a bridge between two worlds . He
feels deeply that he has both a human and an alien identity. The
task of integrating these two basic dimensions of himself-a challenge that many abductees who experience this double life must
face-is formidable and is a central aspect of our work. For Paul,
like other ·abductees who feel that they have accessed i:he source
of creative energy in the cosmos, their human identity and participation is intensely painful, especially in the face of the destructive institutions or life systems we have created. ''Home" for him,
as it is for many abductees, is on the ship or with "them." Yet at
the same time Paul feels strongly that he has been given, or chosen, a role on Earth to contribute, as an example in his own being
of openness and love, to the evolution and transformation of human consciousness.

===================================================================
CHAPTER ELEVEN. EVA's MISSION

Eva, at age thirty-three, was working as an assistant to a CPA
when she read an article in the Wall Street Journal that described
my work with abductees. She called my office and said that she
would like to be interviewed because she "may be going through
the same thing" as the experiencers described in the article and
"it's important for a lot of people." In a follow-up telephone conversation Eva told Pam Kasey that she had been having "feelings
night and day of entities . . . dreams" of beings in her room that
are "still there" when she wakes up, and recalled incidents from
early childhood and late adolescence when she could not move as
her vagina was probed by "midgets" who had somehow gotten
into her room.
Eva's unusual encounters made her wonder if she were "crazy."
She had always considered herself to be "a very logical person"
and these experiences contrasted with accepted notions of reality.
Nevertheless, she intended to discover the truths that underlay her
experiences, a determination that fit with her sense of herself as a
pioneer with a "global mission" to help others. Until she read the
article in the Wall Street Journal, Eva felt very much alone in the
struggle with her encounters. The day before her telephone interview with Pam Kasey she wrote in her journal, "I'm trying to
cope with it in my own way. It's hard. No one to talk to. No one
to cry with, to ask for reassurance, for understanding. It's a heavy
burden to carry alone. How can I help Sarah [her daughter]? She's
only six." Although her abduction experiences were disturbing toher, 
Eva sensed from the beginning of our work that they were
connected with some sort of purpose, and that she was a "vehicle"
through which information from another, higher, source might be
transmitted. In January, February, and March 1993 we did three
regressions.
Eva was the oldest of three children, born in Israel. Her father
is a banker and real estate investor whose work has required him
to travel a great deal. The family lived in England, Venezuela,
Florida, and New York as Eva was growing up. She married in
1980 and settled in the United States in 1985. As a child Eva felt
that her creativity was suppressed because of the necessity of deferring to the needs of her father, whom she still respects but describes as cold ("He's not a touching person," she told me when
I inquired about the possibility of childhood sexual abuse). Eva
grew up as a conscientious person with a strong sense of wanting
to please others, if necessary, at the expense of her own freedom
and imagination.
Eva's husband, David, works as an electronic engineer for a
large photographic corporation. Her marriage is somewhat traditional in that the care of the household and children falls mostly
upon her, while David, as . the principal breadwinner, works long
hours at the company. Eva's "personal agreement with herself,"
related to her acute sense of responsibility, included the requirement that no one would be hurt in the process of her personal
evolution. She did not, therefore, tell her husband of her unusual
experiences or her work with me until after our second regression
in February 1993, nine months after she first called my office. Her
concern was not only that David would not understand her experiences, but also that he might be troubled by the information,
which could create uncomfortable tension in their relationship.
Eva and David have two children, Aaron, age nine, and Sarah.
After our first regression in January 1993, Eva spoke of her concern that Sarah was having her own abduction-related experiences. About three or four times a year she was waking up from
"bad dreams." For example, one night a month or two before this
session Sarah woke up in the middle of the night screaming for
her mother. Eva went into her room and Sarah said first that she
had had a bad dream, but then she said that she had seen a ghost
"flying in the room" that was all white . "and he wanted to take
me" and "I didn't want to go." It was clear to Eva that Sarah was
"fully awake" and "fully energized" by what had happened,
though she did not talk about it tile next morning. Eva does not
believe that Aaron was having experiences, but "he's into comput-
ers and spaceships," which he builds in the computer, and "his
imagination is so wild" that "if he would wake up in the middle
of the night and tell me about a dream, I wouldn't know if it was
real or not real."
The first abduction experience that Eva recalls occurred when
she was four or five and living in Israel. She shared a room with
her baby sister, who seems to have slept through Eva's experience. (Further details of this encounter will be reported in the account of the first regression.) Before speaking with Pam Kasey,
Eva had written in her journal that she had started to read Whitley
Strieber's Communion, but discontinued it so as not to be "influenced by anyone or anything ... Then something triggered my
memory," and she recalled waking in the night and seeing "three
'midgets,' about three feet tall." They had dark brown, wrinkled
skin and triangular heads. They stood by her bed and touched her
genitals with what felt "like fingers, probing, kind of experimenting," without force or a sense of sexual urgency or intensity.
She felt helpless and could not move, and when she tried to
scream, no sound came out, at least at first.
In her journal Eva wrote, "They walked through the space
(about !4'') between the wall (external wall) and the door (like
walking through a wall) and disappeared just as my mom entered
the room. I told her there were midgets in the room, that they just
walked through the door. She looked. Obviously she saw nothing.
Told me it was a dream and that I should go back to sleep. I was
scared. Didn't believe her. I was sure they were real. I saw them.
Heard them. Felt them. The first time I remembered this was last
night. I don't know what brought it on. I'm writing this now because I feel it. In my veins. As if it just happened. And I know
it's true because I have goose bumps all over." r
About ten days after our first meeting in October I 992 Eva
wrote in her journal that she was driving to Boston listening to the
tape of her session when she began to recall more details of this
childhood abduction experience. As she listened to the part about
trying to scream for her mother, "I jumped on my car seat" and
"all of a sudden a picture flashed in front of me as a result of
looking at the highway lights. I recalled a spaceship looking like
this [drawing in journal]. It was huge, gray in color, metallic. It
was hovering close to me. And then I saw a face of a female with
big eyes (round and dark) and green (like eyebrows)-light green
all around the eye area and coming almost to the edges [drawing
in journal]. Then the picture disappeared." The recollection wasbtief. perhaps seconds, but very vivid with many details, including
the lines, shape, and structure of the craft.
Eva recalls another childhood incident when she was about six
that she now relates to her abduction experiences. She had developed pneumonia and was taken to an emergency roon1 in a hospital. The bright lights frightened her and triggered a memory of
an abduction experience. In her journal entry of May 22, 1992,
she wrote, .. It's not like a single dentist's light. It's a few of them.
Above you. Like small projectors. And you're on the bed, helpless. And strangers around you. Touching, feeling, investigating,
expetimenting. STOP. No n1ore." When the doctor in the hospital
told her to lie down on a bed and take off her undershirt she refused. Her n1other urged her too, but she still would not lie down
or take off her shirt. Although she screamed in terror, .. they forced
me . . . I absolutely hated it.··
In the altered state. Eva reported seeing a spaceship about a
year later in the grassy area behind the aparttnent complex in England where the family was living. "It's very low. and it has like
three, three things of fire coming out from the bottom. It's gray.
and at the bottom there are, like, oh. what you would call windows. with. like, light coining out." Eva believes "they blocked
my memory so I could not remen1ber ... You remember absolutely nothing," she said. "'Otherwise it intetferes with your daily
life."
Eva believes that the aliens "'have a tracking mechanisn1," and
relates an expetience when she was about nine and still in England to a possible in1plant. S he was doing somersaults on hotizontal bars. missed one. fell. and bun1 ped her head "really hard."
S he says that she felt that "sotnethi ng tnoved'' in her head,
"something they could keep track of me .. :· I asked her if she
could feel it move, how she knew. "I just know." she said . .. They
had their signal" frotn this accident. and they came back and ··corrected it." Again I asked how she knew. "I know." she said.
Two other incidents occmred when Eva was nineteen while
serving in the Israeli anny. In one, which she recalled in greater
detail in the tirst regression. she felt ··as if somebody has given
n1e a shot, a gas mask, I don't know what. to knock tne out,'' and
as she was waking she heard whispers in her room (she was alone
in her parents' apartn1ent at the titne) and ""there was one fen1ale
and two or three males around. I was frozen again ... totally frozen" and '"felt something between my legs ... I was very afraid,
but at the same titne I was tryi ng to be logical and analyze the situation." She •·felt the fen1ale and the male standing over me." At
the time Eva did not think of this "as something extraterrestrial
... I thought it was robbers and waited for them to leave." \Vhen
she was able to move again and looked around there was nobody
there.
The other incident occurred while she was on the night shift in
the air control. At a slow time-perhaps three in the morningshe put her head down to doze and then ·�saw myself floating
from the ceiling ... My consciousness was up there. My physical
body was down there." A "voice said� 'Come with me. it's
goo<L' " and "I knew at that point I had a choice of living or
dying." Although her heart was beating fast and "I was sweating
like crazy," Eva was not aware of any life-threatening illness. She
sai� "I wasn't interested in dying, and I said, 'No, I'm not coming.' " Eva "knew" she could have died but does not understand
why and found the episode confusing.
Eva had two experiences in the month before she read the n'all
Street Journal article that probably sensitized her to its contenL In
the first incident, described in her journal entry of April 14/15, she
woke during the night and saw a "violet rectangle, like a dooiVIay
into/out of somewhere not visible, maybe another dimension." She
saw then "the upper parts of some people wearing wtllte and they
were standing at the front of my bed.'� She blinked her eyes,
thinking "it's my imagination." But "when I opened them again
they were still there. At some point I understood it's real ... I felt
as if they were 'bringing me back home'-whatever that means."
On May 6, eight days before she read the article, Eva wrote in
her journal, "Last night when I went to bed I wanted so to meet
them. I aske� begged, for an encounter. I volunteered myself (my
body) for their examination so they can further their knowledge
about us earthlings. I was just about to fall asleep when I felt a
strange dizziness. A loss of gravity, as if I was swirling into a tornado, as if I was being sucked into somewhere. I knew I could
stop it just by physically touching my husband beside me in bed.
But I knew my wish was granted, and I didn't want it to stop. I
suddenly felt (?saw) a light-blue light encompassing me. It was
light blue, yet there was a white light inside the light-blue one. It
was a soothing light, yet one that I know would lead me to greater
knowledge. It was magnetic. It was the feeling I got from it that
is beyond words. Words are too physically limiting. \Vhen I felt/
saw the light the dizziness/twirling stopped. I went blank. I didn't
sleep well. I know that much. I woke up 2-3 times that night,
finding it difficult to fall asleep again. I was restless. \Vhen I
woke up in the morning I was so tired! As if I went on a journeyall night long. I hope I did. And I wish that someday I will remember those journeys and all about them so I can use the knowledge to help mankind."
The following morning Eva's husband, who seemed to have
slept through the incident, told her that he heard a "big bang" during the night. She felt "full of energy" and filed with "love and
hope." But at the same time she was frightened and wrote in the
journal, "I felt I was really going crazy. I couldn't tell David.
He'd think I was nuts. I w as so scared. Couldn't fall asleep.
Didn't know what to do. I have to get help? ! Somebody I could
talk to. Now it's me and the pen and paper. But I need somebody
humanly to hear me out. With no judgments. No expectations. No
accusations. Somebody with explanations maybe." She continued,
asserting confidently that the beings mean us no harm, that they
are here to help, and "I love them."
In the weeks before my first meeting with Eva in October 1992,
she had several other powerful experiences involving the feeling
of strange presences or the conscious perception of unusual entities, including "beings from a totally different dimension." During
a hypnotic session with a dowser from another state who also did
healing wor� she found herself going back in time to "160 or 1 80
years ago" and "moving from one dimension to another," experiencing a "difference in the energy vibrations" and located "in a
different planet, star, galaxy-1 don't know the name of it." In her
journal entry of September 22, which she wrote after returning
from an energetic healing class, Eva explained that she was "living two dimensions simultaneously ... I have the gut feeling."
The journal entry continued, "I was in a higher dimension where
linear time is irrelevant."
After considerable difficulty in scheduling, Eva and I met for
the first time on October 1 5, 1992. In this interview she provided
much of the information recorded above and expressed the wish
to explore her experiences further with hypnosis. "That's what
I'm here for," she said. But again there were problems of scheduling and postponements, so that our first regression did not occur
until January 1 9, 1993 . But in the weeks before this session
"things started to surface."
In her journal entry of December 6, Eva wrote of a powerful
experience that had occurred the night before. "I was almost
asleep. But not yet I lay down on my stomach, my head to my
left. My eyes were closed. At the tip of my eye I saw a gray
spaceship [she drew the ship and symbols that she saw]. I panicked. I wanted to scream. I couldn' t." She felt that she could
break out of the experience but "I got courageous and convinced
myself to go 'on the ride' but trying to acquire as much info as
possible for P.C. [should be K.] and J.M." After this she "blacked
out" and the "next thing I remember was I was lying on a hard
surface. Maybe two people in the room ... I kept my eyes shut
very firmly because I was so terrified to open them.
"I remember 'them' (?) or me, I'm not sure which, wearing a
dark gray garment/robe with many buttons going down the back.
I was in a fetal position, my back to them. They were doing
something to my spine. My entire spine was stinging and cold. It
was awful ! It felt as if they were going inside my body with some
very sharp instrument (syringe?) and inserting it between my flesh
and skin. The stinging sensation persisted. At one point I started
moving, resisting the situation, although I was at the same time
scared of the consequences of doing so. I tried to get at some
point more data with my eyes closed. The air was moist. The surface I was on was hard and a bit slippery. I had the feeling the
room was not well lighted, but then again with eyes closed I'm
not sure.
"I continued to resist, and at some point understood that they
agreed to bring the situation/experiment to an end. Before blacking out again I remember I saw this symbol [draws it] in red. This
is not the first time I saw this ... Next thing I remember is fmding myself in bed, hearing my husband. I was in a fetal position !
I went to sleep on my stomach. I felt in total panic again, something that didn't happen before. I wanted to wake him up and tell
him I was 'taken' somewhere. I also knew he'd never believe me.
He'd think I was crazy. I thought maybe calling P.C. or J.M.
Didn't want to bother them. It was Sunday morning 5 :30 A.M. I
was shaky the next day. Still am. I'm trying to relax, accept it,
and somehow make sense out of it." She felt "edgy for a couple
days" and tried to "put it in the back of my mind."
On December 22, Eva wrote in her journal of the reluctance
she had had about writing down the details of the above incident
as "writing would legitimize the entire occurrence, and I wasn't
ready for that then." She developed cold or flu symptoms and
wondered if these had been "brought about by 'the abduction' and
being 'bare' on top, and the injection of"whatever it was, etc. The
clothesless me and the injection of a foreign substance might have
caused a reaction in me. P.S. Nobody in my family had a cold/flu
at the time." In our discussion of this incident six weeks later Eva
said that the intensity of the physical sensations she had experi-enced convinced her the incident ''was real . . . I felt the sensations. I felt it hurting. I felt it stinging. It was cold."
Eva came for her first hypnosis, or relaxation, session on
January 1 8, 1993. She felt anxious but curious. "I love the unknown," she said, and we spoke of her determination to proceed
despite the scheduling difficulties over the holidays. Before inducing the regression we reviewed the childhood incident when the
"midgets" had entered her room and the recent episode described
above.
In the altered state of consciousness Eva spoke immediately of
lying on "something hard" with "something above me like hieroglyphics." She felt scared and heard herself screaming. A figure in
black and green came out of what looked like a gray elevator.
"It's cold in the room . . . He tells them to stop. They give me
something, and I feel like I'm being sucked into a white light and
I don't see him anymore. It's morning. I'm a child in Israel. I
don't remember anything, and I just hear my mother telling me to
get up and go to school, to get dressed."
I took Eva back to the nighttime experience itself. She reported
seeing "when they're bringing me back" a gray, "dome-shaped"
craft with red lights over the balcony of her fourth-floor apartment. The bottom of the craft seemed to be a circular rim that
turned and emitted "some sort of light or energy" and "that's their
transportation method." She saw three beings that appeared like
midgets, with brown skin and "all over wrinkled," wearing olive
green and dark maroon suits with black belts. Their heads were
hairless and pear-shaped with very dark eyes, like a "dead blue"
and "mushed" noses . "One was shorter than the other two, and
they were looking at me." Although her mother regularly checked
to make sure that all doors were locked at night, when Eva
screamed for her the beings disappeared as if through a crack in
the door of her room. When Eva told her mother about the midgets and how they had gone through the door, her mother said
"what are you talking about,'' the door was locked, and "it's a
dream." Eva insisted she saw the beings going out, and her
mother repeated " ' It's a dream. Just go back to sleep. ' And I
did." '
I wondered if Eva could recall the beginning of the experience.
She said her father might have read or made up a bedtime story
before she and her sister were left alone to sleep. The bed had a
guardrail so Eva would not fall out. She was awakened by "a
buzz" and said that the beings, who were shorter than humans,
first appeared standing by the guardrail, "and then there were like
searchlights in the room," which came from outside. The beings
seemed to know "who to come for" because "they keep coming."
She felt afraid, "even scared to call my mom," and shut her eyes
and faced the wall in a fetal position ("the best defensive position") to "make it go away." She heard whispering, and the beings
injected something that felt like a needle in her back to quiet her.
This time-the first incident Eva could recall-she said she was
flown from her bed iri a horizontal position on what seemed like
a canvas-and-wood stretcher. Then she was "sucked" into the
darkness outside and into the bottom of ''the ship" in the light that
was "like a beam of special energy" emanating from inside the
rim at the bottom of the craft. Eva felt a mixture of terror and
confusion as she saw her balcony and the building next door as if
from outside the house.
Once in the craft Eva found herself in an "examining room" on
a table with "small people and lights" around her. There were
"lots of green and red buttons ... it would be comparable to computerized systems. But it was different." The little people in the
ship reminded her of the dwarfs in S now White and seemed
lighter than the ones that had come into her room. One of the beings communicated to the others-not to Eva directly-in a voice
that "resembled more ours" that their purpose was only to "experiment with me" and to cause no harm. She was "in shock" and
defenseless as the beings poked her legs, spine� neck, and brow
with "sharp things," as if "they were trying to understand." She
could see a silver instrument with a round tip that was inserted in
her forehead. A white or yellow fluid dripped onto her nose.
The beings seemed to Eva to be both excited and amused "because they kept communicating with each other" animatedly. Perhaps they were being too "intense ... overdoing it," for the leader
came in, communicated something and "slowly, slowly they
stopped ... He agreed with the original purpose, but it's like a
teacher that walks out of the room and the kids in the classroom
start to fool around and do their own thing." The return reversed
the process of the abduction experience; Eva felt herself "like on
a slide coming down back to my bed." Once she was in the bed
"they were standing by the bed guard, making sure I was okay."
Once Eva "regained my physical movement" she "screamed and
they fled."
After recalling this experience, Eva had the sense that it was
"not the first time." Although she could remember no details, she
felt that something had happened when she was two or three years
old. She feels certain that the beings are able to "keep track ofme" and recalled the incidents from age nine described earlier in
which they seemed to have "corrected" an implant that was dislodged during a fall. Eva has the sense that the memories of her
childhood abduction experiences were blocked by the aliens.
I asked Eva directly what the next encounter that came to mind
was. She replied, "I was nineteen� in Israel, serving in the anny,
and I was sleeping. It was in the middle of the night in my parents' apartment, alone, and I woke up because I heard whispering
noises, and I felt and heard like people walking into my bedroom
and into the living room, and I thought maybe robbers or something, so I didn't move." Eva knew the windows were closed and
the door locked, "and if it opens it makes a shrieking sound." She
could not move as she saw "three beings standing there ... They
were whispering, and one of them went out of the room and the
other came back, and they were touching me between my legs,
and I did not understand it because I was not dreaming." In a
panic now, Eva tried to scream but no sound would come. She experienced what felt like fingers, probing inside her vagina. "It was
not pleasurable. It was incomprehensible," Eva said. She thought
perhaps it was her own fingers, but when she checked her hands
"I felt them on the outside of my thighs."
Eva does not know whether this experience occurred in the
apartment or someplace else. Her eyes remained closed throughout, and although there was a lot of light that came through her
closed lids, she thought perhaps it was early morning. The positions of her body she found confusing. "When I was aware of
what was happening it was like I was on my side, but when it was
happening I was on my back. I don't know." After this experience
ended, Eva forced herself to forget it, and until the period when
she contacted me did not connect it with her childhood experiences. She believes that she has had approximately ten encounters
since age eighteen and that the beings are "more interested in the
human after, at the adult stage, not so much as a child."
At this point in the session Eva shifted from the direct reporting
of her experiences to speaking of the motives of the aliens and the
meaning of the abduction phenomenon, based on information she
feels they have given to her. ''Their purpose is to live in unison,"
she said, "not to take anything from us. They want to study us to
see how they can communicate . . . There are different dimensions, worlds existing within worlds," she added, "and to go from
one to the next is like a roller coaster. You need to speed up the
energy, and then you go to another dimension where the reality is
different. In the transition from one reality to another, you feel
like you're contracting and expanding at the same time ...
It's like you become on the one hand, part of everything, and everything becomes part of you," but "at the same time you contract
into an infinitesimal point." This, she said, is "absurd, because it's
two conflicting ideas," but this absurdity contains the "secret of
moving from one dimension to the next."
A shift in Eva's perspective occurred at this point, and for the
remainder of the regression she spoke as if from the perspective
of the alien community, using only the pronoun "we." "It's like
I'm not speaking," she said. The intensity of her experience in this
realm was physically difficult for her and caused pain in the
hands, she said, due to blocked energies. The aliens were gone
and she saw the frame of a white triangle. "It's too intense," she
said, "they can cause damage" to the human body. The beings
emanate "from different dimensions, beyond physical," Eva observed, "and they need somebody that's closer to the human being
who is able to communicate somehow physically with them ...
The i nformation they can relay," she said, "is of such high intensity that they need something to slow it down." The encounters
with human beings do just that, i.e., slow down the transmission
of information.
The i nformation the alien beings bring, Eva said, comes from
another intelligence, a realm beyond the physical world. But most
people disregard it, dismissing it out of fear as "crazy" thoughts
or just "imagination." In order to be receptive to this information
it is necessary for human beings to be able to put aside their preoccupation with daily responsibilities like work, children,
marriage--our customary "unconsciousness." Nevertheless, Eva
insisted, it is important for us to overcome our need for power and
control on this plane and to acknowledge that life exists elsewhere, though "not necessarily in physical form." One of the
problems in reaching us, she said, is that human beings are anchored in the need for "physical proof' through the "five senses,"
which "we" are ''trying to provide." This is difficult, for "we
don't consist of physical data ... We are not in space/time. We
don't have any form ... We are all. You could say I or one.
It does not matter . . . We are an offshoot of I" or "what you
would equal to God." Eva herself is "a vehicle through which we
can convey that information." As the regression ended, Eva
thanked me "for letting us be heard" and felt afraid to open her
eyes.
.. After coming out of the hypnotic state Eva said that the experience seemed authentic to her. "It was me. I know it was me,"she said, "But it was another me." She spoke of the difficulty integrating the world opened to her by the encounters with her domestic life. "What I'm going through now is alone," she said. Eva
noted that she had not been open with her husband about the
changes taking place. "He just gets bits and pieces," she said. I invited her to share what she was going through in my monthly support group, which she appreciated and agreed to do. Then she
talked about her daughter's recent experience with the "ghost"
that was flying in her room. As the session was drawing to a
close, Eva spoke of continuing numbness in her hands but otherwise felt well. She described herself as a "pioneer" and a "warrior," who likes "challenges." But at the same time she feels
"miserable with myself because I don't understand what's happening." She is reluctant to speak of the new information she is receiving out of fear that others will not understand.
After the session Eva had a brief, intense headache, which soon
subsided. She then felt well. She listened to the tape of the session, and found that she was better able to accept the reality of her
experiences than before the session. She especially appreciated
that she had someone to talk with about her experiences who "believes it's not make-believe." She felt full of energy, but wanted
to be able to control it better. Writing in her journal-fifteen
pages on one day-was particularly helpful. Another regression
was scheduled for February 22, a month_ after the first one, aimed
at integrating the abduction experiences with her everyday life as
a wife and mother.
Before the regression began Eva spoke of the difficulty dealing
with "all the garbage that's been accumulating," by which she
meant the tension between her "conservative" daily life, and the
abduction-related intuitive expansion of her self-knowledge. In
having a son and a daughter Eva felt that she had completed "a
circle," and was now ready to focus upon her "global mission,"
particularly her role as "a communicator between humanity and
everything else-ETs, UFOs, call it what you will-higher intelligence." She spoke then of the suppression of her creativity and
the need · to please others growing up described earlier. Perhaps
her mission is to be a healer, she speculated, enabling people to
break away from the unhealthy effects of institutional systems. A
few days before the meeting Eva had a vision of a downwardpointing white and yellow light triangle (commonly a symbol of
the feminine principle or Great Mother archetype) with circles
(usually representing universality, totality, or wholeness) within it.
Before beginning the regression, Eva spoke of her desire to re-

member more of her experiences, to "open up" in the service of
her higher self and to "throw away the garbage." Again Eva defined the difficulty she has navigating between what she called
"the world that defines reality for most people" and the new
realms of her experience. "For me, both are real," she said.
In the first minutes of the regression Eva spoke rather abstractly
about dimensions of reality, what it is possible to perceive and
talk about, cosmic truth, and other such topics. But the bulk of the
session concerned her profound struggle to integrate her daily personal and abduction-related lives, especially the problems of communicating openly with her husband. Her first image was of black
circles surrounded by golden light, glowing "like sunspots" and
"coming toward the earth." Some people perceive this, she said,
but for others it would not exist. She described the object as "energy" that "cannot be perceived by the five senses, but is real nevertheless." Such an "object can be perceived by those who can
attune to that range of communication, and it will be invisible to
all the rest." To perceive beyond the physical range people must
want that communication, she said.
Shifting to her "we" mode, Eva spoke of the difficulty of conveying information about these matters that lie "outside of linear
time and space." She seemed almost to be debating with me, as
if I were a protagonist for a materialist philosophy. "You either
perceive it and it exists, or you don't perceive it and, therefore, it
does not exist. The same thing here [i.e., with the black and
golden circles]. You are trying to perceive it in those certain limitations, but it's· beyond it ... It's like existing and it's not existing
at the same time, and you're trying to make us say, does it exist,
or does it not exist." The debate continued around Eva's "I" Epersonal) and "we" (alien/universal) identities.
The black/golden object, Eva said, was dense, and inside it
were different energies and colors, green, yellow, and red. "The
way I describe the object to you," she said, "is as though· it has
an inside and it has an outside, and it has boundaries, but it really
doesn't. So it's hard for us to put her [Eva] inside or outside of
it." These colors, Eva said, represent different frequencies or "levels of energy, but red doesn't really exist, nor yellow, nor green,
or any other colors." We continued a bit further in this vei� as
Eva talked of information relating to "cosmic truth," trust, communication through colors and vibrations, and more.
But she soon came down to Earth by observing that she suffers
from an "old habit" of "not believing in herself' and the difficulty
of accepting the new aspects of herself that have been "unfold-ing." She has "a very rigid, earthly doctrine," Eva noted. I encouraged her to tell me about that and she said bluntly, "I believe that,
number one, my responsibilities are to my family and to my kids
and all those mundane routine things. Number one. Having fulfilled those, I believe that I'm free to do anything I please or to
manifest anything I believe in as long as NO ONE, and I underline and put it in bold, NO ONE gets hurt in the process, physically, emotionally, or mentally. And if those two things are
fulfilled, then everything else is okay." Now, that's her doctrine.
With the shape of Eva's dilemma now sharply defined, we were
able to proceed with a deeper exploration of it. I said that her doctrine would not work at a cosmic level, that she would have difficulty navigating between her earthly responsibilities and higher
self using such a rigid framework. She suggested that she might
be "Superwoman," but I wondered if spiritual evolution could occur without pain, involving at times others that we love. The discussion continued in a somewhat argumentative vein for a while
with considerable resistance ("dynamic tension," she called it) on
Eva's part, denial of her struggle, and reassertion of her "personal
agreement with herself' not to hurt anyone while at the same time
restating the strength of her motivation to move ahead.
I encouraged Eva to notice what she was feeling in her body.
She said that was hard when "you're a body and you're not a
body" and that I was confusing her. I asked her to tell me again
her husband's name, and she asked me why that was relevant and
then noticed "thumps in my head" like "somebody with a hammer" and "my heart's beating fast." More denial of hurt, confusion, and an objection to being distracted from more abstract
considerations in order to consider her body fol lowed, but Eva did
admit "challenges" to be "transcended into the next step." Then
Eva acknowledged "she's [sic] aching on the right side ... It's
Eva's ache. I feel it now. It doesn't hurt, but it's an ache." But she
said, "You created it!" We went back to her agreement to "not
hurt anybody," and she admitted in rather convoluted language the
problem of reconciling agreements reached outside of "incarnation" or "linear space and time" with those that operate "inside
those limitations of space and time."
The breakthrough in the session occurred when I asked Eva
what "cost" her not talking with her husband and children about
her experiences had for her global mission, to which she had referred in our earlier session, and she replied, "If it would be in
dollars, you wouldn't be able to afford it." Then she added
quickly, "We're joking." She spoke then of her husband's vulner-
ability, especially in pursuing a business career. He is a "great
guy," but appears to have accepted the dominant "earthly perspective" and "belief systems" of this culture and is working in his
job, and "here is this wife of his-<>r he thinks it's his-as most
men in your society do--it's a possession- that it's his wife having these grand travels, cosmic travels . . . How is that going to
affect him?" she asked. I acknowledged the sensitivity of the
question, and asked how ''fragmenting" it was for her not to have
told him of her experiences. "Sometimes it's tearing her [sic]
apart," Eva admitted and spoke of how "miserable she" is in her
job but does not leave because of the "financial situation."
I encouraged Eva to speak from an "f' perspective and wondered again at the sacrifices she was making in the service of her
internal agreement. She objected to the word "sacrifice," but acknowledged that "something is not working." She spoke then of
her plan to leave her job, knowing that this "scares" David, and
reasserted her determination to help others. She will tell him,
''This is me. This is part of me, and this is what I love. And if
you cannot accept it, that means you cannot accept me for what
I am." She wants "desperately" to bring forth her creativity, she
said, and must fmd a "common ground--compromise" with David to be able to pursue her global mission. Eva spoke then of the
tearful encounters she had had in the past when she had tried to
convey to David her determination to follow her own path.
To tell David of her alien encounters will, she anticipates, be
the most difficult challenge of all. "It's like those sunspots at the
beginning of the session," she said, "that gold ring. There's not
such a definite border anymore." She has tried to hide her encounters in "her own little bag" with "a lock on it where she keeps her
journal and your tapings and all that stuff." But phone calls from
our group were starting to come in, and she was gradually "letting
go of that secrecy." David knew, for example, that she started seeing a psychiatrist. So the "borderline" between what "he is to
know or what he is not to know" is "a matter of perception" and
"that borderline will diminish and fade." She intended to tell David "briefly" of her encounters. "Not too much detail is
necessary-just of their existence, and of higher communication
and a general sense of the global mission, and that will be sufficient" I expressed doubt as to whether it would be so simple, and
we discussed the tensions which lay ahead for Eva. Characteristically, she found this prospect interesting and challenging.
As the relaxation session ended, Eva asked to be alone for five
minutes. After this she spoke of a children's book, written in He-
brew, called Soul Bird, which concerns a bird inside every human
being that contains many compartments, "a compartment for anger, a compartment for happiness, a compartment for jealousy, for
love, for hate, and we're the only one that has a key to those compartments. And we decide which compartments we want to use at
any time." Thinking a moment Eva said, "So maybe I should
open up more compartments?" We spoke of timing, and then her
thoughts returned to David. Perhaps in the service of her mission,
she said, she might cause someone else pain. Perhaps it is what
David wants. "Maybe it's something that he's creating for himself,
so he can transcend, as a person, to the next level." She was
thinking about telling him the truth of her experiences more fully,
with the idea that perhaps he can only change his consciousness
"with some sort of major challenge." As the session came to the
end, we discussed the particular restrictions that the corporate
environment places on the evolution of people's consciousness.
Following this session, Eva again experienced an intense headache and was extremely thirsty for a day or two, which she associated to the releasing of energy and her opening to "cosmic
information." In a letter to me two weeks after the regression she
wrote of her attraction to "the challenges of the (consciously) unknown." In journal notes which began with entries three days after
the session, she wrote of plans to go to Israel for the summer and
of "past life" experiences, including an abduction experience as a
five- or six-year-old boy in the seventeenth century (described in
the account of our third hypnosis session, March 1 5). She also described her sense of space/time collapse in relation to the encounters ("past and future are occurring now and forever"), her
longing for global peace and understanding, and set down other
philosophical and spiritual ruminations about the evolution of consciousness and "cosmic truths," inspired by listening to the tape of
the February 22 session.
Writing in the voice of her cosmic we/she, Eva described the
need of the beings to "adjust our communication from higher vibratory levels to those of earthly (verbal) vibration." To "slow
down" in this way and "vibrate at more subtle levels ... takes
training ... We are using Eva's body with her consent full time
now. Earthly Eva has not left, but she has diffused with us so that
her earthly powers have been greatly enhanced, so to speak." She.
warned of the limitation of using words to describe such profound
experiences, especially the relation of the earth plane of existence
to other realities.
In the journal she wrote of telling David about her experiences
soon after our session. "He didn't show much interest. Support in
any form was nonexistent. I wasn't surprised. Didn't expect otherwise. I'm not resentful. Totally accepting. My hypothesis: he's
both in denial and hurt." Although David insinuated he is part of
the game, Eva told me later that she is uncertain about whether
his claims of involvement are genuine. He said they left a mark
on his foot, that they are midgets, and he's seen them, but he
didn't seem to show much interest. "Whether he's an experiencer
for real or not, time will tell . . . However, he said they should
contact him. He's got much info to give. He also suggested that
to get rid of the fear I should teach them a game we could play
together. And they can teach me one of their games. Interesting to
note that from the following morning the fear subsided to almost
zero. And the red spot on my nose appeared two days after that.
It's like through a dream, except the suggestion was taken up by
both sides and the fear worked itself out!"
Also soon after the February session, Eva had a dream of burning houses, which she interpreted to represent the "burning 'garbage' that needed to be burned up in relation to other people."
She also sent two journal entries from the previous summer. In
one she described being outside "planet Earth" and seeing a
spaceship surrounded by a golden light. She was able to communicate telepathically with the entities on it and learned that she
was much loved and that she would eventually be reunited with
them. "I was ageless yet a young soul." In the other entry she described a past life as a teenager in the 1930s or during World
War II. She saw a baby in her arms, and believed that this experience explains her love for all children. In a note on March 9 that
accompanied a gift of fruit and other food in commemoration of
the Jewish redemptive holiday of Purim, Eva wrote, ''Thanks to
you and others, I am learning to regulate the energies more productively."
We scheduled a third relaxation session for March 15. At the
beginning of the session Eva described how before a lecture at her
energy and healing school, she went to take a nap, could not fall
asleep, felt restless, listened to music, "and then it started." She
saw herself as a five- or six-year-old boy in the mountains somewhere in Europe. She lived with her father, a husky, blond-haired
mcln, in a log cabin. She described their clothing, including the detailed designs on their white aprons. "We had something on our
heads like a yarmulke, like a cap or something." Turning to the
left she saw a "saucer, spaceship." A few minutes seemed to pass,
and "I was walking towards this spaceship and my father then andthere was frozen. I mean, he couldn't move; he couldn't speak.
He was like, you know, ice." As the boy, she saw "one of the
midgets again coming out." Next she was in the ship, which took
off as she looked down through the window at her father, who
''unfroze" and looked up with tears in his eyes. "It's like he understood. It's like he knew all along," that "physically I was given
to him through conception" but that- in another sense she was not
his child. "He just accepted what was going on.
"I remembered those midgets again," Eva continued, the "same
ones that I remember when I was four, five years old. The eyes
again, were very dark, but I felt a lot of emotion in them, a lot of
compassion, a lot of love. It's like we' ve come back for you,
something like that, and then I remember a lavender color, and
that's that." Somehow she felt the year was 1652. This experience
further persuaded Eva that she was "not from here," not "earthly."
The "ETs," she said, "have the ability to enter into our space and
time dimension or leave it any time they want." She related this
ability to the 1652 experience. "It's like I was brought to Earth-I
don't know why I was brought for six or five years, or however
old I was at the time, and then I was taken out to another dimension that has no space and time as we know it." Eva in this life
feels she is "an energy form given a body to carry out a certain
mission," which has to do with some sort of full experience of
"life in earthly terms."
There followed further discussion of the difficulties of perception and communication between the alien or spirit cultures and
earthly forms and the choices that our souls make among the "infinite probabilities from which we can choose," one of which is to
become embodied on Earth in a particular time and place. Eva
then reviewed her communications with David about her experiences. With him and others she has been talking "about such
things where I would never think of it before." David seemed to
be "in a state of shock at the beginning," followed by "big denial." Now he speaks somewhat sarcastically about "your friends
from the other side" who "are this, that, or the other." Eva described further abduction-related experiences, with "different procedures, surgeries, call it what you will" to remove energy blocks.
She says she has discovered blue and red spots on her hand,
breast, and other places on her body that have not gone away.
Eva hoped to learn more about the 1652 material under hypnosis, and I cautioned about trying to target specific experiences.
"Deep inside," she suggested, perhaps we ''know where we're going to go already before we come here." She suggested that the
ETs themselves "that we physically see" are "just a form they
take when they enter this dimension ... Wherever they come
from," she said, they "don't live physically per se that way." Their
souls can manifest in different forms. "That's why we get different pictures" of the beings she said. "Some people call it reds,
grays, browns, you know, with wrinkles, without wrinkles,
whatever-it's a combination of their biochemical energetic
makeup and our perceptive devices ... But there will be some
common ground," she added.
Eva's first image in the session itself was of being a four- or
five-year-old girl swimming with dolphins that were her friends
inside a cave. Some force pulled her out of the water, but "the
dolphins will wait." The little girl was drawn from the "memory
of the source" of her being into a domain of "growing up and responsibility." This loss of memory is necessary, she said, "because
in the physical world if the memory of the source would be there,
there would be no initiative to experience, so all would just lay
back." I took her back to the li ttle girl's experience in the cave.
"She keeps coming back, incarnated for a mission," Eva said. Becoming quite abstract, she continued, "the energy makeup of the
little girl will change with experience." Her energy will become
more subtle and higher "until from a certain perspective you can
say there is no energy vibration. It's all one and the process begins
again."
Abductees, Eva said, "are souls that have, for their individual
purposes and reasons, chosen the probability of physical form."
But through their experiences they "are regaining their memory of
source . . . The process of abduction is one form of such, of regaining of memory." The abduction "experience itself," Eva said,
"is a mechanism to remove" the "structures that impede the
reconnection with source," and "to purify the physical vehicle in
such a way to serve to regain better memory and to bring knowledge to others." The "physical and emotional torture" of the abductions themselves, she said, is part of a balancing process. She
herself "never really feared," and "if there was fear it was more
due to not being able to understand what was going on, not fear
as something horrible and dark and evil and unknown. In a way,
the process always felt familiar."
I asked Eva what she meant by familiar. The abduction experiences "felt familiar. It felt home. It's, it's never felt unknown," she
said. I asked how far back her memory of abduction experiences
went. She remarked about "past lives" in World War I and II and
"in Morocco long before that." Her "drive" in each instance was"to help mankind overcome blindness." I asked about Morocco.
She said she had been a rich merchant named Omrishi in the early
thirteenth century who was trying to "undermine" corrupt officials
of the hereditary ruling family that dominated the local government of the village. Omrishi was well known because of his
wealth and his reformist "ideas and ideals." He organized militia
groups to obtain greater economic equality for the villagers and
sought to infiltrate the local government with his supporters. Part
of his plan was to create chaos within the village that would make
it easier to overthrow the ruling family and cause its members to
flee, but he was betrayed by a woman who overheard one of his
plotting conversations and reported this to the officials.
She described how men on horseback dressed in black with
white headdresses-"the bodyguards of the ruling family"-came
to Omrishi's tent to arrest him. The women around him cried and
the children hid, for they knew what was going to happen. He was
taken to a white stone building, which smelled foul from people
puking and urinating there. Omrishi was to be beheaded, and the
people were told to gather in the center of the village to watch the
execution, for they wanted "to deepen the fear in them." After his
arrest Omrishi was taken from his cell to see where the beheading
wquld take place. The following morning at ten o'clock "they
took me, they got my head on the thing, and plop." The feeling
was one of "release, freedom," of "going up, expanding, joy ... There is no descriptio�" she said. "All I feel is white light, gold
light." She saw a dove released from a cage "that's symbolically
me ... That's my soul."
I asked Eva to speak further of the "journey" of her soul and
her thoughts returned to the little girl swimming with the dolphins. Tiris represented "the path of the child's soul" that returns
to the "physical dimension from time to time" for several reasons.
One is to "experience physical life, physical body, physical sensations and perceptions, feelings, emotion, pain, and everything that
the physical world offers." In addition, by "understanding through
experience" souls can "return from time to time" to physical form
"to help those who have not yet remembered." Omrishi, for example, had planted a "seed within people's hearts," and "through
earthly time, the seed will sprout into a tree and the tree will bear
its fruit."
I asked Eva about the role of abduction experiences in this
process. "To clean the body, physical body, in order for more information to come through," she replied. ''They [the aliens] have
always been here. It's a matter of evolution if we are able to per-
ceive them," she said. 'There's times in the evolutionary process
of mankind when they were around but we were not able, it was
not right, the time was not right for us to perceive them." Omrishi
perceived them not as coming in spaceships but through "higher
communication" and meditation through which he received guidance.
"All people have guidance," Eva said, "but most don't listen to
it." Abductees "are at the level where they are able to cleanse ...
to bring information through ... Abductions are very real, physically speaking," Eva said, but people should not emphasize that
aspect too much. 'They should balance the data to comprehend it
as a whole, and not try to prove that they exist or do they not exist." The focus should be on "the information given by abductees . . . That information should be gathered and developed on
the physical plane to be of use. Time is wasted trying to prove or
disprove the existence." (Eva spoke of my own extremes of intellect and unconditional love, a "cosmic tension," and advised me
to "go to a retreat" in an isolated place without other people in order to balance these polarities and "connect your being to the cosmos." Picking up emotions of sadness and loneliness in me she
said, "You need to know that you are never alone. Just ask for the
connection and you'll feel us," i.e., "all of the nonphysical beings
that have been guiding you all along.")
For Eva this session was the most powerful of all. Its impact,
she told me two months later, was "totally beyond words to describe." She felt "very much at home" with what came up in it,
like "the actor and movie seer at the same time." She saw her life
as Omrishi as part of the evolution of her pioneering role in bringing about "peaceful change" toward "harmony between people."
She doubts that Omrishi, from his thirteenth-century perspective,
was consciously aware, "you know, of the bigger picture." He
was simply seeking to do "something for his people in that
place." He began a "communication," but the larger objective of
bringing peace and equality to people remained for the future.
DISCUSSION
It seems to me that Eva is a pioneer with a global mission of healing and peace. Her lifelong abduction experiences are a powerful
vehicle for the evolution of her consciousness and they bring her
in touch with the depths of her purpose. She experiences the abduction encounters as important sources of "information," emanating from dimensions beyond or outside of physical reality. Shefeels herself to be "an energy form given a body to carry out a
certain mission." Like most abductees, Eva has had disturbing,
even terrifying, encounters with alien beings. But her determination to give herself to the process, to surrender the need to control
and resist its intensity and meaning, has enabled Eva to move beyond fear and trauma to a place of greater inner balance and personal power. It is characteristic of her to write in her journal
.. following an abduction experience that left her feeling very tired
that she hoped she had been taken "on a journey."
In Eva's descriptions of her abduction experiences there
emerges a consistent picture of the evolutionary purpose of the
alien-human relationship, at least as it affects our consciousness.
She repeatedly describes the access she gains during her abduction
experiences to another dimension (or other dimensions) of existence, an expanded reality in which human concepts of space and
time do not apply. This realm abounds in paradox-with the
sense, for example, of expanding to infinity and contracting to a
single point at the same time. Although Eva is quite articulate, she
finds her words fail to convey the ineffable beauty and power of
this spiritual realm. Abductees, she says, are souls that have "chosen the probability of physical form," and the abduction experiences are a vehicle for regaining memory of the source of being,
from which, at least in our culture, we have been largely cut off.
Eva herself, like many abductees, seems to exi st in both
embodied-human and alien form. During our sessions when she
would move deeply into her abduction experiences, the alien or
"other" identity would take over. Then she would speak from the
perspective of a kind of cosmic "we" or "us" that seemed to be
in touch with the possibilities of a higher consciousness which
could translate into peace and harmony on the earth plane. Essential to this expansion of consciousness is the breakdown of boundaries, the overcoming of separation of human selves from one
another and from the entities, including the aliens themselves, that
populate the spirit realms.
From her "other'' perspective, Eva is aware of the higher or
more intense energy levels on which the alien beings exist and the
complex problem of adjusting their intensity downward in order
to manifest on the earth plane. Eva senses that even the physical
forms that abduction phenomena can feature-humanoid beings,
spaceships, travel of our bodies through walls-may represent adaptations of higher energy forms to the perceptual requirements of
restricted human consciousness, a technology for reaching us in a
language we can understand. It would appear the aliens, or the
source from which they emanate, must create physical forms for
us to know them.
Eva's access to "past life" experiences seems to be part of the
process of the expansion of her consciousness beyond a purely
physicalist or materialist perception of reality. In this area, the
alien beings appear to function as spirit energies or guides, serving
the evolution of consciousness and identity. The thread of her personal mission can be detected in the "past life" experiences that
she has related to me. For example, as Omrishi, a well-to-do Moroccan merchant in the thirteenth century, she seems concerned
with justice and equality, though on a more local scale, and as a
small boy in the seventeenth century she describes discovering
that her soul does not belong to her earthly parents but to a larger
realm of being.
For Eva, the integration of her personal evolution, as experienced through the abduction encounters, with her domestic responsibilities has been a formidable task and an important aspect
of our work. Her agreement with herself never to hurt anyone ran
head on into the inevitable tension that arose between her spiritual
life and her relationship with her husband, who was embedded in
the conservative and practical demands of the business world. Eva
had sought to keep these lives totally separate, but found the fragmentation of her sense of self increasingly intolerable. A storybook from her childhood called Soul Bird, that told of the
compartments of feeling each of us carries within, seemed to capture the struggle to achieve inner peace that Eva was undergoing.
She was eventually able to bear the distress of telling her husband,
David, about her encounters, and though she was disappointed by
his initial casual response, she was heartened by the fact that he
offered a practical suggestion about how to communicate with the
aliens and hinted that he too may have had some sort of contact
with them. Quite isolated when we met, Eva is increasingly finding ways of speaking with other people about the truth and power
of her experiences and knowledge.
Eva's last regression began with the memory of a little girl
swimming with dolphins in a cave who must leave to assume
other, more grown up, responsibilities. "It's dark, but it's not
dark . . . We play together, and they are my friends," she said.
This image, to which we returned later in the session, seemed to
represent for Eva the soul's journey through the experience of
time, the cycles of rebirth and death, of incarnation, and the return
to spirit. The image is timeless and intimately connected with Eva's mission, an embodiment of the dream of peace, harmony,
equality, and playfulness to which her life is committed.
Eva warned of considering the abduction phenomenon in too
narrowly materialist terms, and discouraged us from wasting our
energies trying to find proof for its reality by the methods of the
physical sciences. Implants, for example, she wrote me after her
first three regressions, are not likely to provide the definitive
proof that abduction researchers are seeking. For to be sustained
within our bodies, she explained, they would have to be composed of substances that would not be rejected by our tissues, i.e.,
would need to contain elements with which we are familiar on
Earth. "I personally continue to believe," Eva wrote, "that our focus should be on mutual communication of some form and on
some level with our alien friends, learning, accepting, and integrating alien wisdom within our world and culture. Time, money,
and energy spent solely on providing proof of alien existence is
fruitless."

==============================================================
CHAPTER TWELVE. THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN

Dave was a boyish thirty-eight-year-old health care worker in an
isolated community in south central Pennsylvania when he called
me in June 1992 at the suggestion of his Korean karate and Tai
Kwan Do (Chi) teacher. The teacher was familiar with my work
with abductees and thought that his student's experiences might
be related to the phenomena that I was studying. I was not available when Dave first called, so my assistant put him in touch with
Julia, an abductee with whom I had been working for two years.
Julia spoke with Dave several times and encouraged him to write
to me of his experiences.
In his letter, written in July j ust before a powerful abduction experience in which he reports having seen a being staring at him
through a window, Dave told of possible abduction experiences
dating back to age three, an unexplained crescent -shaped scar that
had appeared on his body, several missing time episodes, and a
vivid UFO sighting at age nineteen. In addition, he wrote of his
training in karate and his struggles to control the Chi experiences
he was having in and outside of his classes through the work with
his teacher, Master Joe. At the end of the letter he added without
commentary, "I would like to be hypnotized."
On July 23, Dave and I spoke on the telephone and he reported
more conscious recall of his abduction experience two weeks
earlier, including the feeling of something being stuck in his anus,
the compelling and controlling eyes of the creature in the window
who seemed to be female and familiar, and how he found himself
curled up by his wife on her side of the bed after the episode was
over.
Dave's experiences include the traumatic elements that seem to 1
be common in UFO abduction experiences. His case is of special
interest, however, because of the possible connection between the
abduction experiences and his training in the opening and mastery
of his Chi energy, which Dave defines as the "force which pervades the universe from which reality arises." As this opening has
occurred Dave has been astounded by the number of synchronicities-events in his life which seem to be meaningfully
connected-that seem to surround him. Possessing from childhood a lively, practical interest in the out-of.:doors, Dave's abduction encounters and experiences with primal energies have filled
him with awe before the powers of nature.
Dave has been drawn in particular to Pemsit Mountain, a place,
as he describes it, of Native American tradition and magic near
his home where many of his experiences have occurred. The universe has become for Dave a place filled with mystery and
strange intelligence. As he takes responsibility for the power of
his experiences, including two "past lives" we explored in our last
session, Dave is becoming a leader in his community in the exploration of anomalous experiences. Other abductees are attracted· to
him, and he is considering changing his career so he can use hypnosis with them and provide support by leading groups. He has a
strong interest in nature and photography, and sent my wife and
me several lovely pictures of wildflowers he had taken. Dave and
I first met on August 1 3, 1992, when he came to Boston to explore his experiences.
Dave grew up in a small, close-knit, hillside community of
about twenty houses by a creek in the Susquehanna Valley region
of Pennsylvania-"it's the ridge and valley section of Pennsylvania. There's long, parallel ridges, and there's gaps in the mountains where the river runs through. I guess the river was already
there, and then the mountains rose and made gaps." His town was
at the base of the mountain. Dave's friends came from among the
neighbors, and the mothers "were like all of our mothers." He
could go out whenever he wanted and enter the other houses without knocking. "My grandmother lived down the street, my uncle
lived next door." It was "my clan, right there."
Dave is the oldest of four boys. His brothers are three, six, and
nine years younger. Their grandfather had a plumbing, heating,
and fuel oil business and their father worked for him as a fuel oil
salesman. Dave and his mother were always close. All three of his
brothers appear to have had abduction experiences as does the son
of one of them, who does not wish to be identified.
Dave's grandmother was an avid bird-watcher and taught him
how to identify birds. As a child he began to develop a deep love
of the natural world and after age nine or ten began exploring the
woods and the mountain near his home. His father first took him
fishing when he was five, and later he began hunting and trapping. When Dave was an adolescent he "spent a lot of time up in
the mountain or down along the creek." He grew up feeling a
strong kinship with the Native Americans of the region. "The Indians," Dave wrote to me, "attached special spiritual significance
to white deer," and he also feels a strong connection with them.
"I am, you know, spiritually attached to deer. Seems the deer is
my totem animal," he has said.
\Vhen he was seven years old, Dave lost his right eye as the result of a "sword fight" with sticks he had with another boy in the
neighborhood. According to Dave, the boys were jousting with
pieces of a branch of a fallen tree. Dave's mother called to them
to stop and Dave laid his stick down and sat on the ground by a
tree. The other boy picked up Dave's "sword" and broke it against
the tree. One of the pieces flew into Dave's face, slicing the eye
and cutting his face below it. Blood poured from his eye, and he
was taken to a doctor in the town and then to the local hospital.
Dave was operated on with ether used for general anesthesia
The surgeon was unable to save the eye, which was removed.
Dave had not been told beforehand that there was a possibility he
might lose the eye, and still did not know it was gone when he
woke up with a patch over it. He does not recall asking questions
about what had actually been done during the operation, but remembers that he had "terrible nightmares" during the nights afterwards, with loud screaming that led the nursing staff to walk him
up and down the hall while the other children on the ward yelled
at him to "shut up." Dave's father did not tell him until several
days later that his eye had been taken out and he would have to
"wear a fake eye." Later his father told Dave that he was so upset
after he told Dave what had happened that "he went out on the
front steps of the hospital and cried about it ... He told me that
I'd handled it better than he dic:L" Dave said. It was characteri stic
of Dave's father not to show strong emotion until he had a stroke
ten years ago. "Since then he's had trouble controlling his emotions and sometimes he cries." Dave himself never grieved the
loss of his eye until many years later when he was able to cry
with his wife about it.
Dave recalls resolving at the time not to let the loss of his eye
affect him. "I can still see fine, and it doesn't hurt/' he said to himself. He was in the second grade then and there were only six other
pupils in his class and about seventy-five total at the small school,
"so everybody knew what happened and everybody knew me real
well. So nobody teased me about it." But later, in junior high
school, the classes were much larger, and he was called "crosseyed," even by children who knew that he only had one eye.
Dave attended Penn State College for one semester when he was
seventeen, and then completed his studies at a community college.
While still in college he began on-the-job training as a health care
worker, as there was no formal schooling available in this work at
1 the time. When he was about twenty-five, Dave felt he was ready
to marry and have children, "but I didn't meet the right person to
marry until I was thirty-two." Dave's wife, Caroline, is the oldest
. of four children. They had thought to have children soon after mar­
: rying, but their first home did not have "enough room."
The couple borrowed money so they could build a larger home,
but it ended up costing much more than expected. Dave also herniated a disc in his back while building it himself, which kept him
off his feet and out of work for several months. By the time they
moved into the house in June 1992 "we were both four years older,
and at that point we didn't know if we wanted to have kids or not."
Dave denies that his UFO/abduction experiences have interfered
with his sexual life or are connected with his decision not to have
children. His and his wife's basic relationship, he says, "is very
good."
The first experience that Dave relates to the abduction phenomenon occurred when he was three years old. In his introductory
letter he wrote that he remembered "three motorcycles coming
down the street towards me in an unnaturally fast way. \Vhen they
got past me there seems to be a gap, and then they were past me
and raced up a footpath off the road towards a friend's house. I
walked down there and they weren't there." In our first conversation in August 1992, Dave added that the motorcycles seemed to
come at him "too quickly," that he had felt gripped by fear, and
that the "riders" were "black." He also recalls being "astonished"
that the motorcycles could have raced up a dirt footpath at such
a speed, especially as the trail ended at a stone patio of the
friend's house and went no farther. He also remembers having the
same feelings, "a vibration of some kind, a tingling," that he had
in association with later abduction experiences. Dave and I explored this experience in detail in his second relaxation session.Dave's next recollection related to when he was about twelve.
He was exploring in the woods on the mountain near his home,
as he often liked to do. He remembers finding himself on a path
that led to an intersection with two other paths where there was
mossy ground and a tree overhead. "It was a beautiful spot,"
Dave said. "I was looking at it in awe of it, saying, 'This is so
beautiful !' I looked up at the branch of the tree, and then that's all
I can remember." He says that a gap in time occurred, and the
next thing he recalled was "walking onto the patio below our
house." Over the next week or two, Dave returned repeatedly to
this area, but found no trails or ground of the sort he recalled in
the experience. Looking back, Dave explains that he felt "the state
of consciousness I was in" before the time gap occurred was
somehow "different," stronger, "more acute" than normal.
Another similar episode occurred in the same time period when
Dave was at his uncle's summer cabin. He recalls walking along
a path that followed an old railroad bed near a lake. Again he remembers looking up into the branch of a tree, and then recalled
nothing else "until the next thing I knew I was walking back into
the clearing where [the uncle's] cabin was." What to Dave was a
walk of a few minutes had apparently turned into forty-five minutes of missing time, and his aunt, uncle, and cousins were "real
worried." His cousins said they went out to look for him, and after he returned demanded to know where he had been. But he
could not remember anything that he could tell them.
Dave remembers that as a child he was interested in "flying
saucers," which he thought might be related in some way to his
experience at age three. Also, "My dad had said something about
people seeing flying saucers, and I, ever since then, was, had a
sense of wonder about them." In junior high school Dave was in
the honors program. He was fourteen and wrote his only term paper, in preparation for entering high school, on UFOs, but he does
not remember what he said. At the time he told his former Sunday
school teacher about the paper and she said that she had seen
UFOs land and take off from a point on the mountain near where
she lived.
Other things happened during his teenage years that seemed
odd to Dave. He says that when he was fifteen, he and his nextdoor neighbor found a cave with an entrance about twelve feet
across that was by "the end of the mountain where it drops off to
the river." His friend wanted to go into it, but Dave felt afraid and
said, "No, no, I'm not going in there."
"It's not that big of an area," Dave told me, but he was never
able to find the cave again. A year or so later, he said that he was
driving with friends at night in a hard rainstorm across New Brunswick, Can� traveling at about sixty-five mph when a Greyhound
bus "flew past us," going perhaps ninety mph. Dave was asleep in
the backseat when he was awakened by his friends exclaiming
" 'Holy shit!' or something like that" They had just realized that
"we just lost ninety miles . . . last time we knew we were ninety
miles back down the road" It appears that none of the boys could
account for the missing time, but they heard on the news of a terrible bus accident in which sixty-five people had been killed.
\Vhen Dave was nineteen, he reports having had a close-up
sighting of a UFO, which affected him deeply. He was with his
younger brother Ralph and a close friend, Jerry. His parents had
moved a little ways out of the valley to an acre-plot of land on the
side of a hill. It was a very clear night, and the boys were lying
in the yard, "propped up on our elbows," across from a large farm
field. Then "this light rose above the mountain" on the horizon
and "immediately it made a right-angle turn and started to go out
toward the river, and it stopped and started to go out back to the
valley, and then it stopped and started to come towards us. It was
coming towards us for a long time, and none of us had said anything to the other ones about it, and then I looked over at them
and realized they were also both watching it." The boys considered that it might be a large jet, but they thought it was too close
to the ground and silent to be an airplane.
Then the craft came to a stop right above them, Dave continued, and a little to the right. It stopped again and seemed to pivot
"so that its bottom was pointed straight at us. A blue-white light
started to come out in a ring of dots (lights) on the bottom of the
craft. They strobed and it shot straight away from us [he made a
whooshing noise at this point] and then stopped. Then the bluewhite light flickered out of the back of the craft and then began
to glow very brightly ... It took off like out of a slingshot, like
out of a catapult. It just took off. It started going quickly right
away. It just kept going quicker and faster and faster, and it went
at an arc into the sky. It didn't go in a straight line like a plane.
It went at an ever-increasing angle of up, and the last point we
saw, it had to have been going up into the sky at a forty-fivedegree angle, and nevertheless, it disappeared over our horizon
within about ten seconds."
After the UFO disappeared Dave reported saying, " 'Man I
wonder where that thing is now !' and Jerry said, 'Could be over
China!' and I said, 'Yeah, could be at the moon.' " Then the boys
"ran pell-mell up to the house, and we got my parents and my
brothers to come out." They yelled, "We just saw something!"
and they all ran out, "but there was nothing there to show them."
During the encounter with the UFO Dave had had the sense that
"something maybe partly bounced back and forth between me and
the craft . . . I felt some sort of gap there, some confusion at that
point ... I wonder if that blue light had some effect on us," he
said. "It was a blue-white light. Very intense." A few weeks later
Dave recalls reading about reports of UFO sightings in his area
during the period when he saw the craft.
Jerry, who is a generally quiet person, could only say over and
over, "Well, yep." Although Jerry, who acknowledges the UFO
encounter, does not admit to abduction experiences, Dave believes
that he is an abductee. Ralph was also powerfully impressed with
the sighting. Dave describes experiencing a strong sense of wonder at the time and had the thought "I didn't think that whatever
was inside of it could be human." He also believes he saw a face
in the craft "looking down at me," and when he later saw the picture of an alien on the cover of Communion he was shocked, for
"that's what I imagined was looking down at me when I was
nineteen." The large head and black, slanted eyes, in particular,
resonated with Dave's experience. ·
In his initial letter, Dave wrote that he "considered this craft to
be the most impressive piece of technology" he had ever seen. He
began to read everything he could find about the unknown, "hoping to find a clue" as to what was inside that craft. In particular
he read the Castaneda books, and thought about "personally acquirable magical power." He also became interested in Tibetan
Buddhism and discovered "that the Tibetan Buddhists purportedly
knew all about UFOs."
In 1988, soon after reading Communion, Dave had a dream
which to him reflected the power of his Chi energy. In the dream
a Hispanic man was holding a mastiff which was lunging ferociously at him. The man put the dog in a cage, so he decided it
was safe to walk around him. The man put two fingers of his right
hand on Dave's right shoulder and he was pinned to the ground
as by a ton of weight. Then the man let the dog out of the cage,
and "I resigned myself to die, in this dream, which I felt was reality. I couldn't tell I was dreaming." In his first letter, Dave
wrote, "All of a sudden I was overtaken by a feeling like a rage
that started in my chest and went down below my navel. It came
out of my body at this location in the form of energy. It was like
a rocket. It was incredible. I was hurled backwards at a high rate
of speed. I felt the man and dog were flung off of me like they
were nothing." Dave described landing on the side of the bed opposite from where he had gone to sleep. He would have landed on
his wife, but she had gone to work.
In the last few years Dave and his neighbors and friends report
having had a number of UFO-related experiences and "strange coincidences." For example, Rob, one of Dave's neighbors, was
killed in an automobile accident in February 1990, nine days after
helping frremen put out a chimney frre in Dave's house. According to Dave, several years earlier Rob had seen a huge ball of
light in the woods at the end of Dave's driveway and then had had
a missing time period of about forty-five minutes while walking
to Dave's house to see it more closely. Rob had reported seeing
UFOs about six times over the field across the road from the end
of Dave's driveway, and also told Dave that "he saw a UFO while
we were watching the frremen and a strange mood overtook him
and he ran to help them."
In October 1990, Master Joe, now Dave's karate teacher, obtained a part-time job in the department where Dave works. Dave
discovered that he was a seventh-degree black belt karate master
and had learned "secret knowledge about this [Chi] energy from
his master instructor, a Korean, who learned it in a Buddhist monastery in Korea." Master Joe is reported to have had someone
drive a seven-thousand-pound truck over his stomach while lying
on broken glass. Dave began to discuss Chi with Master Joe during the fall and winter of 1990--91, told him of precognitive experiences he was having, and started karate lessons that winter.
Dave says that he and Master Joe have been working on opening Dave's Chi channels, which creates a tingling sensation. This
· power is said to emanate especially from an area the Koreans call
the "Dungan," a region below the navel which is related to the
will. According to Master Joe you "make power" in the fingers
and other body parts, and control Chi with the eye's and mind.
"My whole goal in karate," Dave said, is "to learn to control my
Chi." In his first letter to me, Dave wrote that he had had about
four Chi experiences while in the karate classes. In these experiences he says he witnessed himself performing unusual physical
feats. One morning he awoke from a dream and was "ready to
push my Chi out in front of me." To his dismay, he says, he ended
up pushing his wife out of the bed without having any sensation
of actually touching her. This experience helped Dave to resolve
to learn to control his Chi energies .
In September 1991, Dave experienced a powerful synchronicitythat Master Joe believed was connected with his Chi energy. Before going on a vacation with his wife to a national park in North
Carolina, he dreamed of a woman who reminded him of one to
whom he had once been engaged to marry. The relationship had
fallen apart when the woman moved to Massachusetts.
Once in the park Dave met a young park ranger, Charlotte
Hampton, with whom he felt strangely linked. She was working
in the National Park bookstore and was first cold, then flirtatious
with him. He says he found himself making some sort of strange,
intense energy connection through eye contact with her, which led
to a kind of blacking out on his part. Dave likened this to the way
a sorcerer or shaman "hooks" a person with his will, guaranteeing
that some sort of follow-up contact will occur. It turned out that
this woman was the one he had dreamed about" earlier, and that
she has had various psychic experiences that are apparently connected with Dave's own abduction-related experiences.
Dave and I met for his first hypnosis session on August 1 4,
1992, the morning after our first meeting. Julia was also present.
We decided to explore the abduction experience of the night of
July 8, which had occurred just after he wrote his first letter to
me. Before beginning the relaxation exercise, we reviewed what
he remembered consciously of the experience.
He had spent a frustrating evening at his parents' home twentyfive miles away, typing the letter on their word processor. He left
their house at about a quarter to one in the morning and arrived
home at about one-thirty. His wife was asleep in their queen-sized
bed and did not wake up when he got into bed at about two or
two-thirty. After he lay dowh, he said he heard a noise in the
house, "a creak or something," and thought to himself, "Oh,
they're going to come tonight." Shortly after going to sleep, "in
the context of a dream" (an ambiguous phrase Dave used several
times), he found himself "in our dining room. But it wasn't exactly like the dining room is in our house. The window was on a
different wall, and so forth." There was a large woman in the
room with him, and Dave felt "their presence." He was gripped
by a feeling "that I now realize is familiar to me, Jike when the
motorcycles came down the road and stuff." The vibration ''then
went from below my navel and out through my chest, and then it
was real tingly. It was a real tingly sensation."
The woman pulled him down to the floor, as if to hide from
someone, and Dave felt he still had some control, was able to
raise his head, and looked out through a picture window into the
woods. Then he said he saw a �emale being looking back at him
through the window. He remembered another abductee, his friend
Randy, saying to him, "It's the eyes. They hypnotize you with the
eyes ... I didn't think about what Randy said until my gaze shifted to the eyes, and it didn't make me not want to look at the eyes.
I was very curious, and I stared right at it." Dave could only see
the "upper right-hand comer of her head," which seemed enlarged. Some kind of screen appeared to be covering the parts of
the being's head that he could not see. "The skin looked very soft
and light gray." I asked what feeling looking at the eyes gave him.
"I immediately knew who it was," he replied. "It was this female
being who's mine, and I felt that I knew her very well, and that
I liked her very much, and that I was looking right at her."
At this point Dave said that he "blacked out, or lost consciousness, or something ... The next thing I knew I was laying in bed
on my side, all huddled up in a fetal position. I was huddled up
right up against my wife, real, real close to her and all curled up
into a little ball." Dave says he realized then "that wasn't a
dream." Caroline rolled over and put her arm over him. He had
a feeling "that there might be a being standing right behind me,
and I was afraid to turn around and look. After about a minute the
fear passed, and I propped myself up and looked at the alarm
clock, which was behind my wife on the bedside table, and it was
4:00 A.M." Dave's thoughts at this point were confusing. He "figured that I'd been abducted," but had the sense also that the large
woman in the dining room was "probably just my wife in bed
with me."
In the session, we began at Dave's parents' home, his frustration with typing the letter, and how "freaked out" he felt about
"reliving through typing and writing this letter all this stuff that
happened to me in the past few years." He felt rather "belligerent
about the whole thing," and as he lay in bed and heard a noise in
the house he thought, "Oh, they're going to come tonight." He
then became anxious as he told of turning on his right side toward
his wife and starting to fall asleep, whereupon he found himself
in a room the size of his dining room but with a long table unlike
the one in that room. Light from some source filled the room. He
again described the large woman (in a dark dress now) and the
big picture window (')ust a sheet of glass, whereas the windows
in our dining room open up") with the woods outside. Once
more, he said, he felt "their presence," the "sense that they' ve arrived ... It's like a total all-encompassing, very powerful feeling.
There's nothing you can do about it. When they' re there, they' rein control and there's no fighting it. I realize that I'm used to it.
I'm ready for it again, for some reason."
Once more the woman pulls him down, and Dave props himself
up and sees part of the face of the "visitor'' looking at him through
the window. The skin looks soft, leathery, and is light gray. "My
gaze shifts to the eyes, and I know it's her and I know she's looking at me." Her stare is ')ust totally there. The eyes look like
they're big, blac� kind of liquidy." An inner struggle ensued in the
session as Dave seemed to resist "what I'm supposed to do, what
they want me to do." I spoke to his need to keep in control as a
kind of strength. He likened the "trouble" or "danger'' he now felt
he was .confronting to the Chi experiences and altered reality he
sometimes discovered during his karate exercises. Even when, for
example, during kicking and other moves he blanks out and discovers he is "no longer in this reality" he must "go on like nothing
happened" and he cannot explain this to the other students for he
feels that they would not understand what was going on. "It's the
extreme strangeness of those experiences that I have to get used to.
It's my mind not wanting to lose its grip on what was always
pounded into what was reality, I guess."
This snuggle, and what he called "stubbornness," began to occur. 'This abnormal stuff' was "still too hard to accept, or some
part of me doesn't want to give up control [of] the idea of reality
that's been pounded into me." I took him back to the window, the
being's eyes, and when he "blacked out" while looking into them,
I asked him to describe the eyes themselves. "They're big, and
they're black, and they're slant� and they're real liquid looking"
and they're "pointed at �ch end ... I recognize the being. It's her.
I know who she is. It's like she's mine, and I'm hers. I feel this
is real. I really like her ... I feel that she has to be special, even
among them," and "I have the feeling from her that I'm special
and I'm not living up to it." Dave and I talked then of his shame
about wearing a "fake eye" and the pain of being teased about it.
The female being, whom he calls Velia, loves and accepts him
unconditionally, he said, even with his one eye and his smoking
marijuana sometimes, in contrast, for example, with a girlfriend
he had had when he was twenty who tended to be critical, formal,
and possessive. I asked Dave repeatedly to return to his center by
encouraging him to breathe deeply and focus on the breath. I assured him he need not feel ashamed that he could not maintain
control . Dave continued to struggle with the block he felt looking
into the being's eyes. "I look at her for a little bit, and then they
or she then increased the control, or then let it be total ... I won-
der where they're going to take me," he said, and I encouraged
him to let go. "I think there's more than one," he said. Weeping
now, with a mixture of fear and relief, Dave said, "We're out of
the house now. There's a mess of them, but I can't see them. I
don't know where we are. I think we're gonna go to a ship, and
it's out in the clearing I made five years ago." Dave explained that
even before he built his house he made a large clearing about 1 50
feet from it, perhaps unconsciously inviting a UFO to land there.
Dave described the ship as "big and round. It's about sixty feet
in diameter. I think it has a dome on top." Surrendering control
now, Dave spoke of being taken into the craft through the bottom.
His fear mounted in the session as he told of being forced onto a
table on his back in a round, gray room in which there is an
"earthylike" smell. Several beings gathered around "to do something to me." Dave said he was paralyzed now, able to move only
his eyes, as he experienced some sort of "stern encouragement,"
communicated telepathically by the beings, regarding a mission
that he was to fulfill.
The female being was there, he said, "helping me out," but "I
think this male guy's running the show." The female communicated telepathically that "it's going to be all right," which reduced
Dave's anxiety greatly. "I guess they stick something up my ass,
and I guess that's upsetting me," Dave said. "I feel they put my
legs up in the air and spread them apart." At this point in the session I sensed Dave's shame and embarrassment as a man in being
subjected to such a humiliating procedure and spoke with him
about forces in the universe over which we have no control, the
potential empowerment in acknowledging powerlessness, and the
inapplicability of conventional notions of masculinity in this context. He spoke then of a flexible instrument, perhaps four feet
long, with "a little wire cage" on the end, inside of which was a
small, spherical object. About "half' of this was inserted in his
anus, as the female being continued to reassure him.
Dave expressed his feelings of violation and resignation as the
procedure continued, as well as ''tingling" sensations. "It swarms
inside of me. It goes into more parts than just being up inside my
anus," Dave said. I encouraged him to express his anguish and
rage about what he had experienced, which he was able to do
only to a limited extent. Some of his outrage seemed to be related
to similar experiences going back to age twelve and perhaps to
age three. After about two minutes, the instrument was removed.
Dave believes that this procedure was some sort of "informational
test" to "keep track of how you're doing physically, how you'reholding up, what condition your body is in, if it's deteriorating, or
if you're in good health or bad health."
Next Dave felt a sharp object was stuck by a different, tall being against the left side of his head near the center of his temple,
which, surprisingly, hurt only "a little." The female being, who
was "to my right" continued to tell him "I'm doing all right. It's
okay. She looks at me and reacts to how I react." He felt a "total
trust in this being." Next Dave described a suction-type device at
the end of a tube being placed over his penis, which he found difficult to speak about but not as humiliating '4aS the thing being
stuck up my anus ... They made me ejaculate," he said, which
was "pleasurable as any ejaculation to any male being. It's just
that the circumstances are distracting, distracting from any pleasure that you may derive from it." Finally, Dave believes that
"they put something in my stomach," a '4circular sensory device"
about eight inches in diameter, for "checking something in there
... It made a little bit of vibration. It wasn't unpleasant," he said.
This completed "the physical examination," Dave said, but
"then she talks to me for a while or communicates with me," for
example, "that I'm doing okay." This "exchange" occurred while
Dave sat on the edge of the table with his arms at his side and
"my legs dangling down." He said there was also communication
about some sort of mission of Dave's to the effect that "we all
don't have unlimited time on Earth. We're here for a limited time,
and we have to make the most of it, and that would explain why
since then I've felt this tremendous sense of mortality. I'm not going to be here forever." The female being supported the fact that
Master Joe was Dave's guide, and "I know that I've just got to
keep doing what Master Joe wants me to do."
Dave explained that after the above procedures and communication were completed "they then support me somehow off the table
and down out of the ship." The beings "levitate me or something"
and accompanied Dave down the path to his house and through the
closed and locked door, and he was aware of 4'a glow back there"
from the ship in the clearing. He said the beings floated him up the
stairs, through the door of his bedroom, and "set me down" in the
bed near his wife, who was still sleeping. He crawled closer to her
and "curled up" as the beings left through the sloped roof wall at
the side of the bedroom. Because of "what had just happened" to
him "I just wanted to be comforted," Dave said. "I wanted to be
real close to her when I woke up."
After the session we reviewed what Dave had gone through. "It
was hell," he admitted. When I noted that he wanted to skirt by
difficult places rather quickly he asked astutely, "Do you think I
could stand going through anything else?" He felt "a little washed
out emotionally, drained" but amazed at how much he had been
able to relive. "It wasn't like I was really there, but I was remembering being there," he said. The UFO, he says he now remembered, had hovered about ten or twelve feet above the clearing,
and he was now convinced that "I made a place for them to come
down." About two weeks after this abduction, Caroline told Dave
that a week after his experience she had seen what might have
been an alien face in the bedroom and thought to herself, "Oh,
that's where they came in, or that's where they come in."
Julia, offering support, spoke to Dave of the brief -depression
that sometimes followed her hypnosis sessions, but said this
"would clear and you move on ... It's not all roses," she said,
"and yet, for me, it felt good to remember stuff. It's freeing. It's
wonderful." She said that she was struck by the fact that she too
had had periods of communicating with the beings sitting on the
edge of the table with her legs dangling and her feet swinging. It
seemed too frivolous somehow, "after they' ve done this," an "incongruent detail" that "didn't fit." Julia also described a flexible
hoselike instrument with a "cage" at the end (see drawings,
p. 257). Then Dave made plans to drive back to Pennsylvania,
pointing out that he did not like to drive after dark. "Oncoming
headlights bother my eye," he said. "I can't take bright lights."
Dave returned safely, and I talked with him on the telephone
the next day. He said that he felt "empowered" by his work in
Boston and talked of his experiences with his friend Jerry and
with Caroline, who was somewhat troubled by what Dave had
learned. He had surrendered some of his defensiveness and the experiences seemed "more real" to him. 1\vo days later he talked
with Julia, seemed cheerfut had developed "a fresh outlook on
life," and was trying to deal with a "deluge" of questions from
friends. She advised him not to reveal the details of his hypnosis
sessions. He said he was planning to clean out the clearing behind
his house. Ten days after this, Julia called Dave to find out how
he was doing. He had been feeling slightly depressed after his
Boston experience, but also because he wanted to do healing
work, and keeping "dying people alive" · through health care did
not "seem right" to him. He said he did not fear the aliens and
that cleaning out the clearing behind the house was "to give them
a nice place to land."
On September 9, Dave wrote Julia a letter which was the first
of a series of communications that continued through the fall andwinter documenting his abduction experiences, seemingly meaningful coincidences, and other significant experiences that were
happening to his brothers and the people in his community. In a
long handwritten letter to me he provided many details of the abduction experiences of coworkers and friends and wrote, "I know
at least 15 abductees in this area, including my 3 brothers�" Giving terminal care to people with whom he could not communicate
had become more difficult and he had cut down his hours at work.
He felt that his job in life concerned Chi, but it was difficult for
him to accept "big responsibilities." He was a blue belt in karate
now, "halfway to black belt." In October he told me in a telephone conversation that his wife had seen an alien being at the
end of her bed.
In another long letter in January 1993 Dave documented in
more detail synchronicities that we had discussed on the telephone. He enclosed pictures of a rare, partly albino deer with
black coloration on the back of its ears and tail (called a "piebald") that he had shot in December. He said, "if I would have
seen how beautiful it was I don't think I would have killed it."
When he took the hide to a taxidermist he said he had never seen
anything like it. When Dave c alled Charlotte Hampton several
days later, she said she had also seen a piebald deer in a herd of
them that were "running around the place where she works." She
said that the piebald was the only one that did not run off when
she approached them.
In this letter he also wrote of planning to meet Charlotte
Hampton at Gettysburg and believes this desire may be related to
a "past life" and "feelings I got several years ago that maybe I
had been in the Civil War." Regarding his belief that he was abducted between two-thirty and three in the morning on the night
of December 1 8/19 he wrote, "I 'came to' with a tremendous feeling of peace. I felt this was because you hypnotized me and I' ve
resolved the issue within myself."
At the beginning of February, Dave told Julia that "six beings
appeared in the bedroom to Caroline" at about one in the morning
while he was out of the house mailing the above letter to me. She
woke sitting up \;¥ith her arms crossed tightly on her chest and
found the beings around her bed. According to Julia's notes of the
conversation, four of them "departed through the wall behind
Dave's dresser (in the direction of the clearing). Two others went
behind the nightstand." According to Dave, Caroline was angry
about this and it took her nearly twenty-four hours to tell him
about it. Dave also sai.d he was planning to begin hypnosis lessons
to help other abductees.
In March, Dave came to Boston again for further hypnosis sessions. He wished particularly to explore childhood abduction experiences that seemed connected with Pemsit Mountain. The two
sessions, which took place on March 11 and 1 2, were attended by
Julia and also by Kishwar Shirali, an Indian clinical psychologist
who has a deep interest in transpersonal phenomena and considerable knowledge of Hindu mythology.
At the beginning of the first session we reviewed the experiences, documented above, which Dave had undergone since his
visit in August, and talked of the feelings of awe and wonder that
people experience when such synchronisitic patterns or designs
seem to unfold in their lives. Dave talked of what he was learning .
about Chi and its relationship to human spiritual evolution,
superstrings, the primal sources of energy in the universe, the role
of eagles in spiritual emanations, the capacity of babies to perceive other realities, and the openings that dreams give us to
them. He said he was learning to open his Chi and control it
through his hands, which he can make become hot. Dr. Shirali
spoke of similar processes with which she is familiar in yoga and
Buddhist n1editation. Dave said he had talked with Master Joe
about the possibility that the alien beings have mastered the capacity to communicate telepathically using something like Chi and
may be especially interested in people who have changed their energy regulation or "assemblage point."
When I asked Dave what he wished to do in the regression he
replied, "I want to find out about Pemsit Mountain" and "apparently it's all tied up with the Chi, and I feel the Chi is all tied up
with the experience for some reason." "The one that haunts me
most is when the three motorcycles came down the street at me
when I was three years old." All of Dave's early experiences with
"the visitors," he noted, occurred on the mountain, whose spiritual
power and meaning to the Native Americans of the region he
stressed once again. Many people who have lived where the mountain dominates their horizon also believe that it is a "UFO base."
At the beginning of the session Dave's thoughts went to Sober's Hollow, a place he used to go fishing with Rob (whose
death and UFO experiences we had spoken of in August) and another friend whose son was also killed in an automobile accident.
This friend is an abductee and Dave says he had seen his son in
an abduction experience two days after the boy had been killed,
before Dave had heard about his death. Then Dave began to cryand described watching his little beagle, Spotty, being hit by a
truck and killed as he stood on the porch of his childhood home.
He expressed fear of "being with them ... I walk out across the
porch up onto the street. It's up about four steps. Right around the
telephone pole. Here comes the three motorcycles whizzing over
the top of the hill. They'd be about a hundred yards away, and
they zoom towards me."
Dave again felt the struggle over control gripping him in the
stomach. As he wondered what was so terrifying, the (now two)
motorcycles with three black riders "turn into the beings." He explained that they "floated" him behind a bush on Shaeffer's (a
neighbor up the hill) lawn and laid him down on the grass. The
beings were tall and "skinny" with big black eyes that slanted upwards. He was paralyzed and terrified, as one of the beings, a female, was pressing something sharp against his head while she
was "working something into my hair" with her hand as the other
two, both male, stood above him watching. He was wearing only
a shirt, and believes that they must have taken off the shorts he
had started out with. Some sort of mind-to-mind communication
seemed to dampen his fear. The female being also laid her hands
on the lower part of Dave's abdomen, "checking me out."
Dave was crying in the session as he recalled the female being
"saying there's something important about it." The tears were of
relief, as "I guess I've always had it locked in there and it always
bothered me as to what happened." A year or two later when he
had asked his father about the motorcycles he had said, "You
must have had a dream," but "I knew it wasn't a dream." The female being told him that "she missed me" since "I' ve been here,"
,.e., from the time of his birth. "I was sent here to do something,"
Dave said. Fear kept coming to Dave "in slight waves" as he
spoke further about how he and the female being had missed each
other, her "promise" to "take me up on the mountain," and his
awareness that "there's more to us than what we know about
here." She also told him that he would have a "hard time with my
fellow man, but I'll come out for it better in the end" and explained that he was "living there on that mountain because they
have a special place up there ... I'll grow to love the mountain,
she said," and assured him that "I' ll find out all about them [the
aliens] sometime."
Then they were "done" with him and became motorcyclists
again, disappearing up a steep path, upon which Dave feels they
could not possibly have traveled, that ended abruptly at Dave's
friend's house. He says he looked for them, but there was nothing
there. The female being had told Dave that "it would be hard for
us to be apart, but they had some work to do with mankind and
I could be an important part of that, help that out, so we had to
be apart." He cried with grief as he said this, and I asked about
the familiarity of the female being to him, even at age three. He
said, "I guess I've always known," meaning "before this lifetime
or something."
At this point in the session we were faced with a choice which
I put to Dave, to pick up on "before this lifetime" or explore other
experiences associated with the mountain. "I wanna go to the
mountain," he said. The "end of the mountain" where "the rock
layers that make up the mountain are exposed" is "a big power
spot," he said. "That's why they go there ... I think they go there
for energy." Dave then felt a tingling energy which seemed to radiate from below his navel through the rest of his body and even
outside of it, similar to what he had felt in association with his experiences at both age three and twelve.
Dave described how he would go to the end of the mountain
when he was twelve. "I think the Indians used to go there. I'm a
modern-day Indian." Then "all these memories want to come up."
He was "back on the end of the mountain," above Spangler's Hollow, on a trail "above Matt's barn ... All of a sudden I went to
lying beneath the tree," Dave said, as he felt the tingling through
his body. Several beings, he said, "come floating up around the
bend" of a trail that was not ordinarily there, created now on a
steep slope in the side of the mountain. His fear mounted in the
session as he described feeling "shocked and surprised" as he was
floated by the beings, feet first, along the trail. "It's only seventyfive yards where they start floating me until we go 'round the
bend and I see the ship." It was in a hollow, suspended in the air.
"It's amazing," he saicL even though "I ' ve been with them on
ships" before.
Although it was daytime, the ship, spherical in shape, appeared
to glow very brightly and Dave felt "fear and awe" at "just how
powerful they are." (He remembered his Sunday school teacher
telling him when he talked with her at age fourteen about his
UFO paper that she saw something that looked like the sun land
and take off several times from the end of the mountain.) Then
the beings floated him into the ship, through the bottom, and put
him on a table which was held up by "a light-colored pedestal
that just seems to rise out of the floor and it's all one piece." The
room he was in and the ceiling were very bright, and Dave saw
some sort of instrument panel off to the right. He was frightened,expecting some sort of "checkup." He saw about six beings, the
familiar female one, several small ones, and a male who was in
charge. The male being looked like the female, except that his
eyes appeared more round.
Then Dave seemed to relive the fear, paralysis, and helplessness
he had felt at the time. He believes he was thirteen, "in the midst
of puberty." The worst part of "the exam," he said, is when they
"stick something up my anus ... They did it before," he added,
"when I was twelve." Dave was determined to "focus" on remembering the experience. As the female was at his side reassuring him, one of the males spread his legs and "puts this thing, it's
a couple of feet long, sort of looks like a thing that they root out
sewer pipes with. It sort of has like a large end on it, sort of wiry
or something like a wire structure-type thing on the end of it."
They put it up "a lot farther than you could believe that it would
go up. It's to check me out," for "seeing how you're doing," Dave
added. He felt discomfort and humiliation but little pain and "like
a zoo animal." Fear and awe "overshadowed" any anger he felt.
"You can't do anything" for their power is "total." After moving
the tube aroun<;i "a little" for about two minutes it was removed,
and the beings indicated they were pleased with his healthy condition.
To a certain degree, Dave says, he participated in their satisfaction with the results of the checkup, for he felt "somewhat akin to
them" and "that I've known them ... I admire their power," he
said, and "feel like I'm as much or more part of them than human." I asked him about the "akin" and the "more," and he said
that "they' re more consistent to be around than humans ." He recalled the change to junior high school when he was teac;;ed about
his "fake eye" in addition to being singled out as "weird" for being in the honors program and smart. The female being told him
that he would "go through a hard time" over his eye, but that
"eventually, later in life, it wouldn't bother me." He was also told
that he had lost his eye to learn in this lifetime "how to live with
that, because I'd have to learn to live with a lot of other things ."
This involved a kind of warrior preparation, including his work
with Master Joe in learning to manage his Chi. Master Joe, he reiterated, believes the aliens are attracted to Dave because of the
strength of his Chi.
Dave wondered again if the aliens "have known us before, in
other lifetimes" and if he had known them. Perhaps "it's an ageslong kinship," he suggested. "Maybe they help recycle souls or
something, that they're not just concerned with our individual life-
times but all our lifetimes as they relate to the development of our
soul, the evolvement of the earth." Perhaps if he was born with "a
higher energy" it is his responsibility to become a teacher, to "take
advantage of it" and "to be an example to show man that there is
more to us than what meets the eye, that the spiritual part of us is
the most important part . . . if people would realize how important
our spiritual part is we wouldn't have all the problems that we
do ... Chi is only limited by imagination," Dave concluded.
We agreed to meet the next morning to explore further the
question that Dave raised at the end of the last session, whether
the aliens have "known us before, in our lifetimes." Julia and Dr.
Shirali were again present, but Pam Kasey could not be with us.
Before inducing an altered state, I encouraged Dave to let his associations go to the familiarity of the female being when he was
three and the feeling that they had missed each other.
The first thing that came to his mind after a long pause was that
he was a Native American boy, given the name Panther-by-theCreek, of the Susquehannock tribe living near Pemsit Mountain,
and he was studying to be a medicine man. This was in a time
"before the Indians knew about the White man," Dave said later.
The boy lived by the river, caught shad, and dried meat for the
winter. Eagles lived along the river in the cliffs. ''The eagle is real
special. The mountain's like a special place. Medicine men go up
there to get visions, do journeys." When he was ready, he too went
up the mountain to get visions, and it was there that he met Velia
(the familiar alien female), who was a "friend and protector." He
felt sad, for he missed being with her and also because something
was to cut his life short. He cried a little as he described the territorial wars. with the Iroquois and "a big fight around Hollowman's Island." He says he wore deerskin and carried a bow and
arrow and war club and was just starting out as a warrior.
The battle was confusing, with a lot of screaming, and he said
he was shot in the left side of the chest through the heart with an
arrow. "It burned, and then it numbed. It was just numb." He
coughed up blood, he said, which filled his mouth and he choked
on it. Then he blacked out and died. "The next thing I knew I was
away from my body." He said he saw his body lying on its back
below and also one of the Iroquois warriors bending over him and
cutting off his scalp. Then he felt himself "floating up in the air"
and "dissipating, spreading out all over like a fog of crystals ...
I just like went everywhere. I was spread out real thin. It was
peaceful. I. think somehow Velia was there after I left my body,
when I was dying," he said. I asked at what point he saw her. Hehad not actually seen her but just "felt her presence." After he
floated up in the air "I knew she was there," he replied. "I think
I knew her before," he added. "I think for the Indians it's easier
to die. It's more like a natural thing, just calming. Very calm.
Death is just part of life, so it wasn't real hard to accept, not as
hard as it is for us."
I asked Dave if he felt a connection with Velia after he experienced dying. He answered, "When I floated out of my body, before I dissipated, she told me that she'd be with me even when I
came back." Again feeling sadness he said, ''Then I was born
again in Vrrginia." I asked him about the sadness, as he was crying softly. "I think I lived some place there and I was real happy,"
but "I had to leave." I asked him to go there and tell me first how
he got from the "dissipated" state to the experience of being born
again in Vrrginia. "I just kind of gathered together again and
popped back out into the world." I asked him to explain how he
did that. "I had to go into a woman's womb," he said. The woman's name was Mary Peg, he said, and she had long, dark hair.
"My dad's name was John," whom he saw as a large man with
sandy-colored hair. They lived in a little cabin and had a small
farm from which they made their livelihood.
I asked how he went into her womb. "I just went into her one
night in the winter," he said, "everybody was asleep, and there
was a little bit of a fire left in the fireplace. I went into her womb.
I knew that's where I wanted to go. When I went in she became
pregnant. She was laying there sleeping and I went into her." I
stopped him at this point, observing that for a woman to get pregnant an egg must be fertilized. He explained that Mary and John
had intercourse that night and "the egg was fertilized after John
and her made love" and "when the egg was fertilized at that moment I went into her."
I
, let go the possible discrepancy of her being already asleep
when he "went in" and asked, "Then what?"
It was "dark and warm" inside Mary's womb, her labor was
short, and he remembers "great pressure" and coming out "headfirst." He was her first child, but later there was a little sister who
died. Dave cried as he remembered Mary's sadness. "I don't think
she lived very long." The sadness, he said, also concerned the
Civil War and his own death. "We lived there on the farm, and I
grew up. I was a big guy, and I think I had to go to war." He was
smart, good on horseback, and served as a scout or spy on the
Confederate side. He said he was captured by Union soldiers and
hung at nineteen. ..
Dave suggested that these past-life deaths in war were related
to the fact that he didn't have to go to Vietnam. "Some guys my
age went to Vietnam. I didn't have to go this time. I was frustrated in those lifetimes" as he didn't get to become an adult. "I
didn't get drafted," Dave wrote later to me in response to my
question. "They had started the draft lottery for your birthday to
determine who would be drafted first and in what order. My birthday was the 353rd date drawn and they never got that far. Besides, I would have gotten a deferment because of my eye."
I took him back to his relationship with Velia. ''They" do not
live forever either, he said, but Velia has been with him through
these three lifetimes. He said that he loves her. "She's always
there. She's real consistent." He believes his first encounter with
her occurred when he was the Native American boy. He says he
was perhaps fourteen, by a stream, when he saw her "floating up
the stream by a path." He was surprised to see her, "frozen with
fear," for "I didn't know who she was." I asked what she looked
like. "Like she always does," he replied. "She had gray skin, big
head, big black eyes, and said that I wouldn't really know about
her ... It was as though she was a spirit ... She checked me out
physically . . . I didn't have any choice. I just sort of laid down
[later he said that she ''floated me down"] on the ground." She
"talked to tpe a little bit. Then she left." After he "woke up on the
ground" he felt "happy that it happened-it was like being chosen."
He talked with a medicine man about the encounter with this
being, and "he called them guardians." The medicine man also
"described the characteristics that occur in the experience and that
happened to the chosen ones" and explained that the guardians "try
to make you more in contact with the spiritual part of yourself." I
asked how they do that. He replied, "Just through being around,
exposed to your inner being from their power." I asked if he could
describe anything else about the encounter along the stream. "Vella
said that if we were to lose the connection with the earth that that
would be bad for us." It was like "the connection with the earth is
part of our spiritual, part of the spiritual side of us ... being part
of the natural world, being part of the wholeness."
According to Dave, she told him (all of the communication was
telepathic) that some day he would learn about eagles. "The Indians felt the eagles were important spiritually, that they symbolize
something, part of the Great Spirit." She told him she "cares
about me and she'd always watch over me." After the encounter
with Velia, Dave saw a black panther and believes he received the
name Panther-by-the-Creek "because," he wrote me later, "a panther was seen by the creek the day I was born. So when I saw the
black panther by the creek after my experience, I took it as a good
omen. It was a synchronicity in that lifetime similar to the ones I
experience now."
I asked him if he wanted to say more about Velia, who seemed
to exist in some form whether or not he was embodied in one or
another "lifetime." This was difficult for Dave. "I don't think it's
the same when you're dead-like she's not corporeal if you want
to pursue her," meaning, I think, that even though she might exist
in some disembodied form it would be difficult to find her, even
after we (human beings) had died. Nevertheless, "she's alive all the
time" but the embodied form "is not as important a part of their
being. They're more, they're more spiritual ... They want us to
know," he added, "that it's not the material part of us that matters
that much, that that's where man's problems arise." I asked him to
say more about that. "When you're Indian and you're real close to
the earth, you're real spiritual," he saicL "and you get away from
that you're more material, and that's to your detriment."
We were coming to the end of the session, and Dave felt sad
as he described his closeness to the mountain as a teenager and
how he would try to imagine what it was like before the white
men came. "That's what started me out in this spiritual quest in
this lifetime, thinking about that all the time . . . I yearned for
those times when it was all big trees and everything was pure ...
That's why," he explained, after seeing the UFO at nineteen, he
began to read the Don Juan books. He was seeking Native American knowledge and admired how close the Indians were to the
earth.
After the session, Dave connected the fact that he never wanted
to leave home while his brothers were growing up, even though
he felt "I should be out on my own by now," to his own early
death in the two "past life" experiences we had explored. "I didn't
want to move away from my younger brothers, 'cause they were
boys, you know. I wanted to watch them grow up, really wanted
to watch them grow up." This "started being real important to me
when I was nineteen." At that time he would think, "they're all
going to be my age soon, and you change totally from when
you're fourteen to nineteen. I wanted to see each of my brothers
through that transition."
The day before the last session, Dave disclosed that he had
once had an image several years before of having once been a
cavalry spy who was caught during the Civil War. He also said
that Mary, his mother on the small Virginia farm, was Charlotte
Hampton, but "I was afraid to utter that." This led to a discussion
of the reality status of "past life" experiences. I suggested the possibility that consciousness is a "continuous fabric" and that potentially we could be identified with any obj ect in the cosmos,
depending on the evolutionary task at hand. Dr. Shirali spoke of
the Hindu understanding "of the whole divine thing that's also
within you. The Brahma, the whole, the part reflects the whole,
and the whole is reflected in the part ... There can't be a linear
time." Dave resonated to this by saying that only "some part" of
him had been with Velia before.
Julia, who had been exploring her own "past life" experiences,
was deeply moved during the session. She began to cry as new
details came to her from these experiences and she found herself
''corning up with my own answers." She observed that more than
one person "could potentially access the same life." She also had
brought in her drawings of an anal probe, which compared accurately with a picture that Dave had made independently, except
that hers was shown open and his was closed. ''The only reason
I saw this open," she said, "was because the doctor showed it to
me.''
Dave called this session "the capstone," which brought a lot together for him. I wondered about what potential connection there
might be between his boyishness and the adolescent deaths in his
"past life" experiences. "I'm thirty-nine, almost forty years old,
and I don't act like it," he said. "Now I understand why," he remarked, he is "a mannish boy." Age nineteen, he said at the end
of the meeting, was "always hardest." When first he, and then his
brothers , reached that age he was afraid they "wouldn't get
through it."
I spoke with Dave a few days after he returned to Pennsylvania. His experiences in the sessions had been profound and took
time to assimilate. He was feeling somewhat isolated and was
walking a lot, trying to "figure things out." His wife, he said,
"can't get too immersed," and Master Joe had been quite busy, although he affmned the validity of "past life" experiences in Buddhist teachings. In early April, Dave wrote me a letter which
reflected his further integration of the material that came out in
the sessions. "It makes everything in this lifetime make sense," he
said. "I' ll never look at Pemsit Mountai n the same now," he
wrote. "What it is about the end of the mountain is no longer such
a mystery."
Dave connected his relationship with Charlotte Hampton, whohe feels was his mother during the Civil War, and his experience
with her in this lifetime to "getting my Chi channels opened." On
March 25, he had dinner with her in Philadelphia and "we got
along so well it was uncanny."
Early in June we had a long telephone conversation. Dave was
feeling well and making progress in his work with Master Joe. He
had "found his hands" in a dream, which, he has been told, is an
important step in the mastery of his Chi, and enabled him to fly
in his dreams. More people were coming to him for guidance,
Dave said, including a seventeen-year-old excellent karate student
(referred to him by Master Joe) who has had abduction experiences since age five. A few days later Dave told Pam that a girl
spontaneously told him that "the beings have a place up on that
mountain," which "flipped him out." A book he was reading
about a woman who was becoming a shaman and had abduction
experiences was leading him to connect shamanism and abductions.
At the end of June, Dave wrote me another long letter, filled
with "strange coincidences" and new connections between the
people he knows in this life and in the earlier ones . Native American spirituality, shamanism, strange powers of nature, altered realities, Chi, karate, the mastery of dreams, UFO abduction
experiences, "past life" experiences, and a multiplicity of synchronicities are all part of a mysterious puzzle for Dave whose pieces,
according to Master Joe, he is learning to put together.
DISCUSSION
Dave's case illustrates particularly well that the abduction phenomenon cannot be considered in isolation. He feels that his abduction experiences are linked to a wide range of other natural
forces and energies with which he has had a connection . since
childhood. These include a deep reverence for nature and its mysteries, an intimate association with Native American values and
shamanism, a personal feeling for the spiritual significance of certain animals (especially eagles and deer), and a determinatipn to
master his "Chi," which he defines as the "force which pervades
the universe from which reality arises." As Dave has opened himself to the power of these and other natural phenomena and spiritual teachings, the world has become a place of wonder and awe
and the earth itself increasingly sacred. This opening has been associated for him with many seemingly meaningful "coincidences"
(synchronicities) which taken altogether suggest a panem of connections, a sense of design, in the cosmos that Dave inhabits.
Pemsit Mountain, close to where Dave grew up, is for him the
focus of Native American tradition and lore, a place of special
power, and also, for many local people, associated with UFOs
themselves. A vivid, quite spectacular UFO sighting he reported
to have occurred near the mountain when he was nineteen, witnessed independently by a friend and one of his brothers, and confinned in the local media, was a turning point in Dave's life. He
was determined after this experience, in which he believes he saw
the dark eyes of an alien being looking down . at him from within
the ship, to read everything he could find about the unknown in
order to learn about what was inside it. He even discovered Tibetan Buddhist writings that seemed to confrrm their knowledge
of UFOs.
Dave's abduction experiences contain the familiar traumatic intrusions, humiliating for a man, that many abductees have reported. These include being removed from his home against his
will, the taking of sperm samples, and frightening anal probes, reassuringly explained to him by the aliens as checkups, a kind of
health maintenance program. But as these have been explored in
the context of his accelerating personal evolution, Dave's terror
and rage have been mitigated by his sense of wonder and awe and
his · willingness to surrender control before the power of a process
he does not understand. In that context he has become increasingly aware of a strong, loving connection with a protective female being he calls Velia whom he feels he has known since age
three and, as we explored in his third session, possibly in previous
lifetimes.
Vella appears to be a principal agent in the evolution of Dave's
consciousness. Our investigations have uncovered information
that, according to Dave, she has imparted to him telepathically
about the danger to our survival and the fate of the earth, of our
loss of emotional and spiritual connection with nature. Through
Velia, Dave's identification with the Native American reverence
for nature has become linked with his contemporary role as a local leader in the reassertion of that connection. In that regard it is
interesting that in our last session he reported that the Native
American medicine men knew of the alien beings and also looked
upon them as "guardians" or protectors of nature.
Needless to say, none of this makes much sense in the framework of the Western ontological paradigm, which has no place for
unseen forces of nature, intelligences in the cosmos that guard our
destiny, beings that enter our world in physical form but are not
of it, "past lives," or even UFOs themselves. Yet there is little
about Dave's personality that could be used to explain his abduction experiences. He is a practical, down to earth home builder,
who is respected in his community and has held the same job for
fifteen years. There is nothing about him to suggest a tendency toward psychopathy, delusions, or a proneness to fantasy. He, like
many abductees, has intensely resisted accepting the reality of his
abduction experiences. In his ftrst hypnosis session he balked at
"this abnormal stuff," even though he had reported conscious
memories of alien encounters before that meeting. One could argue that Dave's readings have influenced his experiences, but the
process has been the other way around: he looks for information
in books after he has had an experience that he does not understand.
In Dave's case we are finally left with the question that so
many of the cases discussed in this book pose. How are we to regard consciousness itself as an instrument of knowing? There is a
smattering of physical evidence that corroborates his experiences-UFO sightings with multiple witnesses, an unexplained
crescent -shaped scar that appeared after one of his abductions, and
a pattern of events that are too extensively and complexly linked
to be attributable to chance alone. Yet the evidence for the existence of another world that is unseen and yet powerful in its influence depends in Dave's case largely on the reports of his
experiences, the affective appropriateness and intensity with which
he relates them, and the judgment of the investigator as to his sincerity and the genuineness of his communications. Of this last I
am quite convinced. Dave leaves us fmally with the choice of rejecting the entire body of his experience as the product of some
sort of mental aberration or collective influence, or of considering
the possibility that consciousness is a valid instrument of knowing
and that the view of reality provided by the empirical methods of
Western science has been too limited.
Dave's "past life" experiences deserve special comment, for
they provide an alternative explanation to certain aspects of hi�
life and personality that would otherwise be based entirely on his
biography in this lifetime. I discovered nothing in his family life
or personal history that could account for a certain adolescent
quality that seemed unusual in a man of thirty-nine. He did not
seem, for example, to possess dependent qualities that would help
us understand his reluctance to leave home before each of his
brothers reached the age of nineteen. Yet his violent adolescent
deaths in two previous lifetimes, relived with strong emotional
conviction in the third session, provide a possible explanation for
this anxiety and his own fear of becoming fully adult. One could
argue from a traditional point of view that his "past life" experiences were related to an overactive imagination in relation to Native American life and the Civil War. But the opposite is also
possible, i.e., that Dave's "past life" experiences, which continue
to permeate his consciousness, are an important source of his
imagination.
Dave's case richly illustrates one of the more interesting mysteries of the abduction phenomenon, the creation of staging, presumably by the alien beings or whatever intelligence might guide
them, of alternative physical realities (see also Catherine's and
Carlos's cases, chapters 7 and 14). His story abounds with rooms,
like the dining room in his first relaxation session, that are not
quite the actual rooms of his house, and landscapes with caves
and trails that are not there upon later searching. There is something rather frightening about this. For it confronts us with just
how arbitrary the physical reality within which we happen now to
find ourselves may be. All that is required for this to be abruptly
changed, so it seems, is the choice on the part of some other intelligence with a power greater than our own to do so. We have,
as the abduction phenomenon seems repeatedly to tell us, little
control over the reality that surrounds us.
Fmally, Dave's case is about power, the immense power or energy, both spiritual and physical, that resides in nature. Through
his study of karate and Chi, Dave is seeking to gain control of the
expressions of that energy within himself and to provide an example in his life of its constructive mastery. Perhaps this is the central teaching of his case. In his April 8 letter to me he wrote of
Pemsit Mountain as a "big power place. That's why the visitors
go there . . . Power," the letter continued, "is a mystery we will
never understand. We can only learn to handle it. Maybe that's
what mankind needs, to learn how to handle his power."

CHAPTER THIRTEEN. PETER's JOURNEY

Peter, a former hotel manager and a recent acupuncture school
graduate, was thirty-four when a fellow student who had heard me
lecture on abduction experiences at The Cambridge Hospital told
him about my talk. "I might have had that too," he thought to
himself and called me. This was January 1992, and we first met
on the twenty-third of the month.
Peter's case provides one of the most dramatic examples of the
way the nature of abduction experiences can be transformed in
conjunction with the evolution of the experiencer's consciousness.
His abduction experiences were initially intensely traumatic, as relived in our first relaxation, or hypnosis, sessions. Gradually these
experiences, together with our exploration of them, became a central element in a spiritual journey that has led Peter into perceiving other dimensions or realities beyond the manifest world. He is
one of the abductees I have worked with who has discovered a
dual human/alien identity. In his alien self, he has become aware
of having participated willingly in the reported alien-human hybrid breeding program, and his case raises questions about the ontological status of that process. Peter is also a leader among
abductees, having decided to "go public" with his experiences,
speaking at conferences and on television and radio programs in
order to play a role in educating the community. Between February 1992 and April I 993 we did seven hypnotic sessions.
Peter has also been afflicted by vivid, disturbing apocalyptic
images of the destruction of the earth, and we have explored
whether these are to be considered as literal prophecies or as metaphors or warnings of possible futures. Peter 's abduction experiences have represented a kind of "other" life of compelling power
and meaning for him. His wife, Jamy, has been a steadfast partner
throughout Peter 's personal journey; yet he has felt that it is inevitable that he assign priority to his abduction-related life. This has
created the kinds of strains in their maniage that occur under the
best of circumstances when one member of a couple is deeply involved with abduction experiences. Peter is also one of the few
abductees in my sample who has undergone an extensive battery
of psychological tests. The reason for selecting Peter for these
tests will be explained in the context of the referral.
Peter grew up in a Roman Catholic family in Allentown, a steel
town in eastern Pennsylvania. Hi s father developed a left-sided
paralysis, muscle weakness, and a limp due to poliomyelitis he
contracted at age two, but was able to work most of his life as an
office manager in an auto body repair shop. He was college educated and attended medical school for one year before dropping
out to support his family. His father was eighty and fully retired
when Peter contacted me. They write regularly to each other. Peter's mother, who was born and raised in England, worked as a
knitter in a knitting mill in addition to taking care of her family.
Peter told the psychologist Dr. Steven Shapse that he became
the class clown, was rowdy, and began dri nking and smoking
marijuana at an early age. He has two sisters, Linda and Corinne,
six years and three years older than he. Peter feels close to Linda
"without knowing why." Linda entered a convent to become a
nun when she was in the ninth grade and remained there through
high school. She reports having seen a UFO and believes what
Peter says about his abduction experiences, though she does not
say she has had them herself. Corinne has no such recollections.
Peter attended a combination of public and parochial schools
and graduated from Allentown High School in 1975. He earned a
Bachelor of Arts degree from Penn State in Vocation Industrial
Education, completing a six-year program in 1981 that enabled
him to become licensed as a professional cook and teacher of culinary arts. From 1982 to 1984 he worked in a new hotel on the
Big Island in Hawaii, where he met his wife, Jamy, who is three
years older than Peter. Jamy is a practitioner of Shiatsu, a Japanese deep-tissue massage technique, and, like Peter, works as a
healer and therapist. She has a master's degree in counseling psychology. They have a close, warm, and confiding relationship in
which they can talk through difficult matters fully.The couple has decided not to have children, at least for the
present time. Peter attributes this in pan to the fact that Jamy was
the oldest of seven children in an alcoholic family. "She had to
raise a lot of the children herself, and I don't think she really
wants that again." Peter would enjoy having children, he says, but
adds that possibly "there is some destiny for me, or there is some
predetermination in my life that is tied in with thi s alien thing,
something for me to do. It may preclude children." From 1986 to
1990 Peter and Jamy were managers of a twelve-room hotel and
a restaurant on a private island near St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin
Islands. In the spring of 1990 Peter came to Boston with Jamy to
attend the New England School of Acupuncture from which he
graduated in May 1993.
In our first interview Peter said that he has always known
"there's been guardian angels. I've always known there's been bei ngs ... I'm very spiritual, and I've always known that I could
commune with God." He said he has also always known "that
there were UFOs" and "extraterrestrials ... It's just been something in my mind from the time I was a little kid." In the context
of his sessions, Peter has had hints of encounters with the alien
beings in infancy, and in his sixth session he had images of himself as a child as young as four playing with hybrid children,
which continued until he was perhaps eight or nine. In our first
meeting Peter told of consciously remembering going to a storage
space at the end of a long hallway in his home and feeling afraid
of what was on the other side of a window, which he used to sit
by. He said that he also remembered the beings watching him play
with other children or "just observing me be a little kid." At the
beginning of the third session he retrieved i nformation about being happy to see the alien beings as a little boy, of feeling chosen
by them, and of floating "right through the window."
In the third session, Peter also relived an intensely traumatic abduction experience from age nineteen or twenty in which a sperm
sample was taken against his will. In the course of our work he
has also had recollections of visitations during the period that he
lived in Hawaii, where he and Jamy lived in an open, isolated pan
of the island. Peter reported seeing "something outside the window" of their home. At the time "I always used to think it was
an owl" which "used to call me and tell me it was 'time,· " but
now he believes "it wasn't an owl" but an alien being. "I always
fe' t a kind of communion with this owl."
The most powerful experience that Peter recalled consciously
before we met occurred in the Caribbean during the 1987-88 pe-
riod. During this time he remembers he would sometimes go to
sleep afraid and then be awakened by a touch or something "hitting me right at the base of my spine." In our first conversation
he recalled experiencing terror, rage, and a loss of control as light
filled the room and he felt a "presence" around his bed. "I remember my whole body vibrated and shook maybe for a second,
two seconds, three seconds."
On at least one occasion Peter reported seeing small, hooded
beings in the room and would shout angrily at them. He also remembered consciously that under their influence he would walk
outside on the patio and, "bathed in a light," he would be "lifted
up" to a "round ship" with "a dome on top" and flashing white,
red, and bluish lights "spinning around it" that was visible "above
the treetops outside the house." At the time, according to Jamy,
Peter described that "they had this laser beam, and it went right
through here [points to center of forehead], and it was so bright
that my eyes, you know, like it was hurting." While Peter was undergoing these experiences Jamy apparently would be "out cold."
After one of these experiences he remembers finding two small,
red lesions like healing pimples behind his ear that were distinct
from insect bites in the rapidity with which they healed and the
symmetry of their arrangement. Peter's terror in the conversation
grew to the point where he felt "stuck," unable to go further, and
we decided to explore his experiences in greater depth under hypnosis.
Two days after our first meeting, Peter told Pam that the only
reason he believed what he had told me "was real was because
there were emotions." He found that he was "distancing�' from
what he had told us and "wants to believe that it's his imagination." The first hypnosis session was scheduled for February 1 3.
Peter was apprehensive before the meeting and had had a difficult
time sleeping the previous few nights, especially because Jamy
had been away. In one of his dreams he communicated "with
these beings" about how "we have inner knowing and a knowledge and power that goes beyond intellect." He had "the feeling"
that the beings are afraid of "the power that we may possess."
Peter chose to explore an experience in the Caribbean, probably
in February or March 1988, which he said began with two beings
appearing by his bedside. He became anxious, "like I want to
strap on the seat belt," as his thoughts drifted back to that time.
I assured him that I would not leave him alone with his experience in a way that he would find unmanageable.
Under hypnosis Peter recapitulated the setting of his house and
the hotel restaurant where they'd eaten that night, what he had for
dinner, and going upstairs to bed feeling afraid "something was
going to happen." He said he remembered waking up as Jamy
slept, feeling that he wanted to cover himself (he slept naked at
the time). Despite feeling anxious and vulnerable, for some reason
Peter got out of bed and walked over to a couch on the other side
of the room and then saw "this little creature ... It's happening
again. It's happening again and again. I walk over and I'm humiliated. That's what I feel most. You're [the being] looking at me
and I'm naked." He also felt "out of control," "inferior," powerless, and enraged. "I'm paralyzed. I want to kill it, and I can't do
anything." He had no will, for "they shut me down."
Peter reported seeing two beings, the one "that controls my
feelings" being slightly taller than the other. The top of his head
came up to the level of Peter's chest. The beings were thin and
wo{e close-fitting bodysuits with hoods that seemed to be made of
something like Lycra or latex. His anger appeared to intensify Peter's lack of control. Compelled by a force that seemed to lift him,
Peter lay down on the couch. His fear was mounting now and I
encouraged him to concentrate on his breath and to relax. "I know
they' re going to hit me with thi s light, and after that, that's
when it gets bad ... The light hits me in the forehead, and that's
when I jump and after that things become peaceful ... It's the
moment where I lose consciousness, where I lose remembrance,
where I lose control, where I lose that l' m part of it."
The smaller being was holdi ng an instrument that looked like
"the flashlights policemen hold with a head on it and it's pulsing."
Yelling now, Peter cried out, "Now it's going to hit me. It's going
to hit me." The larger being "knows my consciousness. He knows
what I'm feeling. But he's detached" and "doesn't want me to
know what he's about." This being controlled the smaller "drone
... the little shit that does all his dirty work for him." The smaller
being lifted up the light, "holds it there and hits me in the head
with it." After that Peter said he felt cold, shaking and shivering
on the couch in terror as control of "my functions" was "shut
down." A shift occurred then-both at the time of the incident
and in the session-and he felt more peaceful. "My body feels
like it's cut off from my neck, from my head." Despite his nakedness, the fear and sense of humiliation were also gone.
Then "the little guy walks beside the couch. He does something
with that thing again, like waves it over me, under me. How can
he get it under me?" The light lifted Peter off the couch and he
"felt really light." With his arms held up as if by some force Peter
found himself moving toward the door. He looked over at Jamy,
who was still sleeping, "and I know she's going to be safe,"
which the beings reassure him about as well. He got a closer look
at one of the beings ("It's like now he's my buddy. Now I'm not
afraid") whose face seemed ugly and distorted. "I can only see
half his face. It's wrinkled. It's like one of those animated Disney
characters ... He's got this big eyebrow. It's like a really big eyebrow." The skin of the upper part of the face seemed thick, with
"lumps" and "like three ridges, three furrows. It's almost comical
looking." The eyes were not big, but very dark, "like blue and
black," and deeply set in the face, "like an animal's eye, like a
raccoon's eyes." The nose was pushed in "and then it widens."
Next Peter said he was floated through the dining and kitchen
area and out the door to the porch or deck, which was illuminated
by a soft, white light that revealed the trees in the background. As
he left the house Peter could see that the source of the light that
he was bathed in was a small spaceship. As he and the beings
were "floating up," Peter could only see white light as he looked
up, but was "aware of the island in the distance," of the ocean and
"all of the trees down there." When he looked down he saw the
tin roof of his house and wondered why he did not feel afraid, as
he is generally scared of heights. Now he was feeling that "this
is an adventure" and "really happy Jamy's okay." He passed first
into a smaller ship which then drifted up through "a hole in the
bottom" of a larger ship. Then he was aware of darkness, "like the
inside of a house," and the light was now below. All was quiet except for a kind of humming sound. Peter saw benches and uniforms or "jumpsuits, like the things speed skaters" wear ')ust
laying there and I think, 'Why aren't they hung up?' ... I almost
feel like I've been invited to their home."
Above a wraparound bench that seemed to be made of a hard,
molded plastic were little lockers or compartments. Peter walked
about, as if on a kind of tour, and felt "honored ... like I'm
someone special" as "they let me look around . . . I want to say
that there are other humans there, but I don't know." He looked
out the window from "like the control room." He could look
across to another island, and "it's beautiful, 'cause the moonlight
is shining on the bay and then there are the lights of other hotels.
I can see them clearly." Peter reported seeing "another being
that's got a control table or something," and he observed more of
the suits hanging on a bar. They flew higher and as he looked out
a window, the earth became "just a pinpoint now." Peter becameworried, and felt confused and lost. "Where am I? Where's Earth?
How am I ever going to get home?''
Peter was incredulous about what he was recalling and began to
question his experience. I encouraged him to "tell it straight" and
we would figure it out later. Curiously he said he no longer felt
naked during the experience, though he was wearing no clothes.
He walked through a kind of "French door," which slid part way
into the wall. Peter walked down two or three steps and found
himself in a sunken room where there were perhaps a hundred
men and women. "I don't see them as naked ... I see them as in
a flesh-tone outfit, this flesh-tone, one-piece suit." He had a feeling like "walking into a cocktail party, and you're not sure who
you're going to go up to talk to." The taller being he had seen
originally came over to Peter and telepathically communicated,
"these are all people from Earth. Yqu can get to know them. They
are all here for you," as they have all "had the same experiences
that I'm having." Peter felt he wanted to walk over to speak with
one of the men who was talking to a woman. The man acknowledged Peter but said, "Not yet. You have to go. Not yet."
"This is the part I don't like," Peter said. "I don't feel good
right now." He asked to go to the bathroom during our session,
and when he returned said, "I feel really scared, John." Again in
the experience, he turned to the right and went into another
room where one of the beings "was working some dials or something ... I feel like I'm going to cry," Peter said. "I feel like I'm
really afraid. I feel like a little kid. I feel like I'm going to get
abused or something. This is not nice. This is not fun." I encouraged Peter to breathe deeply again. "This room has a real sterile
feel to it, a medical, ominous feel to it." The floor was jet-black,
like obsidian, and there was a glass wall with human beings suspended, rather 'like in the movie Coma, with helmets on their
heads. "A couple of beings" monitored what was going on in a
"control panel" or along a wall. They wanted Peter to go up to
some steps, which he did, and then a "silver dome" or "helmet"
was brought down over his head as he stood by a table.
He did not want to do so, but Peter said he got onto the table,
which was "the most comfortable table I've ever been on in my
life. It's like it molds to my body ... It's the greatest examination
table ever made." The table was tilted to a forty-five-degree angle
as one of the beings began to issue commands to ·another. "I hate
this guy. I hate when he gives these commands, and I know it's
going to hurt me," Peter said, practically shouting. "I don't want
to tell you what happens now." He was able to explain, neverthe-
less, that his legs were held together and strapped down while a
female being communicated to him "that it's going to be okay"
and he was aware that "I'm just one of hundreds of thousands.
I'm not alone." Then he felt "like my life force is being sucked
out of the top of my head" and ''I don't know what's going on
anymore ... I want to stop," Peter said. "I just want to relax."
Meanwhile several beings were observing Peter, "watching to
see how I react." Then he was taken to another table, a "colcL icy
metal" one contoured to his body, "a great medical invention�" he
said, with mixed awe and irony. There was more measuring and
checking, including "endorphins" or •4something in your brain.''
Then, using tools that reminded Peter somewhat of a dentist's fiber optical instrument, the beings probed his groin, '"right here
where the bone comes in," going ''right through the skin.'' Although the instrument seemed to be passed deeply into his abdominal cavity, Peter curiously did not feel pain at this point. His
genital organs were '1ust off to the side," and evidently not involved on this occasion. "I'm amazed at some of the simple technological things that they' ve got that we haven't thought of yet."
Peter said rather sincerely.
The most humiliating and frightening part followed as "they' re
groping at my legs" and he felt them put a tube in his rectum to
take a stool sample. ''These guys don't know how to touch people
· : _ . like, get some bedside manner." The tube was passed deeper
into his rectum and Peter felt that they left '"an implant" or "an information chip" inside of him. ''Why do you have to do this to
me? ! !" Peter shouted. "I'm tracked now [almost crying], I can
never get away. That's how I feel. I'm stuck for life. I feel like a
tagged animal. I feel like they put something big up my anus, and
spread it and then stuck something else up through it and then
they left it. It's way up inside of me."
Feeling defeated and humiliated now, Peter said that ··what
pisses me off the most is that they told me they were going to do
this. They held it up for me and showed me." Now he felt ''like
I can't get away. I feel monitored. I feel like one of those polar
bears with a collar on." He suggested that this happens "every
time," and that the beings repeatedly remove or put back in this
and other implants. This abduction experience. Peter thought,
"was the one that indoctrinated me. This was the one that made
me one of theirs, one of their beings or one of their animals ...
I feel really alone now, and isolated and afraid," he added. "I feel
defeated." I argued as best I could that these were altogether un-derstandable feelings, but distinguished between them and actual
defeat.
As the session came to a close, we talked further of Peter's
feelings of humiliation and violation. Despite it, he feels that he
is somehow "a willing participant" in this process, "wi lling to
help these people make the bridge between their world and our
world." Furthermore, he believes "the other people, those other
hundred humans that were in that room, are willing participants in
this too." Although he felt violated a�d traumatized on "some
psychological level ," on "a complete other level I understand that
it hasn't harmed me." He likened the process to a woman who
goes through the pain of labor. "She accepts it, and she does it.
She's not mad at the labor; she's not mad at the baby. There are
fits of anger. There are fits of hatred, fits of all that stuff. But it's
accepted as part of the process of birth."
Peter was not able to say clearly at this time just what or who
was being served. Perhaps it was to "accept beings of another
planet" in order to raise our own consciousness. "It's about evolving to a higher consciousness," he suggested. Perhaps beyond the
feelings of violation, abductees may come "to a place of feeling
good about it." In a card to me, written four days after the session,
Peter expressed gratitude for "the wonderful opening experience"
and wrote that he felt "less scared" and understood "a little better
what these 'experiences' are for me."
A second regression was scheduled for March 1 9. Jamy accompanied Peter to the session. Four days before this, Peter had another abduction experience while staying at a friend Richard's
house in Connecticut. He had just completed an energy heali ng
workshop and was scheduled to return to B oston that day. Though
he was inside the house at the time of the experience, three
women colleagues who had also spent the night there reported
having a vivid sighting of the small UFO over the house while
taking a walk. One of the women, who I have interviewed and
who is herself probably an abductee, wrote down the same day
what she saw:
As we walked, not five minutes from the house, there came
an amazing sound behind us to the right from Richard's house
above the river-my thought was the dam [water coming
through a nearby dam]-this was not an airplane or helicopter,
and no engine I' ve ever heard. B ut it was very powerful and
accelerated down the river, and by us, at "warp speed" and disappeared. I saw a shape, rather like a crescent, some darkness
underneath, and maybe orangeness to it, zap by above me to
the right.
In other notes this woman wrote that she thought of the wings of
"a huge bird," rather than an engine, and of the excitement she
felt at the sighting. She felt certain that "Peter was in the ship,"
but when Pam asked her if she thought of looking in the house
she answered, "Peter wasn't there. To me Peter wasn't there. No
one was there," and she felt no desire or need to check! Peter had
recently "woken up" from his abduction experience and was intensely shocked when the women came into the house and told
him of their experience. Only upon driving back to Boston did Peter tellc the women of his history of abduction experiences. The
other two women were also impressed by the sighting. One of
them, according to Peter, was "moved to tears by the whole incident."
Before beginning the regression, we reviewed the details of the
sighting and Peter's decision not to go on the walk with the
women. The house was in a beautiful area, and Peter had planned
to go on the walk. He had slept poorly, was somewhat exhausted
from the workshop, "and then I just decided not to." The house
was cool, there was a fire going in the fireplace, and Peter sat by
it, covering himself with a blanket. He "prayed a little" and
quickly fell asleep at what he estimates was about 1 0: 1 5, as the
women left for the walk at exactly 1 0: 10 A.M. It was 1 1 :05 when
he "awoke," as Richard, the owner of the house, was walking
through the door.
In the four days before the session Peter had recovered several
conscious memories of the abduction experience. He said that he
had seen the alien beings beside him, remembered feeling "that
we had to hurry," and recalled details of the inside of the ship. He
felt waves of terror but wondered "why doesn't this hurt" when
one of the beings "was doing something to my eye and I can still
feel it ... My eye really ached the next day," he said later. "It's
amazing." The day before, he had told his therapist about the experience, and he had had Peter lie on the floor and express his ·
feelings in a bioenergetics exercise. This brought back details of
playing in the storage area in his home as a child and "a very
clear recollection of the ship over our backyard, over the roof of
our house, and that I used to go out there."
For the next twenty or thirty minutes we talked of the strains
that Peter's abduction experiences were placing on his and Jamy's
marriage. Jamy felt excluded from much of what Peter was goingthrough and expressed fears that he would leave her. Peter spoke
of how his abduction life "rocks the very foundation of my whole
belief system," and had so radically changed his life. Jamy spoke
of feeling ineffectual, "so nothing I can do can help." I spoke
about how difficult it is for spouses who are with someone who
has an all-consuming mission and tried to be supportive to Jamy
in what she was going through. Peter said that "there's a part of
me that wants to live as normal a life as I can and keep all this
in context," but appealed to Jamy to be aware of how much support he needed in the face of .what he was going through. There
was no clear resolution, except a commitment on both their parts
to stay connected and try to be sensitive to what each was
experiencing.
The session had been scheduled before the March 15 experience, but we decided to explore this incident further under hypnosis, as it was so much on Peter's mind. At the beginning of the
regression we reviewed in greater detail the events of the night
and morning leading up to the abduction experience, especially
his decision not to go on the walk. Peter had felt a compelling
need to be alone, but "I'm afraid to think, John, that I was communicated with," that "somehow they communicated with me to
stay." As he sat by the fire, he said he ')ust nodded out." It was
not clear to Peter whether he fell asleep or not, but he described
being awake but "in another state of consciousness-it's like a
small part of my brain becomes aware and that's what's alive," he
observed. "What happens is your body goes totally asleep and
then something clicks on in your brain that connects you with the
beings."
Then he heard sounds. "I can hear the vibration," he said. "I
know there's a ship behind me." Now he was paralyzed, conscious of "what's going on" but "not having any control of it."
With his eyes closed Peter felt "a presence . . . Then I look up.
There's a being standing on the other side of the couch, and I
know I have to go. I know I have to hurry." He got up, the door
was open, and "there's the little being in front of me. He's the
blue people. He's the blue man. He's blue. He's very dark." The
ship "looks like a sunset," and Peter reported being floated up
with one being "on my left and the big one's on my right," as his
arms hung down by his side. After he was inside the ship it
"moved really fast. We' re just going off. We' re flying, zoom."
Then Peter walked down a kind of ramp and sat in what looked
like a wheelchair. He was afraid at first, but then curiously relaxed
as a "retractable" arm, "like a dentist's chair arm," was "coming
at me," with the instrument entering above the inner comer of his
left eye. "It's going up inside. It's going up inside. They got it!
It's twisting around. It's twisting. And now it's coming out. That's
it, they're excited. They' re happy. They got what they wanted ...
I'm just a piece of meat to them," he said. "I hate them. I just
hate this. How can they fucking just do this? No regard for me.
I just hate this." He felt he wanted to get angry with the beings,
"but I can't."
What Peter felt they "got" was information. "There's a thing
inside of me that they put in to see what's going on and to track
your memory . . . that somehow records everything in the mind."
His notion was that there was "a little black chip" in his brain,
perhaps from a previous abduction experience, and that the flexible instrument, which looked metallic, long and thin, "retrieves
the object" (the chip). Then they have "a moveable panel" which
reads or deciphers the information. Peter had the sense that the beings were interested in what he learned at the workshop and
"want to see if I'm a worthy leader. It's my reactions to situations
they want to know that are recorded in my brain, that are recorded
on this thing of theirs."
At this point in the session the timbre of Peter's voice changed
to a kind of monotonous droning and he shifted to speaking from
the alien perspective. "We," he said, want to study the chemical
reactions of the brain, and how people will react in order to
"know when it is time to be present ... For as we measure the
impulses," the voice continued, "web will know at what level the
shock will come in, so we will be better able to control it so we
will be in tune with the [human] beings as they go through this
shock process, as they go through the unfolding of seeing us for
the first time." Returning to his normal voice, Peter said that the
beings are working with us, measuring what is in our brains so
they will be able to tell how we will react to their manifesting
before us.
I returned Peter to his feelings about the eye probe. He expressed further resentment, and then said that he felt he was "being primed for something." "This has been going on since I was
a little kid." I asked him about his leadership role, and he spoke
of a process occurring "throughout the world" whereby "common
knowledge" of the abduction process was developing and that he
was one of the people who would "stand up" and be "comfortable
with the possibility of alien beings coming to this planet." Human
beings "all over the globe" have had abduction experiences, Peter
said, and these individuals, especially certain leaders, will help re-duce the shock that would occur when the alien beings manifest
themselves on Earth. The monitoring that he described was "measuring to what degree consciousness can become avail able."
Memory of abduction experiences would open up, Peter said, at a
rate consistent with the shock that he and others could integrate of
knowing of the beings' existence. "They were excited" on this occasion, he said, because "I had reached a certain level."
Peter did not report the specifics of his return from the ship. He
said he was "put down" on the deck outside the house and then
"the tall one" walked him through the door. Peter sat down again
in the chair, put the blanket over him. "I looked at the being, and
he looked at me. I sat in the chair and just went to sleep, and the
next thing I know I wake up and look at my watch." After the regression we spoke of the channeling of the voice that had come
through during the session. He said that this had begun four years
ago in the Caribbean, and that it feels like an expansion of his
own energy which allows the "alien energy" to come through
him. This can occur, he said, when he can "surrender my mind,
surrender my ego." He (like other abductees who have this
capacity-see, for example, Eva and Jerry) does not altogether
trust the information he receives in this way, but does feel that
"it's coming from a higher consciousness, from the spiritual
plane." It was occurring in present time, he said. "It's live broadcasting."
As the session was drawing to a close, Peter spoke of the possibility that the recognition "that there's beings on other worlds,
and there are other life-forms" could help us look in a different
way at how we deal with one another on the earth. "A subtle
shift" on this planet was occurring, Peter said, which is bringing
about changes in how we think of who we are and the wa_y we
live. "By them showing up, it's going to make us appreciate what
we have." His own task, he said, was "to s�rrender to that divine
plan ... It's almost like I feel like the aliens are watching out for
me. They' ve got a plan for me," he said at the end. He did not
fear the changes that were occurring. Though in many ways this
process was taking over his life, Peter felt "it's also going to support me, somehow." His consciousness was "shaking," and "some
days it's terrifying, and other days it's sure and secure."
A third session was scheduled for April 2, two weeks later. Peter wished to confront his fear of the beings more directly and
hoped "to be able to consciously communicate with them or be in
their presence without being in such terror." This session turned
out to be one of the most dramatic I have witnessed. For the in-
vestigator it was the kind of experience that cannot help but convince him that something actual and important has happened to
the experiencer, whatever its source may prove to be. Before beginning the regression we reviewed Peter's life situation. He felt
supported by Jamy and felt some confidence in his emerging role
as a professional healer, but continued to feel quite isolated and
alone "because of the experiences that I'm having going through
all these regressions." Although Peter had in mind that we would
explore childhood abduction experiences or those that occurred in
Hawaii, we decided to let his "inner radar" choose where his unconscious would travel.
In the altered state Peter did in fact begin with a memory of a
visitation in Hawaii where, surrounded by light, two beings
floated him upwards. But quickly "another vision" replaced
this one. He was a child now, four perhaps, and "happy to see
them ... I love it," he said, as he was floated down the hallway,
then puzzled and excited " 'cause I can go right through the window." Again the scene changed ("so many memories, John"), and
he was an older child, "about eight maybe, and now I realize that
we' re not going to keep playing anymore. Now there's other
things to do. There's more work they want to do, more experimenting. They want to do something with me. Now they want to
put something in me. And they watch me. I've been chosen now.
I have to lead the other little kids playing, and I'm not sure what's
going to happen ... It's like I'm old now and can't play anymore.
I have to do something." .
Next Peter reported being "on the ship. There's a glass wall
where all the kids play, and on the other side of it is where they
watch us from. It's like a big playroom. And now I have to
leave." The beings brought him over to them. He noticed they
have long fingers. "The tall one, his fingers are touching my eyes,
opening my eyes and looking inside my eyes. They tell me not to
be afraid. They communicate with my mind."
Relaxed now, he was in "like a dentist's chair," where the same
machine, "the one I remembered last time," was used to probe inside his nose. "They drilled. They moved something. They put
something in my nose, [gesturing] it's way up in here. It feels like
there's something there." This reminded Peter of how he had refused to go to a hospital when he broke his nose in a car accident
at the time he was a freshman in college. "It just dawned on me
that this is why I didn't go." It was not only the association to the
fearful procedure, but also "I think I knew there was something in
my nose that I shouldn't go to the hospital."Again the material shifted. Peter was older, fear was mounting,
and he felt he was "avoiding something; it's really on the surface." He spoke of major changes that the beings have told him
are going to take place "on this planet." They have the ability to
see into the future, he said, and "wish to help us to avoid what is
about to transpire ... John, this is too weird for me," he said, as
more images of future possibilities flooded him. I encouraged Peter to breathe deeply and to permit whatever information came to
the surface to do so without judgment or interpretation. His fear
became more intense again, and I urged him to go back inside, let
his body sink deeper, relax, and name whatever was "wanting to
express itself," including the judgments themselves.
What followed was one of the most disturbing episodes that I
have encountered during a session. Peter screamed in terror and
rage as he reported an episode from about age nineteen in which
he was on a table, "just laying there," as a cup was placed over
his penis, ejaculation was forced, and sperm taken from him.
''They have control over my genitals, over me," he said. ''They' re
draining me. I'm relaxing. They're just happy. They got what they
wanted," he exclaimed bitterly. I asked if there were other times.
''They do it all the time," he said. "Every time they come they
take it. They take my sperm. They take my seeds. Then they just
let me go." Were these not the same beings who played with him
as a boy, I asked. "It's different," he said. ''They don't care as
much ... They don't want me. They j ust want my seed. They
want my essence." Crying and shaking now, Peter described how
cold the room was and the utter helplessness he had felt. "I want
to fight them," he said, but "I can't do anything. I can't fight it."
In order to reduce his feeling of humiliation and shame, I assured
him that indeed there was no way he could have fought this.
"All the cells in my body are vibrating," Peter said. "Everything is moving. Everything is vibrating." I asked where he was
now. "I'm lying flat. It's like I'm in suspended animation. I'm
suspended. I'm traveling." His mind had evidently taken him back
to the start of the abduction experience or an earlier one from the
same period. He spoke of the terror of being lifted up, paralyzed,
with the light around him. "I'm suspended! ! ! They' ve got me !!!"
he screamed, breathing heavily, describing now "more clearly"
being taken into the ship against his will and being able to move
only his head while he felt the intense vibration and shaking "inside my skin." If he had been free, Peter said, he would have
lashed out at the beings. He focused on "this little being off to my
left ... I'd rip his head off is what I'd do to it. ra klll it. I'd
struggle with every ounce of my being," he burst out angrily.
Peter continued to scream. venting his fury, as he spoke of being taken into a room with an "operating table \vith all the lights
on it" from which he could see another room '4off to my right
with glass and there's people in there suspended. They' re on tables, and they' ve got those things on their heads again1 those
metal dishes on their head ... and now I'm just suspended."
Calmer now and breathing more deeply, Peter told of being on a
table and subjected to a procedure similar to the one he described
in the firSt regression. An incision was made under his testicles on
the left, "they' re searching around in the cavity," and semen was
withdrawn from inside by an instrument like a huge needle or
tube. One of the beings stood over Peter and told him that "they
won't have to do it this way again if I relax." But whether they
took his semen by this surgical-like method again or no� they certainly '1ook my semen the other way'' (i.e. , by the suction cup
method) "a lot of other times" during Peter's youth.
After the procedure was over "they thank me. So now I' m just
laying on the table, resting ... They know it was painful," but
they tell Peter "it's okay" and "they want to work v.1th me to not
be so upset." He was becoming tired now and moaned softly as
he described a procedure in which there was .. rooting around"
under his arm and "I'm tagged or something ... There's a lot
more probing that they did," he said, including '"something going
down my trachea," but "I think I've had enough, John. I'd like to
cool it for today."
The remainder of the session was devoted to a discussion of the
impact of these experiences on Peter's consciousness . �luch of the
terror, he explain� he related to "expanding my consciousness"
to 'l:he point where I could accept the beings and accept what was
going on." The terror, he said, was to "stretch my reality." I found
this puzzling, as it had seemed to me that in his experiences he
certainly had accepted the reality of the beings. Peter responded
that "the path we [ abductees and perhaps others] are all on is to
bring this to consciousness where we can remember our experiences consciously without this deep hypnosis.'�
Peter tried again to tell me what he was getting at. 'The terror,"
he explain� "has more to do with having an experience that
goes beyond my accepted perception of reality than it does with
the physical experimentations or diagnostic, whatever they do to
me.'' Abductees tend to become stuc� he suggest� "at the point
of terror that is beyond our perception of reality.'' The physical as-
pect of the experience, Peter continued, is essential to the shifts of
consciousness involve_d. "You have to experience it in the physical
before you can accept it in the psychological," he said. "A person
holds the experience in their body. They have the physical sensation of the experiences actually happening, and then it becomes
part of the reality. Just accepting reality does not do it ... They
need us to expand our accepted reality for them to be able to
communicate with us, for them to be able to come here," Peter
added. "It's an evolution of consciousness."
Playing the devil's advocate I suggested that perhaps they just
wanted hi s sperm so they could go off and propagate on their
planet and it was only a "spiritual conceit" to think they were
concerned about our evolving consciousness. He objected strongly
to this. "There's no question about it. I know that they are helping
me, expanding my reality, and they want me to do that in order
for them to communicate with me ... They need my consciousness to expand. They need more of my brain to be awake," Peter
continued.
''For what purpose?" I asked.
"So they can interact with our planet. So they can interact with
our life force," he replied.
''Toward what end?" I asked.
"So they can (>revent our beings from becoming extinct," he
said.
Our interests and theirs seemed to come together as Peter spoke
of the beings' "vested interest" in our planet, and their unwillingness, "like an older person seeing a child who's about to make
grave mistakes," to "let the child hurt" himself. "We're heading
towards some . cataclysm," he said, "and they want to help us."
But "until abductees come to the surface and can accept it and
live with it, they can't do it." My last question involved the source
of the beings ' intention-was it their own or was there "some sort
of spiritual force that's behind everything." Peter's feeling was
that "they are acting through a greater power," but he did not
know what that might be. He has "the sense" that 'lhese are real,
physical beings that have mastered an awareness of time or space
or whatever. They can see what's going on. They can see what the
possibilities are, and they' re here to help us, it's almost like-steer
us, to prevent us from hurting ourselves !"
As the session drew toward its conclusion, Peter reiterated the
centrality of the physical aspect of the experience for expanding
our perception of reality. ''The body memory makes it real," he
said. ''There are two separate things going on." The semen taking
and tracking are distinct from the stretching of consciousness that
the terrifying physical experiences bring about, although both purposes "are intertwined." Peter said that the beings are like "God's
angels in a very roundabout way," like "messengers, or He's
working through them, j ust like He's working through you and me
and Pam . . . Pure form consciousness on the spiritual plane does
not have the experience of the physical," Peter observed. "So it
had to embody physicalness in order to have all the experiences
of the physical. It's like consciousness said, 'Well, what do I want
to learn today?' and it chose · the earth as a place to learn physical
things."
A fourth regression was scheduled for six weeks later, May 14.
The last session had helped Peter come to terms with his experiences, but at the same time left him feeling more alone and isolated. Yet "going through the depths of that real agony" had
brought him "to a place where I'm happy to be alive." He had accepted now that "this is real," not "my i magination anymore," and
at the same time "accepting that I'm not a freak." He felt more
"whole" and the experiences were a kind of "gift"-as he put it,
"it's given me a piece of myself." Acknowledging the uniqueness
of what he had been through allowed Peter to tolerate his isolation
and aloneness. Before, he said, he had ''felt isolated� and I felt disconnected from people. This work really brought that to focus."
Now, he said, "I feel singular in my existence, but I don't feel
lonely. I feel alone ... I feel connected to the whole but yet still
alone."
In that context the abduction experiences themselves were no
longer "so bad anymore," so "horrible and traumatic and mean
and cruel and all these things." I asked Peter to say more about
the nature of the connection he had mentioned. "It feels like I'm
part of a continuum," he said. "I'm part of a thread. I'm like a
bead on a thread of pearls or something. I'm one of the pearls, but
yet I'm connected to the whole process. I can be happy with my
aloneness . . . It used to be really important for me to be connected," he said. "Now I know I'm connected. Somehow I just
know it. It's just a deeper spot ... This work has accelerated my
whole process somehow." Once again we agreed to let Peter's
"inner radar" take him where he needed to go in the regression.
Once in the altered state Peter was afraid again. He said he was
in Hawaii, before living with Jamy, and four beings were around
his bed. His roommate was in another bedroom. He began to cry,
overcome once again with fear and rage as 'They're going to do
it again. They're going to do it again ! I'm so fucking sick ofdoing it again." He said he remembered being given a choice to
remember the experience or not, but "they're going to get me either way." It seemed like they had returned after a "great void of
time" and wanted to see "how I've grown, and who I am ... It's
like they want to see how the experiment worked out." Once
again he said he was in the ship where experiments were being
performed on many other human beings.
Panting now Peter remarked that there was "this leap I've got
to take." The beings "want me for who I am," he said. "They
want me for what I represent, what's inside of me." Putting his
hand on his heart he said, "It's here, it's here, and they want me
for here ... It feels like they' re grabbing something that's in
there. It's inside of me. It's like they want my love ... They want
me to like them. They want me to care about them." I observed
his fear and hate. Still panting, he said, "I' ve got to get beyond
that." The process had gone beyond the experiments, Peter said.
'They want me to understand them. They want me to understand
what they' re about. I'm starting to vibrate." I encouraged him to
let the vibrations come. 'They want me to understand," he said,
"that there's understanding here, truth. There's a meaning to this."
Despite these positive assertions, the experience became once
again di stressing for Peter. "I want this to stop," he yelled, as the
fear and intensity of vibration in his body increased. Letting out
bloodcurdling screams he said, "I don't want to lose it. I want to
just go off. I don't want to go into the depths." I tried to comfort
and reassure him, and had him recenter through focusing on his
breath. Then he spoke of feeling peaceful as he was floated by the
short beings out of his house in Hawaii to a "big ship." As they
lifted off, one of the male beings, who was "always with themhe's the one who cares about me-" assured Peter that he would
be okay. "I trust him," Peter said.
It was important for Peter to convey to me that despite his own
distress, the beings were "not here to hurt anybody." They have
been here a long time, he explained, and "know us really deeply ... They have this wisdom to tell us," he said. 'They can see
what's about to happen to us, and they' re just watching us." As he
was saying these things, Peter's mind was "flashing" on the pyramids of Egypt and the "faces of Mars." B ut once again Peter was
overcome with fear and rage as he described being taken to the
black-floored room and forced to lie down on a table. A being
with four "clawlike," long, bony fingers put his hand on Peter's
chest as he stared into his eyes. "Those eyes. Those eyes," Peter
said. Once again a tube was inserted near his testicles, with the
same outcome, though Peter: was calmer now and had "learned
that I don't have to be afraid." Then he walked out of the experiment room into a room with about twenty people, many of whom
were women and children.
What he relived now seems to be his return from the abduction
experience in the Caribbean reported in his first regression. He
went through a door of a larger ship into a smaller one which descended. Then the bottom of the small ship opened up and Peter
floated down to the deck of his home. He watched himself enter
the house and lie down on the couch inside. All this, he said, "has
to do with my maleness for some reason. It has to do with me.
They want me. They want my heart. They want what makes me
tick ... They work with you throughout your whole life," Peter
observed. 'They like open people," whatever their age, he said,
including old people. 'They want to figure out how to get us to
be open to them." They are trying "to figure out what makes one
person more open and less afraid than another, and they genuinely
care about us." The beings fear us, Peter said, because "they don't
have the, I want to call it the 'killer instinct' that we have, and the
ability to fight and kill each other. That's what they' re afraid
of . . . that is the most terrifying thing for them, our ability to
hate ... It's like my rage that I have at them for doing these experiments is so foreign to them. They can't understand it. They're
afraid of us."
Peter noted that "it's our perception of what's happening. None
of us have been really hurt." Some abductees say "they have scars
and psychological damage, and I want to say, 'Can't you see
you're confused' ... The beings that I 've worked with," Peter
said, "are here to find out how to communicate with us, and how
to find a common ground and openness." The ones that he feels
connected with, at least, begin with children and "nurture them,
and they work with them, and they study them to figure out how
it is they operate and what it is about them that makes them open
and loving and caring, and those are the qualities that the beings
want."
A lot of older people, he continued, have had abduction experiences as young children "and just don't remember." Then they
come back and study the same people when they are older to figure out the qualities of openness they have in common and what
can foster them. "They're trying to study a way into us. They're
aware of our anger and hatred and our ability to hurt them." They
have "evolved out of' knowing "how to fight ... It's almost
as if they're so open that they know we can hurt them more eas-ily ... They want our love and how it is we love and care and
have such compassion. They also are terrified of our anger and
our ability to hate and kill and all that stuff, and they're trying to
get the two apart." They are trying "genetically" to take "the
higher human qualities and separate them from the lower human
qualities and somehow, I want to say, reincorporate them into our
race ... The whole thing with the sperm and reproduction ... is
really trying to help us evolve to the higher qualities of humanness." They could not manifest more openly now on Earth, for we
might "choose to attack them." If we were to "react out of a military place, or an anger place, then everything would be lost. So
they' re very cautious. They can't come here."
I asked Peter how our loving or open qualities might serve the
beings. 'They are human too," he suggested, and in their own evolution have "followed the path of almost rational intellectualizing" and "lost much of their emotions, and they want to get that
back. And it's through our planet and through our race ... They
are humanoid," Peter said, and "We've evolved from the same
place," but "we've stayed in our emotions and our emotions have
ruled the planet ... How we react as a race comes from our emotions." In their evolution they "chose to react from intellect or
from mentality ... They' re willing to share their intellectual
growth with us if we can share our emotions with them." But at
the same time they are afraid of the destructive part of our emotions. "It could be a beautiful marriage almost," Peter observed.
My last question to Peter in this session had to do with the
quality of looking into the beings' eyes. The intense eye looking,
Peter said, relates to "a longing to connect." As the being "looks
at me ... there's a longing that it has to connect with me, with
us, and it's just like, I wish that you could understand us. I wish
you could feel what we feel." I asked what the beings long for
from us. "It's like a brotherhood that's been lost. It's like a friendship that's been lost, and we just don't understand." They long for
the love, compassion, and joy, "all the healing they see in the
planet, all the goodness that they see here ... that ability to connect human to human that they just have so little of." I asked if
he could see that in their eyes. "In the eyes there's a coldness,"
Peter replied. "There's a coldness and a pure blankness, but behind the eyes there's-! almost want to say there's another eye behind the eye. And the other eye behind the eye is, I want to say
it's sad and longing, and it's trying to comfort me, but at the same
time it wishes I could help it. It wants to connect with me. It really wants to connect with me. It's almost like it's looking at an
infant [sobbing now]. It's just, if you were only a little older and
a little wiser and we could have a relationship or something."
I asked Peter about the sadness he seemed to feel and his sobbing. He said that "the sadness is such that I'm weak and crippled
and I can't do it. I'm so afraid that I can't give them what they
really long for, and so my sobbing is like someone who couldn't
protect my loved ones ... It's almost like a mother and son," he
added. "It's like a mother who can't love, who can't really connect." We were coming close to the end of the session. "It's gone
beyond the experiences now," Peter said.
I noted that for many abductees "the resistance gathers around
acknowledging the eyes." He responded that "there's a real longing there in their eyes. It's almost like a love that doesn't know
how to come out. They have this tremendous compassion in their
eyes for us ... When you first look at the eye," Peter recalled,
"it's like mechanical and cold and nonhuman. It's cold and
noncaring, but as you stare at it, and as you look at it, and as I
allow myself to look at the eye, I can see deeper in the eye. It's
just like looking at a human. You see the eye, but after you keep
eye contact, then you see the person and that's what it is ... On
the other side of the eyeball is the being, the creature," he concluded. He reiterated their kinship, our brotherhood, their humanness. "I just have the sense that they' re just a little bit removed."
They "chose a different way to create ... They have emotions,"
Peter emphasized, but "not as highly developed as ours, or else
they had it and lost it and now that's what we have to offer, our
emotions ... They' re not really different from us," he concluded.
I had made the decision in May, even before this last regression, to ask a Ph.D. clinical psychologist colleague to administer
a battery of psychometric tests to Peter. Psychological testing is
time-consuming and expensive, and it is not practical to have all,
or even many, of the experiencers with whom I work, tested. I
chose to ask Dr. Steven Shapse of Harvard's McLean Hospital to
test Peter because I thought the results could have scientific value.
By this time I knew Peter well enough to be impressed that there
was no manifest or underlying psychopathology that could explain, or even shed much light, on the experiences that he was
having. Some of his abduction-related experiences, and the various adj ustments that he had to make in relation to them, were obviously stressful. But Peter was, nevertheless, a high functioning,
stable, and likable person who had excellent relationships with
other people.
My thought was that if this impression were affirmed by aqualified clinical psychologist, it could help to dispel the notion
that the reports of abductees are the product of some sort of psychiatric disturbance. For even if some abductees were to demonstrate significant psychopathology, the fact that some, or even one,
did not, would go a ways toward ruling out a psychiatric explanation of this phenomenon. By the time I asked Dr. Shapse to test
Peter, I was doubtful that a psychiatric explanation would be
forthcoming, as I had found none in any of the cases that I had
seen up to that time.
In May and early June, Dr. Shapse met with Peter twice and, in
addition to his clinical interview, administered the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), a standard intelligence test;
the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test (BVMG), which tests for organic brain dysfunction; and the Thematic Apperception Test
(TAT), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2),
and the Rorschach Inkblot Test (RIBT), projective tests which
reveal the nature of psychological functioning and structure.
Dr. Shapse found that Peter was "highly functioning, alert, focused, intelligent, well-spoken, and without visible anxiety." There
was· no organic neurological dysfunctioning. "Situational stress
was noted to be high, and his experience of this stress to be severe." Peter expressed sadness on the TAT and seemed to be "battling evil forces." Dr. Shapse concluded, "most significant is the
absence of psychopathology. No psychosis or major affective disorder is diagnosable ... Significant was a moderate level of sexual preoccupation. His particular profile suggests that he may
have been sexually abused ... It is felt that underlying psychological themes do not impact in a dysfunctional manner at present."
No psychiatric diagnosis was made. "Psychosocial Stressors"
were said to be moderate: "Recollection of unusual and disturbing
experiences." When I asked Dr. Shapse privately what in these
findings might be relevant to the abduction history he replied, "I
don't see anything that would account for it." The suggestion of
sexual abuse is interesting in the light of the traumatic procedures
Peter reported being imposed by the aliens. There is nothing in
Peter's history to suggest sexual abuse by human beings.
Beginning in June 1992, Peter began to take a leadership role
in the community of abduction experiencers, speaking publicly of
his experiences and appearing on television. On June 1 5, he participated in an abductee panel at the Abduction Study Conference
at MIT, organized by MIT physicist David Pritchard and me. In
his five- to ten-minute presentation Peter spoke of the details of
his traumatic experiences as he had learned about them in the re-
gressions and of how he had "gone from tremendously deep anger
and resentment to an understanding." He talked as he had earlier
of the beings ' intense interest in our "ability to feel, to have emotion, to have compassion and caring, and our deep spirituality,"
the "qualities that make us human and permeate through all races
on the planet." The virtually exclusive focus on the traumatic dimension in abduction experience investigation and treatment, he
said, was due to our inability "to integrate these experiences into
our conscious understanding of perceived reality because we have
not thought it possible." He told the audience of eighty or so investigators that he thought the aliens did not intend us harm and
their purpose was to "get us to the point where we can interact
with them consciously and not have it be so frightening for us."
On August 15, Peter was filmed in a conversation with me at
my home by producer David Cherniack for a Canadian Public
Broadcasting one-hour program on the abduction phenomenon
called "Sky Magic" in Cherniack's Man Alive series. In our discussion Peter spoke of the "animal instinctual" way he had reacted to his experiences, being taken to a place where you are so
"stretched that your mind would explode," the transformation of
the quality of the abduction experiences, the material about them
explored in the sessions, the shattering of what he had thought
was possible, how "hair-raising" he had found it was to "run ·
afoul of consensus reality," and other ground that we had traveled
over in our sessions. Most dramatic was a ten-minute segment
where an audio tape of the most traumatic part of the April 2 regression was played, and the camera focused on the fear, tears,
and quivering of Peter's face as he relived the horror of those moments. The program was broadcast in Canada in October and received favorable reviews. It has not been shown in the United
States.
In the next few months, with Peter's permi.ssion, I used that
video segment several times, including in a presentation to the
Department of Psychiatry at Harvard's. Brigham and Women's
Hospital, to enable audiences to experience the emotional power
of the abduction phenomenon. I stopped doing so when it became
apparent that many people, including abductees themselves, found
the video too disturbing and would sometimes erect new defenses
rather than becoming more open to the experience. When I
showed · it at a dinner meeting of the Skeptical Inquirers of New
England in November, several of the attendees became so distressed that they had to turn their backs to the screen and then
proceeded to concoct outlandish explanations for the abduction
phenomenon.
On December 2, Peter and I spoke at the Harvard Divinity
School on "The Alien Abduction Phenomenon" to an audience of
about 250 people. I gave an overview of the phenomenon and
showed the video segment. Then Peter talked of his experiences
for about ten or fifteen minutes, followed by an hour's discussion
with the audience. In preparation for the presentation we had
talked on the telephone a few days before. Peter spoke of how he
had felt "naked in front of God" in the utter terror and helplessness of his experiences, controlled and beyond choice, yet connected with something greater.
In his presentation itself he said that his "journey" had enabled
him to discover his "place in the universe." He had felt abandoned by God and reduced to "nothing more than a sperm sample." Yet after his regressions he had had "feelings of tremendous
expansiveness." In his total aloneness he had discovered his oneness with God and spirit. "The abduction experience," he said,
"allowed me to feel this aloneness yet to feel totally connected
with that one individual source." He spoke of the "likeness of
God" among peoples all over the earth who share a common humanity and "all struggle to understand the mysteries of the spirit
world and our connection with it."
Further, he went on, "I began to know on the most cellular
level that we are not alone in the universe, that God created many
creatures in llis likeness." The alien beings "are not so unlike ourselves. They too struggle. They too question existence. They too
are inquisitive. They nourish themselves. They procreate and they
pass on. They wish to be accepted for who they are ... God created a lot more in the universe than we can ever imagine," he
continued. "Like thousands of others like myself who have had
the experience, have seen God's creation in other forms, I know
in the deepest part of myself that the beings are like us in many
ways." Through his abduction experiences, Peter concluded, he
has discovered "that I am connected to a creation process that is
far greater than anything I have ever been asked to imagine in any
of my other previous exposures to any spirituality."
Between May and November 1992, Peter told Pam and me, he
had felt at peace, relatively comfortable with his abduction experiences, settled within himself and had ''worked out all the pieces"
with family and friends. But ten days after the Divinity School
presentation Peter wrote me that since late November he had
wished to "remember more" and "go deeper" and asked to do fur-
ther regressions. He wrote that he had also passed his national
acupuncture examinations. Our fifth hypnosis session was scheduled for January 14, 1993. At the begiruting of the meeting he
said he had "wrestled" with it for a time, but felt ready to "remember something bigger, something broader." As we planned
the focus of our work for the day Peter described a time in Hawaii
when "three people" whom he identified as 'just Holy rollers,
you know, selling Jehovah's Witnesses, or something" came to his
home. "I can still see this woman's face," he said, '1ust looking
at me like she knew something about me."
Peter connected this memory vaguely with an abduction experience that had occurred in late August on Nantucket Island. He
had been visiting a friend, Craig, who leads fire walks. During the
night Peter heard a noise that frightened him, saw lights, and had
visions in his mind of a being floating across the room to Craig's
bed and coming back to Peter and saying, " 'Okay, it's time to
go.' And we left and we came back." In the morning Craig said
that he too had heard a high-pitched noise that he chose to dismiss
as "crickets" but had been afraid to get up to go to the bathroom.
Before beginning the regression we reviewed what had been happening in Peter's life, especially Jamy's progress as a therapist and
their thinking about having children. Peter himse1f was feeling
more trusting, that "I'm being taken care of on some level" and
"the road is being cleared for me so I can do my work."
Again we agreed to use an open-ended approach, not focusing
on any one episode. Peter's first image was of looking out at night
from a condominium where he was living in Hawaii at "this huge
ship hovering over the golf course." At the same time three people, "like three Jesus freaks or something," walked into the door
of his living room. "I think they're talking to me about God and
about religion, and wanting to convert me or something ... It's
them !" Peter exclaimed. 'There's a connection between them and
the ship. It's like their human form. They' ve come again. They' ve
come again. I can't fight ' em. I can't fight ' em."
His attention shifted again to Nantucket. He described seeing a
being floating toward Craig's bed and became anxious for him,
but "then it's time to go ... I'm always cold when this happens,"
Peter said, but also fog came in the room, and though "it chills
me," it also "calms me down." Two beings have come for him, he
said, but it is "subtler now." A lot of the "formality is gone now,"
and it is "not necessary to be afraid." This is "like a training," an
"initiation into accepting what's really true." Nevertheless, Peter
sat on the bed shaking with fear. As if his "spirit" were up in the
comer of the room, he could look down on his body on the bed.
The beings waited for him and "they are not forcing me." He was
reassured that Craig will be safe.
Peter 's fear deepened now as he described being given a choice
of whether or not to accompany the beings, "to walk through this
wall, to walk through this second-floor ceiling." This choice
seemed to take on metaphoric power in the session, involving, in
Peter's words, the "freedom of going to the next level. It's the
next level of going with them." He spoke of a "great web" of
connection, a "consciousness of the whole . . . I am them, and
they are me and there's the ship!" His thoughts returned to the
woman at his door in Hawaii who "kept looking at me ... I
wasn't ready to accept God or Jesus or something ... What
frightens me," he said, "is that they took human form when they
came to me. They walked right up into my door . . . It frightens
me that anybody I could walk into on the street could be a
fucking alien or something."
Peter 's attention returned to Nantucket as he sat rocking on the
bed, crouched on his haunches with his knees up to his chest. The
choice of whether or not "to get up and dive" through the angled
wall or pitched roof of the house now represented passing through
to " 'another dimension' ... It's not the same as like physically
walking through a wall. It's like stepping into an energy field ...
They didn't carry me through that wall this time. I walked
through it ... I'm looking down, and I can see that I got up, I
took one step, two steps, third step I went into the field. One, two,
three," he whispered.
I asked, "What about the fourth step? Was there a fourth step?''
It is difficult to conve)L. what happened next in the session. Taking the "fourth step" took on great symbolic power. Meaning and
action, past and present� physical event and metaphor, seemed to
be condensed in this choice, which came to represent willing participation. As he sat on the edge of the bed, Peter felt he was facing "the terror of accepting, of accepting the responsibility." At
stake was "a step into evolution, leaving behind the animal." He
felt that by walking through the wall he could "transcend time and
space." He wanted ''to let out a battle cry" and "charge," to "go
with them." But he said the struggle continued for many more
minutes. "Nobody can help me," he said. "It's not even terror
anymore. It's a choice," but he was afraid that "if I make this step
there won't be anything there." Unlike in previous abduction experiences, the beings "aren't going to do anything ... There's
nothing but just this moment in time of me." I kept taking Peter
to the edge of what loomed as a lonely choice, but could do little
more than be with him.
The fourth step took on the meaning of a leap of faith. What if
he were to take it and "there's nothing there" he asked over and
over again. "What if there 's nothing on the other side of that
wall." This signified "failure" to Peter, that "all this is for nothing,
all that went before me is for nothing ... What if I can't make it!
What if I get stuck! What if I only go halfway ! What if I can't
go ! How can I trust you? ! How can I trust that I can go through
there?! What if there's nothing there?" Peter kept repeating these
and similar questions and I could only encourage him to go more
deeply into his doubt and fear. He screamed and moaned and his
body began to shake as he approached what increasingly became
an acute moment of existential choice. The moment lightened a
bit when he quipped, "I 'm scared of heights. What if I fall?"
Finally, he said, "I drifted right through this wall." But the moment lacked conviction and his consciousness returned to the bed.
"Okay, I'm gonna get up !" he said. "I 'm walking, I'm walking!
I'm not even running." He let out a loud hissing sound as the
process reached its climax. Peter 's doubt continued "I'm bouncing back and forth now," he said, as he kept returning to the bedroom to check whether he really went through the wall. "Did I go
through that wall?" he asked. "It just happened in a split secon<L"
he said. Eventually he felt "totally convinced and calm that I went
through," like "Peter Pan," and saw the pine trees below.
Outside now Peter looked down. "I realize that I'm floating,
and I see the ground. I see the side of the house ... I see the ship
above us," he said, "and I make my way towards it," and "next
I'm in the ship." Inside "all the babies are there, all the children
are there." He was standing in a room that was black, "like black
marble or something." Along a curving wall of a corridor that
seemed like the outer perimeter of the ship, there were little lights
at about hip level. He walked into a room where he saw three
chairs and a table and "another chair for me at the end ... Images
and images" were coming, but Peter's consciousness kept drifting
as he seemed to want to avoid what occurred next.
He said he saw three beings. One, directly in front of him, had
a "really big forehead" and seemed older than the other two. The
one on the left was an alien female. The third being was an alien
as well. These were the three who had visited him in Hawaii. Peter was "there to learn about the future," he said. His large forehead was knotted with a kind of split in the center. Peter said that
"he's the same one that oversaw all the operations ... I feel like
he's smarter, I mean he's definitely the boss." The female being
was to be his teacher. "She's going to be my guardian, or something. She's gonna watch for me. She's, there's something that's
going to transpire. Oh, my God."
"What?" I asked.
"That we' re gonna ... we' re gonna fuck." Fear, not desire,
filled Peter at this point. "I' m going to breed with her," he said.
"I'm getting that that's what this was all about," which was communicated to him mainly by the old one, whom Peter also called
"Mr. Know-it-all" and "Bubblehead."
"I didn't want to know this," he said. "It just kind of blew me
away."
Peter was shocked to be told that the babies he osaw upon entering the ship were his alien or hybrid babies and that he was
"breeding with aliens ... That's what my sperm has been doing,"
he said. Peter's fear grew again, as he considered the implications
of what he was discovering. He realized that he had repeatedly
made love with an alien female. "It feels like she's my real
wife-I want to say on a soul level. She's the person that I'm really connected to, and she's the one I'm going to be there with,
or be with, or something." This information was communicated to
Peter by "Bubblehead" and the alien woman herself, and he felt
its truth with great conviction. But as he spoke of this Peter experienced his "consciousness being separate from my physical body,
like up here, looking down at myself sitting at this table."
This was all becoming "too much" for Peter. "It's not even
about making love or sex," but "breeding with her," he said. "Oh,
God, John. My hunch is that this woman is a human also, and that
they've been taking her eggs and my semen and putting them together and breeding them up there." As Peter thought about what
he was saying he said, "I don't think I can put into words the
depth of how shocking, about how much I've been taken aback
by what I just saw ... The most frightening thought for me," he
said, "is that she may be an alien and I'm seeing her as a human,
and that I'm making love with an alien." I asked Peter what was
"so horrible" about the idea of breeding with an alien. "They
want me to like her as a human would like or love something,"
he replied, "like I would love making love with my wife ... It's
about my feeling of attachment to her and my love for her as an
alien," he continued. "What about my life on Earth, John? What
about my wife?"
Peter spoke, in addition, of a certain physical revulsion. "I can't
get beyond the fact that they are these horrible ugly creatures that
I've been terrified of with this slimy skin, like cold skin, that I'm
making love to ... I don't fucking believe I'm making love to an
alien." Peter talked further of his worry about becoming separated
from Earth and his "earthling family" and losing his connection
"with all that I love here." He became confused as he contemplated "how many children" he must have, considering how many
sperm samples had been taken from him.
Despite his distress at all this, Peter looked upon this process as
a project to which he had agreed. "The first step," he said, "is
simply the creation of children, the zygotes, the infants. The second step is the pairing of the parents," an Earth parent and an
alien parent. A bond "is created between these two so that they
can raise the children in a fashion of both Earth and alien." We
talked more of his shock at the idea of being an "alien father," although he recognized that the hybrid children needed "a mother
and a father ... With the advent of the destruction of the earth as
we know it," he said, these will be the children that will
"repopulate" the planet. They are like "poppy seeds ... pods" that
will be "scattered around the earth."
In the light of the strangeness of this information I asked Peter
about the level of conviction he was experiencing. "One hundred
percent truth," he said. "It's about learning. It's about the future,
those were the feelings. It wasn't just knowledge, but it was real,
it was feeling." We reviewed the staged conference, with the three
aliens on the three chairs-the old wise leader, the human/alien
female, and the "original alien" on the right. It was as if they
were reasserting his commitment to what he now experienced as
"an arranged marriage" with the female being. "It feels like two
people that are bonding for a purpose that's bigger than themselves," he said. "If I don't my race will die out ... It's gone beyond taking my sperm. Now it is about do you want to father? Do
you want to be a conscious participant in this breeding?" This decision might have been made "back ten lifetimes," he suggested.
Peter was convinced that his alien/human mate was the woman
that came to his home in Hawaii. She was rather plain, with auburn hair, "not homely, just kind of neutral in her appearance. Not
good-looking. Not bad-looking. I don't really remember her figure
that much." This led to a discussion of his struggle to live "in two
parallel worlds." In some respects his existence in the other world
has a stronger power for Peter. "I'm going more in depth into my
reality there," he said. "My biggest fear right now," he continued,
"is going home and telling Jamy: 'Well, how was your regression
today?' ; 'Well, I saw my alien wife and our kids. ' "
As the session was drawing to a close Peter talked about the
potentiality of his life's work and the complex responsibilities he
had taken on. He felt that taking the fourth step, "walking
through," represented a deepening of his commitment to the
breeding project, especially his fathering role, which included a
loving relationship with the female being "because the parenti-ng
process is something that comes from two people." It has to do
with "what comes energetically from the parents, from the feeli ngs, from the connection between parent, between husband and
wife, or between mates, and then was transferred to the child."
Peter stressed the importance of the parenting process for the hybrid children after the beings have "raised embryos" on the ships,
or in whatever domain they are growing.
This had been a powerful session, and at the end I reviewed
what had occurred and raised questions about the literal and metaphoric aspects of all that Peter had gone through. For Peter it felt
as though his struggle was concerned, above all, with an evolutionary step, and that "accepting and choosing, consciously choosing, to walk through the wall," represented his commitment to that
step.
A few days after the regression Peter told Pam that he had gone
over with Jamy what we had uncovered in the session and she
was "perfectly fine" with it and supportive. He felt relaxed, trusting, and "strong enough" to "go deeper." The regressions, he said�
had had the effect of cutting his "ego down to size." Then, in the
place of terror and anger, he could find "space" for the connection
with the alien beings and the "breeding program."
A sixth session was scheduled for February 1 1, four weeks
later. Honey Black Kay, a therapist who was learning about the
abduction phenomenon, was present during the session. At the beginning Peter reviewed for Ms. Kay what had occurred in the last
session and Jamy's acceptance of his process. It had been difficult
for him to accept "the depth of it," while at the same time he
noted a certain "absurdity" in what he had discovered. "I' ve gone
from a victim role to a participant role," he said, and talked about
the importance for .that shift of overcoming his fear of stepping
through the wall in Nantucket during the January 14 regression.
He approached this session with a mixture of eagerness and anxiety about what he might discover.
In the altered state Peter returned first to being on a table "back
when they used to take my semen," then to when the three alien/
humans had visited him in Hawaii, and back to the experience in
Nantucket in August that we had explored in the last session.
Once again he experienced the emotions related to his decision to
"go through the wall" and what that had meant for him. Once
more he felt the vibrations in his body as he sat on the edge of
the bed and the surrender of control that going through the wall
had represented. In addition to the breeding program, he also had
experienced a certain "loss of my identity" in the discovery that
he was, in a sense, "part alien." In the session now, he felt that
"I'm starting to vibrate on that cellular level."
Peter let out a long, loud scream followed by rapid shallow
breathing as he discovered himself once again on a table, beside
which was his female alien/human partner who said to him something like, "You're going to know later" and "this part isn't so important." He felt his mind opening up now and experienced the
"freedom of choice to go to any memory I want to go to." Once
again Peter experienced walking down the corridor to the room
with the three beings. They told him that "since I was a young
child I had agreed to do this, and I chose to come here [to Earth],
and then they first came to me, and I chose to play with the babies, the other beings, the aliens." The other aliens "watched me
interact with them, and because I didn't show any fear, any problem when I played with them, they asked me if I wanted to continue." He said that he had agreed as a four-year-old child to
continue to play with the hybrid children, .. which he spoke of as
"more of an interaction with me just sitting there with them and
there's a communication."
I asked Peter to describe the hybrid children. "They had big
heads, and, like, wisps of hair, and they have bigger heads than
bodies," he said. "They have -skin that's kind of like our skin. It's
a little rougher-more fleshy. It's not like baby fat. It's like oldage fat, and the arms are really fragile, but they have big bellies.
They're funny. They're cute. They look like little babies."
When the three beings visited Peter in Hawaii, he explained,
they had asked him again "if I wanted to continue." Although
he was not "ready to remember'' at that time, "there's always
been a choice I've made to go forward." A new choice seemed
to be developing now, "something else," Peter said, as he reexperienced being led down a hallway where "they're gonna
show me things." As he walked down the hallway, Peter was
shown pictures on either side. He saw nuclear explosions, sections
of Europe and the United States destroyed, "a lot of people
burned, a lot of people upset . . . the human race changing" its
"form" and "texture." Peter and the woman and the thousands of
babies they had produced together were "part of that change," of
the "repopulation of the earth." I asked Peter why this
repopulation was necessary. "Because of the destruction of the
earth, because of what's happening, what's going to happen."
I asked Peter to say more about that. He said that there was "a
battle going on" over who was going to "get control of the earth"
between "beings from all over the universe," not only "the beings
I' m associated wi th." This "has been going on" for perhaps two
thousand years, he said, but was now "all coming to a head" It
was not quite the same as "good and bad," Peter explained, but
rather "different possibilities of going forward." The "whole reproduction process" in which he was participating was playing
"an integral part" in this unfolding. Peter spoke of prophecy, "revelations," and people being "taken up" as in the Biblical raptures.
But to him this had "nothing to do with religion," for there were
"ships in place for that to happen." He said he has looked into
"this black void" of the future and seen the earth below "with
people going up ... It's not so much seeing it as knowing it," he
said. At the same time he felt the "loss of everybody I've ever
known, and every connection I've ever had to Earth."
Peter objected to the word rapture, preferring to ·speak "of the
beings coming to help us to the next place of evolution ... The
slate is going to be wiped clean," he said. "It's a new millennium
of the earth" that is "supporting a whole other world." He had experienced a "bargaining going on" with "greater forces actUally
negotiating the future of the planet," its "next two thousand
years." As he lay on a bed, Peter reported seeing before him naked human beings, standing or "suspended in animation." He began to comment on his perceptions with words like "weird" and
"bizarre" and I asked him to put aside judgments and commentary
for the time being and just report his "raw" experience. Then the
year, he thought, might be 201 0, and once again Peter saw "people coming up" during a period of time when "a lot of shit happens on the earth" and the ships make trips "back down."
Peter's role in all this is to "make the babies" with the alien/
human female with whom he has been connected, to bring the
whole process "into consciousness," and to work with the female
in "taking care of the kids." He would become a leader of "a new,
original tribe," a "new race of humans." Although Peter said he
had accepted the repopulation plan, he found all this quite disturbing, especially "the destruction of the populations of the earth,"
which will happen "in a blink of the eye." Though nothing could
be done to prevent all this, Peter said, on the positive side this
evolutionary process could create "a second chance" for human-
J9nd. The hybrid tribe, he said, would come down like "sections
of people" to be placed in various areas of the earth, basically an
advanced "transplanted population" with knowledge "from another world," prepared to start "new life . . . A whole system"
would be transplanted.
I asked him about the fate of us ."original" humans. A lot of
humans would be left, he said, but plagues, pestilence, and "all
this stuff' would destroy the "infrastructure of the civilization of
man as it is today." The entire society would crumble. I wondered
what I or we were supposed to do with this distressing information. Peter replied that it was "no coincidence" that I had been active in the antinuclear movement, which i mplied the possibility of
some sort of preventive efforts. But he said we were seeing the
future "on the horizon," the situation was hopeless and he felt
"like watching the ship sink and you're on the lifeboat."
Peter felt heavyhearted about all this but resigned at the same
time. Despite the fixed nature of his vision, which to him felt totally real, he said that "on some level there is negotiation going
on about the future" which was "about all these different possibilities for the earth ... If there is consciousness in the universe we
have a stake in wherever we are," he observed vaguely, and "if
the world comes to an end as we know it and another, another human consciousness, inhabits the earth then we' ve progressed." After all, he noted, the alien-human interbreeding was "interbreeding
within our own species on some level."
The session ended here. Peter, seeing our glum moods, said, "I
feel like I ruined everybody's party." He reiterated, nevertheless,
how powerful his feelings had been and real his "story" had
seemed. The remainder of our discussion concerned the reality
status of Peter's prophecy. He resisted some the notion of "probable realities" and of our power to choose a different future. For
in this regression he had gotten the strong sense that "we're not
the only consciousness that has a say in our future." By surrendering control "to the greater forces" Peter said that he felt "much
freer" and "more comfortable."
In a telephone conversation with Pam three weeks after the regression Peter said that he was upset afterwards for a while, especially because he felt so isolated with his information about the
"earth ending." Nobody wants to know about that, he said, but he
continued to experience the evolutionary process he had seen in
the regression, with aliens and hybrids coming down to Earth, as
"very real." Peter continued to experience intense new healing energies which he related to his connection with the alien beings,and found he was able to transmit this energy helpfully to other
· people. He asked her if we could schedule another regression.
We met for the seventh session on April 22. Peter began by
telling of a session with his therapist in which he had lain on the
floor in a fetal position, hugged a pillow, cried and rocked, and
experienced himself as an alien being or consciousness that had
entered a human body. He wondered, "Who am I?" and felt he
was "losing myself to some degree ... I am an individual soul
that just came into this lifetime" and entered "Peter's body." In
other lifetimes, past and future, he would be "something else," but
"I was always Peter. I'm always this soul ... My soul is actually
alien ... I'm not sure what that actually means," he said, whether
he was "created by them or them coming into this body." If that
were the case, "then I feel lost, like, who am I? Am I just a vehicle for their use? Am I just a machine now? How much of this
is my free will? It puts a whole other twist on it."
Peter then described in great detail the change he had touched
upon with Pam concerning the development of his healing energies. This came about in a class at the Barbara Brennan school
when the teacher, seeing something in his auric field, touched the
side of his head and he felt "something just explode inside my
head." He experienced intense vibratory changes in his body that
the teacher and others in the class perceived as powerful pulsations in his energy field. After returning to Bosto� Peter found
that for two nights his whole body was "vibrating and shaking."
One night he said he awoke hearing· a guidance that "you' re supposed to transmit energy of a certain vibration for people. That's
what I'm supposed to be doing." Peter had mixed feelings about
thi s. Although to a certain degree he accepted and had some effectiveness in using his enhanced healing powers, he did not
"have any real desire to stand up and say I'm transmitting energy
from aliens."
Peter's intention for this session was to "open up to a deeper
knowledge." He had "come to grips on the physical level" with
the abduction phenomenon. He wished now to work "on more of
a soul level." Although he felt he was "on the edge of a deeper
understanding," Peter was also "afraid to find out what I'm going
to learn."
In the regression his first images were of alien beings in his
room, of children, and of feeling like a baby or fetus, which he
found disturbing. He felt next that his own body was "exactly as
if I'm in an alien body. My head feels big. My neck is real thin.
My body is thin. My fingers are long. My body is low. I have a
real thin waist. Everything is long and skinny, and I feel like I'm
standing there talking to this other alien." He felt he was "one of
them," and that the conversation occurred before he came to
Earth. But "future past" was "all the same," and he was "looking
at the past and the future at the same time." Peter knew he could
transcend his body, "receive information and work with them. I
am them ... It feels like I came here [to the earth] for a reason,"
he said.
The conversation was with his alien mate whom he said he had
known for "eons." They were saying good-bye, for this was "the
last time we're going to see each other in this form ... I don't
want to leave her. I don't want to leave," he said. "I 'm starting to
be afraid now. It's all new." But he had to leave, for he had "chosen to do this to help her, to help all of us." The helping project
was to impregnate his alien female partner "with my sperm as a
human, as a male, as an Earth person." Then he was "laying on
the table and they're taking my sperm. But now she's standing
there. She's looking in my eyes and she's comforting me." There
is also "something that they want to alter-my molecular structure or something," Peter said.
At this point in the session Peter felt mounting fear and
screamed and moaned loudly as he struggled with his "willingness to look at" whatever was to come next. A cold feeling came
over him and he experienced a "fine vibration" in his body. Images began to come of vast Earth changes that were to occur before the year 2002 as he lay on a table with "two aliens off to the
side who were talking to me" while other beings were "working
with other people in Europe and Africa and in the East." "But,"
Peter added ambiguously, "we are the aliens who have come here.
We're the ones that have come here." Then he felt he was "down
in the ocean" is great shifts occurred in the continental shelf and
a great tidal wave engulfed much of the East Coast and the Gulf
of Mexico swept across the South.
I asked Peter questions about the source of this information, in
what capacity he felt he was gaining it, and what his role in the
process might be. He said that the information had come through
the alien beings, that his job was to prepare for the future by
changing the "energetic structure" or vibrations of people with
whom he would work, and as an alien in human form ' to mate
with his female alien/human partner to produce a hybrid race. He
explained that '�when I'm taken back to the ships, as they're
called, and the semen or the eggs are removed from us, us beingthe human physical body, then they can be used and mixed with
our reproductive system."
I observed that from what many abductees had reported, the hybrid beings seemed rather listless or lacking in life and wondered
how they might function in a repopulating process. He said that
thi s was, in effect, a false perception based on a human perspective and the limit of what we could accept. "They are simply lifeless in your terms_ ... They' re really us, the aliens, and we' re not
lifeless. We're only lifeless in your eyes ... We are formless. We
are not like you," Peter continued. "I'm seeing this as a human
and as an alien at the same time. It is important for you to see us
as we truly are, which you would interpret as lifeless because it
is not human." I was not able to see their "spirit" or "being," he
said. Somehow I was not satisfied with this and wondered how it
was that we could not. Peter's answer was confusing to me, referring to my biases in what I interpreted as life, "the embodiment
of soul, of God. It is just you are seeing a different species of
man, that is all."
I commented upon how "needing of nurture" the hybrid beings
seemed to be. What "better way" could there be, Peter said, to get
human beings to "accept us [he was speaking now in the first person as an alien] than to show them us in our most needy form ...
The goodness in their heart," is the "common theme of all humans," he observed. 'The heartbreak is the memory that they too
are us, and that they' re connecting with their species so to say."
Human abductees, Peter explained, have an alien identity as well,
so that when they connect with the alien children they_ have created "there is a conflict between remembering their connection
with their species of origin [presumably alien in this context] plus
their human connection with that baby, that child, that infant." I
noted how devastating this is for the abductees, and he agreed that
it was "cruel , in your eyes." He too felt "split in two," and his
"human part is just resisting the alien part, the part that knows,
the part that has so much information to bring here."
Peter said that lines were being drawn, spokes or tunnels
through which people would pass into the future. There will be a
"shift in time," and it will be like "a veil that people are going to
walk through ... The species of man will continue," Peter said,
but in a different form. "The earth is going to open up to a place
of interaction with other beings," including the hybrid children
"now being created." Once the humans who are "part of this
plan" move through time and "through the shift of consciousness,
there will be no anger or hatred or resentment" among abductees
who are "shown their children ... That which you feel is cruel,"
he continued, "is just the human mind trying to understand." I
was not altogether convinced by this, but it seemed time to
move on.
Peter returned to the theme of human evolution and became
"scared" again as he developed a kind of scenario of salvation.
"Not all of us can go forward in the new being," he said. There
would be a sort of "straining of those individuals that won't fit
into the next place." The change would be quite beautiful, as consciousness opened "to a much finer and higher vibration." His
fear related to leaving behind "what I know," but "the higher part
of me knows that all of those beings, all of those humans that die
actually transcend." The "next step," Peter said, was "the process
of getting these people ready to move through the veil when it's
time." He saw three forms that would interact without veils between any of the groups: humans embodied as we are now, a mixture of humans and aliens, and the aliens themselves.
Peter's vision was of a kind of "Golden Age of learning and
openness and opportunity." Peter himself mentioned again that
deep inside "almost my soul is the alien," and in his embodied
form his task has been to use his reproductive systems to create
an intermediary species and to "somehow change the vibrations of
other humans that are here when the changes happen." People his
age, he said, were the "first generation" in this process. "Our [hybrid] children are the second generation ... The scary part," Peter
said, was "the radical shift in my waking consciousness" involved
in "actually embracing the work," embracing the "conscious
awareness of who I am, at least in this incarnation." He sensed the
"vastness" of all this and felt that this information probably was
changing me also in some fundamental way, making me think
"beyond just this clinical paradigm of 'what is the experience.' "
He thought we might be on the "same edge ... You're one of
us," he said. "You' re one of them."
Peter found this session particularly difficult and was quite
withdrawn for several days afterwards. He found particularly troubling the vivid sense of himself as an alien, which seemed
"crazy" to him, and wondered if other abductees perceived themselves in this way. Pam shared some information with him about
others we had been working with who had similar dual-identity
experiences. He asked to meet with me to try to integrate the information that he had opened to in the last session.
We met on May 19, and Peter shared the "oceans of doubt, despair, and questioning" he had gone through after the last session.
We wondered together on what plane of reality to view what he
had reported. He said that he viewed me as a kind of "midwife,"
and that after each session he had come to a place of resolution,
of "transformation." He was more convinced than ever that
"there's a power out there greater than me, or greater than us, and
they have some control over my destiny and over the planet's destiny ... The Western mind, the social-economic structure that I
grew up in, doesn't hold for me," he said. "I'm a different man
than I was prior to my regressions," he said. He is now "trusting
in the universe . . . waiting for a greater call, waiting for something to shift."
"I'm connecting to the beings," he said, "and I have a sense
that they're connected with God, whatever that God is ... As intermediaries," he said, "they are doing the same thing that we
would do if we came across a species of anything that was on the
brink of extinction." We would try "to help them without direct
intervention." The beings were "acting with God," he suggested,
to breed for the "highest qualities of mankind." At the same time,
he said, they seemed to have "been able to transcend time and
space and see what the possible future evolution of the planet is,"
using "the mythology of UFOs" to have us "realize we're part of
something greater." Peter felt forced to turn inward, and was planning, he said, a ten-day vision quest, a solo camping trip in Montana at the end of July, to explore more deeply the questions that
had come up for him this spring.
The remainder of the session was devoted to the practical implications of the changes that had occurred. He continued to feel
isolated and alone with his experiences. Though his transformational process had had a certain inexorable quality about it, he
feared losing his connection with Jamy, and the "nice secure role
in society" that he would have as an "educated young man" and
a "professional" acupuncturist. He was still seeking the support of
his father and sister, but had received no response from them after
he sent videotapes of his talks and after they had seen him speak
emotionally of his experiences on television. He and I, Peter said,
"and other people in this group [of experiencers and investigators]
are being pulled away from the safety of our normal world into
something else, and that's what's troubling." Nevertheless, he
said, he was committed to continue his work in bringing about
"subtle vibrational change in our energy fields."

DISCUSSION
Peter's case takes us to the edge of the mystery of consciousness,
the evolution of human identity, and the apparent purpose of the
abduction phenomenon itself. His regressions seem to contain a
progression, changing from more "standard" traumatic intrusions
to complex spiritual experiences involving the opening or expansion of his consciousness an9 visions of possible human futures.
Memories of more purely physical events, especially of one-sided
invasive actions by the alien beings, are largely replaced by communications between Peter and the beings that seem to be part of
a complex, reciprocal learning enterprise.
Interestingly, seeds of the next regression seem to have been
planted in each preceding one, although the selective processes at
work on the part of Peter and the investigator may be operating
here. As is probably always the case in this kind of work, the directions of the case's progression depend on the mutual opening
and learning of both the abductee and the investigator. This is not
a linear phenomenon, like "leading" a witness or client. It is a
rich, partly unconscious, interactive or intersubjective emerging,
creative in its unfolding and flawed in the limitations of its objectivity.
There is a curious problem inherent in the notion that the sessions reflect some sort of progression. For most of the abduction
experiences-the examination of the Nantucket experience of August 1992 in the fifth session is a clear exception--occurred before Peter and I met. Therefore if there is an evolvi ng of
consciousness evident in the sessions, it means (1) Peter is perceiving differently experiences that have already occurred; (2) his
psyche is bringing into consciousness those elements of the abduction experience that will serve the current moment of his evolution; or (3) a more _ outlandish thought-his changed
consciousness is actually altering the nature of the past experiences themselves. Since we do not know in what reality these
events have occurred in the first place, it is difficult to choose
among these, or perhaps other, possibilities.
There is a problem of tense in the reporting of the sessions that
should be noted. Peter and I are talking presumably about events
that have occurred in the past. He, however, like most abductees,
is reliving these experiences so vividly in the current moment that
he speaks in the present tense most of the time. If I adhere strictly
to the past tense in my contributions to the narrative, I may be introducing a distorting voice. For Peter 's reenactment, his "live"communication in the present, may be a more accurate depiction
of the place of the abduction experience as, simultaneously, both
a real and a psychic event (again, this division may not hold
strictly) than my rigorous sticking to a past tense narrative form.
The first session focused upon an experience in 1988 in the
Caribbean in which Peter, and apparently many other human beings he saw on the ship, were subjected to humiliating anal probing and the implanting of some sort of object which he believed
was a tracking device. Even in this first session, Peter had the
sense that he was in some way a willing participant in this process, however traumatic these experiences had been. The second
session and the events surrounding the sighting in Connecticut
were particularly shocking to Peter's belief system, for there apparently were independent witnesses of his UFO abduction experience. The apparent probing of his brain, though emotionally
traumatic, also was connected with Peter's leadership role, a testing of his capacity to be an intermediary between Earth and the
alien realm, should the beings choose to manifest themselves
more directly.
The third session, involving a dramatic and highly disturbing
narrative of the forced taking of a sperm sample, explored the relationship between bodily experience and consciousness evolution.
Peter seemed to need to experience in his body, with all of the accompanying terror, the full impact of what had happened to him.
Only then was he able to acknowledge the power of his experiences and thus become able to accept what he would subsequently
learn through further personal investigations. In the fourth session
we began to explore the mutual longing for connection between
the aliens and humans, a relationship of unrequited love, felt most
acutely in the contacts through the eyes. The reported hybrid
breeding process appeared to be selecting out human loving and
caring qualities from destructive tendencies. From humans, the
aliens might rediscover a lost emotionality, a capacity to feel love
in a more embodied form. From them humans might learn of a
larger reality and open up our earthbound consciousness. After his
fourth session, beginning in June 1992, Peter became a leader
among abductees in communicating openly and publicly about the
details of his experiences and their meaning for his personal and
spiritual growth.
The fifth session was the most complex. Peter 's passage
through the sloping wall of the house on Nantucket became a
powerful metaphoric expression of a transition of consciousness, a
kind of leap of faith into another dimension of reality. Once he
took the fateful '"fourth step" across the barrier, he opened more
fully to his chosen participation in the alien-human breeding program. He discovered, again with a certain shock and even horror
("What about my life on Earth, John? What about my wife?"),
that he apparently had an alien female mate with whom he had
been participating willingly in producing hybrid offspring for the
ultimate purpose of repopulating the earth after "the destruction of
the earth as we know it."
In the sixth session Peter discovered that he felt "part alien"
and began the difficult task of reconciling his human and alien
identities. The session was principally concerned with his opening
t<r--and imparting information about-his sense of the coming
apocalyptic destruction of the earth, the cosmic "negotiation" that
was going on about the future of the planet, and the role he felt
he had agreed to play in creating a race of hybrid beings that represent the next step in human or human/alien evolution.
In the seventh session, in April 1993, Peter experienced the collapse of past, present, and future, and felt that his consciousness
could transcend his body. We explored further the mixture of human, alien, and hybrid beings that he felt would manifest on the
earth after the changes that were to come. Beyond the destruction,
he had a vision of a kind of new millennium, a future "Golden
Age" of openness and learning. In addition to his apparent role in
breeding for this step in evolution, Peter felt he was receiving a
gift of special energy from the alien source that, as a healer, he
could transmit to others toward changing their biological vibrations and enat>ling them to move "through the veil" into another
future.
Peter's case seems to offer answers to certain questions about
what the alien abduction phenomenon may really be about while,
of course, it raises others. It seems to tell us that alien-human interaction may be for the purpose of evolution, both biological and
spiritual. He feels that a new breed or "tribe," a hybrid form, is
being created between the alien race, or races, and human beings.
Peter, and other men and women like him with a dual alien/
human identity, appears to be playing a vital role in the creation
of this tribe or tribes, apparently breeding with an alien or hybrid
mate to produce offspring that would be able to survive in some
sort of postapocalyptic future. At the same time Peter, and others
like him, are experiencing a process of consciousness expansion
or transformation that may enable them to move out of a purely
earthbound existence and become "children of the cosmos." Peter
.feels he also has a role as a teacher in changing the consciousnessof other human beings who are participating or will take part in
this evolutionary process. His experience seems to show that,
whereas all of this seems quite purposive, there is another, more
purely relational aspect of the process, as human beings and aliens
struggle with the task, both traumatic and joyous, of merging their
qualities and identities.
All of this, of course, poses profound ontological questions. In
what domain of reality is this breeding program and .Peter's dual
human/alien identity, for example, taking place? Although to Peter
and many others like him, the process is all too real, we do not
know "where" or "when" any of this is occurring or will happen.
We do not even know whether such words apply. It is as if beings
that are semi-embodied and derive from another dimension, have
taken on the task (or have been recruited to do so by some other,
"higher," intelligence) of becoming embodied to the degree that
they can combine biologically with human beings. But we have
no knowledge of what this complex process, operating as if on the
margin of biology and spirituality, really involves. If it is "genetic" at all in the sense that we know this word, we have no information whatsoever about what the genetic alterations that the
aliens create might be which could permit our species to merge.
From a purely Western scientific/philosophical perspective all
this would have to be dismissed as nonsense. Yet to Peter, whose
psychological health seems to have been established by my time
with him and the formal tests he underwent, these experiences are
so vividly real, so richly textured and consistent, and accompanied
by so much corroborative physical information, that to dismiss
them all out of hand would, it seems to me, shift the burden of
epistemological responsibility to the side of the skeptic.
The same problem of ontological location and definition applies
to Peter's apocalyptic visions. Are these true pictures of what is to
come in a finite time period? Or are these prophetic pictures powerful embodiments projected into human minds (for many
abductees have been experienci ng them) of what in a biospiritual
sense is already occurring on our planet in the form of an emerging eco-disaster whose impact is, evidently, having its effects on
a cosmic scale? Stated in different words, do these images, which
affect experiencers like Peter so vividly as to seem literally predictive and even depressing in terms of the losses of connection
on Earth that they forebode, represent possible futures based on a
kind of extrapolation of our current course? Are these, in effect,
the offering of choices by a higher intelligence whose methods of
intervention are subtle, inviting us to change by offering a rela-
tionship with quasi-embodied intermediaries who reveal us to ourselves at the same time as they change who we are?
On August 26, Peter and I did an eighth session which provides
a kind of postscript to his case. In the session we explored an abduction experience that had occurred a few weeks earlier, at the
end of his vision quest in Montana. He remembered a deeply
emotional and sexually exciting connection with his �en partner,
who had assumed a kind of appealing hybrid form. This was no
longer simply a pragmatic exchange, a bringing together of sperm
and eggs to create a new species. It seems to have been an enjoyable union, awkward in some ways, between a fully embodied human being and another being obviously unversed in the densities
of sexual love. Yet Peter felt disgust and revulsion after the experience ended, at the time it occurred, and once again when he was
coming out of the altered state in which the experience was relived.
What this seems to suggest is that the alien-human relationship
is something far more complex and complete than a program of
hybrid procreation. It appears to be a halting, difficult attempt on
the part of an intelligence of which we know, very little, to create
a merger of two species who seem to need and long for something
each has to offer the other. It is an experiment, which, as far as
we can determine, is as formidable, frustrating, and demanding as
anything its creator has ever undertaken. For it involves nothing
less than bringing races of beings together whose principal homes
until now have been in separate ontological dimensions. Yet, to
make the matter still more complex, there is apparent evidence in
Peter's reports and those of other abductees that humaiis and the
alien beings have derived, or split away, from the same primal
source, and that our deep longing for one another grows out of the
desire to rediscover a lost brotherhood (see the fourth session,
pp. 303-304), to return to one another, and thus come closer once
again to the cosmic "Home" from which, in the experience of Peter and other abductees, we both once emerged.

=====================================================================
CHAPTER FOURTEEN. A BEING OF LIGHT

Carlos* is a fifty-five-year-old man, a husband, and the father of
three grown children-two sons and a daughter. Carlos exercises
his creativity almost daily as he is involved in drawing, painting,
the writing of poetry, drama, academic essays, and a novel; he is
involved as well with theatrical production and the direction of
plays . A fine arts professor, he teaches extremely popular classes
in a small southern college and frequently offers extra courses to
meet the demands of interested students. He has contributed significantly to the cultural environment in his county and state by
volunteering in the state prison system and working with handicapped children, the mentally ill, and the elderly; he also has
worked to address regional environmental issues.
Carlos wrote to me in July 1992, upon the recommendation of
two of the men involved with the Allagash (Fowler 1993) account, about what he felt was a period of lost time on Easter Sunday in 1990. "Six (or more) afternoon hours disappeared during a
hike over a mountain slope" on the Inner Hebrides island of Iona
located in the straits between Ireland and Scotland.
Carlos had previously explored his encounter experiences in
several hypnosis sessions, involving seventeen hours with a psychiatrist near his community, whom we shall refer to as Dr. James
Ward. Carlos spent several days with me in August, during which
*This chapter is the result of an unusual literary collaboration between Edward
Carlos and me. Indeed, he is the co-author of the chapter.
we talked for many hours and I conducted two hypnosis, or relaxation, investigations totaling six hours. Although I use the term
"abduction" in our discussion of his experience, Carlos is emphatic that the experience is an "encounter," and refers to himself
as an "encontrant," and not as a victim or an abductee. He infers
that in some respects he is a participant, a co-ceptor (rather than
a receptor) of the image process and the experience partaken.
Carlos believes this variance in language speaks to a difference in
the manner by which a researcher-hypnotherapist relates to others
in the ufology field and the way in which an artist/encontrant perceives the phenomenon from within.
Carlos's case touches the edge of several of the mysteries that
surround the abduction phenomenon. While shedding light on
some dimensions of the phenomenon, his experiences open profound new questions. As with so many abduction cases, the objective correlates are suggestive and tantalizing-reported UFO
sightings, burned earth where a UFO is said to have landed, unexplained cuts and scars appearing after abduction experiences,
and, above all, dramatic photographs of a light beam reaching
from the clouds to water in a bay at lona. But the weight of the
evidence depends upon the experiences relived in an altered state
of consciousness of a highly intelligen� sensitive, and sincere
man, suffering from no apparent mental illness or distortion of
thinking and perception, who to the best of his ability is seeking
to understand the events that have overtaken him.
The information that Carlos's case provides can be thought of
in two ways, which at first may seem contradictory: either he allows us to gain insight into technologies that we can only imagine
but which a more advanced intelligence has mastered, or we are
being opened to alternate realities, domains of being which are not
part of our accepted universe. But on closer scrutiny this distinction will appear to have little power. For advances in technology
and the expansion of our notions of reality are inseparable. What
is unique to the investigation of the abduction phenomenon, and
well illustrated by this case, is the necessity for human consciousness to expand in order to allow us the capacity to conceive beyond our present technological abilities and perceptions of reality.
Through his personal investigations Carlos-he prefers to be
called by only his last name-has pieced together many encounter
experiences, beginning from when he was three and a half years
old. It is somewhat difficult to distinguish the encounters that
Carlos has been conscious of throughout his life from those that
were brought out during the relaxation sessions that began in Feb-
ruary 1992. As an artist, Carlos has a powerful visual sense. This
has enabled him to be extraordinarily sensitive to the light and energy transmuting forces that are central to his case, and perhaps to
the UFO abduction phenomenon in general. Carlos has had a history of what he calls "visionary" experiences, that he has become
more aware of through his almost thirty hours of hypnosis, and
that he is beginning now to associate with his history of encounters.
In November 1970, Carlos was invited by an Anglican priest
visiting his hometown, who had seen an art exhibit of his on St.
Michael and the Fallen Angels, to do a work of art at the Church
of St. Michael's and All S ai nts in Tollcross, Edinburgh, that
would also be based on the Archangel. After a week in Scotland,
the priest arranged for Carlos to accompany him to the island of
lona. Although he did not .quite know where Iona was or how he
had ever heard of the place, Carlos felt that he had always wanted
to go there. He had images about the monastic history of the island, images with which he felt a sympathetic association. They
traveled by train, and on the way there, while painting watercolor
landscape sketches from the train window, Carlos felt an almost
empathic connection with the land rolling before him and found
himself crying, feeling as if "for the first time in my life I'm going home." Although he had been raised a Roman Catholic, no
one in his family knew of Iona, and Carlos himself had no previous historical interest in it. Nevertheless, he was deeply moved
and excited both en route to the island and as he arrived there by
ferry from the neighboring island of Mull.
Before he had left Edinburgh, an elderly woman, a wellestablished British author who had written several books about
Iona and various historical legends about Scotland in general, invited Carlos to her apartment to discuss his impending journey.
The author told Carlos that when he went to the island he should
go to the beach by the Bay of Seals and sing hymns to communicate with the seals, who, according to local legend, contained
the dead souls of monks who had been killed in the Viking raids.
Modern day monks believe that the Scottish royalty, like the
monks themselves, who were buried on the island, returned as
mermaids (as the seals looked so much like women with large
eyes and long hair coming out of the water). His first morning on
lona, Carlos traversed the one-mile width of the island, from the
town of Iona to that particular beach, and "just for the hell of it,"
sang Gregorian chants ip both Greek and Latin. To his surprise a
seal came close to the shore and followed him for what seemed
about half a mile as he walked along the beach, and it continued
to follow him when he walked back. Charmed by the seal's
friendliness and the legend's apparent authenticity, . Carlos conceded, "It was a very beautiful new experience."
The next night he attended a weekly, traditional village dance
held in the small schoolhouse gym in the little town of Iona; the
music began around midnight. After about two hours of continuous dancing with women visiting the island who were staying at
the abbey a short distance from the community, he was feeling
very free and open, "very wonderful actually." With exuberance
and an energetic vitality, he ran with chest forward, arms out to
his sides "like a cross," down the dark, narrow lane in the heavy,
dense, and cold rain to the end of the dock at the edge of the
small town, the site of his initial arrival on the island. Although
the night was pitch-black and "pouring wet," Carlos reports seeing, over the sea before him, a pink haze like a bubble, perhaps
twenty-five or thirty feet across and "luminous from within." The
luminous mist seemed to form externally before him as a spot
growing from within his vision. There was a subtle flash to its appearance and then it developed large in front of him over the water and in the night sky and was eventually enveloping. Carlos
says that he ingested no intoxicants at the dance and that the bubble was so substantial he believed anyone else who would have
been there could have seen it, not questioning its reality. In "a
second" he was in the bubble form and the scene shifted.
He said he was now no longer a thirty-four-year-old man but
was a twelve-year-old orphan boy on a beach at the end of the island past the abbey, somewhat far from the dock. With him was
a close friend who had modeled for him as St. Michael, as Adam
in the Eden story, and as a fallen angel. The friend is twelve years
younger in "real life," but now was also an orphan and the same
age as Carlos in this other reality, which Carlos calls a "vision."
The vision was of the sixth century, the time of St. Columba, who
is historically associated with Iona. In the vision were two of the
monks of the community and the two adolescent orphans whom
the monks were raising. Carlos recognized one of the monks as
another young man who had modeled for drawings of both Dionysus and Christ for him at home. The second monk he did not
then know.
In the vision, which to Carlos was altogether real, a small boat
came toward shore-a small, squarish beach defined by two large
stone structures or "gates"-from a larger wooden Viking ship.
(The Vikings ha� in fact, sacked Iona several times during the
community's existence.) The monk whom Carlos felt he knew
suddenly fell dead on the beach, followed almost immediately by
the other child, who fell over into his lap, "and I realized he was
dead." The events were very sudden and it is not clear to Carlos
how the two were killed, whether or not, for example, they were
shot with arrows. The surviving monk then ran toward Carlos,
who jumped off the dune on which he was sitting and, grabbing
Carlos by the hand, yelled for him to follow him along the beach.
They ran until they fell beside a nearby large stone jutting out of
the beach on the dune side of one of two huge .rock formations
that acted as a natural gateway to the beach. As they fell, the
monk with his cape "fell over" Carlos to protect him (Carlos did
not know if he was alive or not). The Vikings, "thinking we were
all dead," ran by the survivors and up from the beach into the
fields. The vision ended with a blackout, and Carlos found himself standing on the dock soaking wet, at which point he returned
to the small hotel where he and the priest were staying .
. The nex� morning before they left the island to return to Edinburgh, Carlos felt compelled to return to the Bay of Seals, where
he sang chantS again "to see if the seal would come back." The
morning was overcast and stormy, the rain having continued all
night and into the day. Carlos "climbed out over a treacherously
wet peninsula of large boulders and rocks to stand overlooking the
dark waters which seemed to boil in a great upheaval beside me.
With the storm all around me, I sang the 'Dies lrae' and the 'Asperges Me' from the Gregorian chants. A huge, white sea lion
with large, white tusks rose up out of those black waters and
scared the hell out of me. I didn't understand this. Everything was
too much!"
Carlos returned to Edinburgh and completed his project, Michael's Triumph, painting a series of translucent hangings on chiffon and satin that captured the qualities of light on the island and
depicted a passage from the Apocalypse. Included in the hangings
were several life-size male nudes representing the fallen angels
displayed behind the central figure of the Archangel Michael. For
almost twenty years, the church authorities displayed the large
hanging for two months each fall, from St. Michael's Day to All
Saints' Day, during the time of an annual pilgrimage to the church
from other parishes throughout Scotland.
Two months after Carlos returned to his hometown, a man who
Carlos felt was the young monk who had saved him in the vision
showed up on his college campus as a freshman and came to his
office to inquire about taking art courses with him. Carlos reacted
with amazement and disbelief. The two felt instantly that they
knew each other and a friendship ensued. The realization that he
had perhaps somehow in his vision been able to look into the future affected Carlos deeply and reinforced his determination to return some day to Iona.
Carlos is of mixed Spanish, Scottish, Iri sh, German, and
German-Jewish extraction. His surname is somehow related to the
Spanish Armada and its demise in the Irish/Scottish Herbrides
perhaps off the island of Mull next to Iona. He grew up in a small
village in western Pennsylvania in a Catholic family. His parents,
young adults during the Depression era, were hard workers who
retained their ardent Catholic faith. Each parent, raised on a farm,
especially valued schooling since they had been able to attend and
achieve an education through junior high school, as was typical in
small town and rural life in the early part of this century. Carlos's
sister, ten years older than Carlos, and like her parents a faithful
Catholic, married when Carlos was a child. She and her husband
had four children and they remained in the small town where she
and Carlos were born. When Carlos was sixteen, his father, a
small town entrepreneur and eventually a laborer on the railroad,
died during a working day of a heart attack, having had a history
of cigarette smoking. Confronting death has been continuous in
Carlos's life, and this event drastically affected him. To begin
with, Carlos had to go with his mother and sister to the county
coroner's morgue to identify the body, which was a traumatic experience. "I had never been in a morgue before. Seeing my father
on a slab, on a table, and my mother screaming, crying, and kissing him even, I just collapsed on the floor and cried." Carlos's
mother went on to · manage their country all-general and grocery
store until her retirement, then assisted in the preparation of dinners for his only sibling's catering service.
Carlos was encouraged by his family to pursue an education,
particularly in art education, and he completed three degrees and
the equivalent of a fourth-including an MFA degree, having concentrated in painting and sculpture; the equivalent of a second
MA degree in art therapy; and a Ph.D. in comparative arts. He
credits his developing his natural artistic ability to his sister 's influence and encouragement. Carlos married when he was twentysix and after he completed his Ph.D., he and his wife, a
mathematics teacher, moved to a university community on a
mountaintop in the South where they raised their three children.
Although teaching full time, Carlos continued to avidly pursue his
own creative productions.Throughout his life Carlos has suffered from respiratory difficulties related to various allergies. When he was a year old and
had respiratory pneumonia, a nurse informed his parents that he
was clinically dead. His frantic parents rushed him to a hospital,
where a low pulse rate was discovered and he was placed in an
oxygen tent. Under hypnosis with Dr. Ward, Carlos recounted
feeling that . "the child I had been, died" and "the light creature"
he had been previously "took over the dead baby's body ...
Coming into the body was very painful," Carlos says. He experienced intense "resistance to taking on a body ... I love having a
body," Carlos pronounced but then added, "but I did not want to
come [to Earth]. The body is prone to so many problems. The
body reacts to everything. It is like a jellyfish on the beach; every
stimulation, every incoming microbe. The cellular structure is
continually shifting and changing. Growing up was hard. Aging is
hard. All the things the body goes through. And, it is never still,
never truly peaceful."
Under hypnosis, Carlos described the sensation of reentering
his infant body around age one. "I felt like I was sliding into it,
like you put on socks and shoes and trousers. I would pop into the
fingers and pop into the toes and pop into the muscles. It was
painful and it hurt. I did not like the feeling of it; I thought it was
messy; I thought it was nauseating; I thought it was disturbing. It
was a fat, grubby little baby that could not do anything. It had no
real presence. It was such a different dimension. It was such a descending."
In a hypnosis session with Dr. Ward, Carlos told of feeling that,
despite the pain of becoming embodied again around age one, he
somehow "volunteered to come to physical Earth ... I chose to
accept the body," he said. W hen I asked him why he had
"agreed," he spoke of his responsibilities as a teacher and an artist. He is deeply troubled about the failure of human beings to
treat "their potentialities very well," and has been concerned all
his life by our predatory destruction of the "Earth garden." Using
art, he is teaching " 'the aesthetic of transcendence' . . . Through
art processes I am helping people to be more empathic that they
might better understand and identify with those things that are not
of themselves, so that they won 't destroy them."
The first encounter experience Carlos recalled occurred in the
late summer or early fall of 1940, when he was three and a half
years old, in association with a display of aurora borealis (northern lights). Such events were quite uncommon in Pennsylvania,
and Carlos recalls the apocalyptic reaction of some of his neigh-
bors. The experience was awesome for Carlos, too, and has remained with him powerfully all his life; he says the spectacle of
the colored lights in the sky affects the way he paints as an adult.
As a child, Carlos was so intrigued by this event that he did not
want to go to bed .. "I was angry because my parents made me go
to bed eventually. I thought it was the most significant experience
of my entire young life, and I was told to get dressed in my pajamas and go to sleep. But my dad worked on the railroad and
awakened at four-thirty A.M. in order to be at work by six o' clock.
I did not get in bed immediately, however. Instead I went and
looked out the window. Then I yelled at my parents, 'Mommy,
Daddy, I see an angel.' My dad yelled back, 'That's nice. Now,
you get in bed.' " The child, Carlos, could not understand his parents' attitude on "the most important day of my entire life." The
angel jmage was "a yellow light or a yellow haze" that he says
moved toward him, and he associated it with the blond-haired, androgynous angel statue he had seen under the family Christmas
tree which fascinated him. As a child he used to play with the
statue of the angel as if it were an airplane, making it fly around
at the base of the tree and land on the limbs or on the top of the
manger. The angel was the most important image of his recollections of that season.
In our first hypnosis session Carlos explained that out of
the "amorphous yellow angel shape" there emerged "one of the
skinny little white creatures with the big eyes," a type of alien being he has reported in several relaxation sessions. "It was a little creature like myself, about my height. It .was skinny and it
had a large head for its body and it had very large eyes. The eyes
were almond shaped, catlike." The eyes were "brilliant blue
sometimes, as if they were illuminated from within." The creature
was "bald, no hair, no features on the body. I was not sure about
the hands. I never felt they were quite hands like my hands although I have seen this creature several times." Instead of fingers
it seemed to have "claws or pincers. I am never sure if there were
two, three, or four digits, but it seems to be two." Later Carlos felt
that he might be confusing the "hands" of the various creatures he
is aware of, who he feels might be categorized into four races or
species types. He senses that the hands he referred to are most
likely those of larger robotic creatures which actual ly vary in
shape and form depending on the functions they perform. He feels
that the various species are interrelated and co-functional .
Then Carlos reported how as a child he lifted "in the air in a
mirror image of the small creature" and went out through the win-
dow and "tlew" with the being. "It took me all over the hills
around my home and flying was to me, wonderlul. I just thought
it was great fun. I even once turned over on my back and then returned to the regular position." He flew beside the creature
and seemed to be held and propelled by the energy of the light
in which they were immersed. "I was aware of distances. I
was aware of movement, of color as deep hazes in the sky. I was
aware of distant stars. There were lights beyond the stars and
planets, way beyond." Sometimes he feels he has intermixed this
experience of flight with experiences of being lifted and transported through a light tunnel from one site to another, such as to
the interior of a craft. Aying is a recurring motif in some of his
more vivid dreams.
As he took his "tour of the farming neighborhood," Carlos had
the feeling that he had done this before, "before I was a little kid,
pre-creature," i.e., before he had become embodied with human
countenance. It was an "awesome [a word Carlos used frequently
in our discussion] experience" to go like this "back to the light."
Carlos found it difficult to describe the quality of this experience
of metamorphoses and transubstantial bodily-material changes in
fonn and energy, an experience he has had during other encounters. He felt that he literally "dissolves" or "cellularly disassembles" through a painful process of "breaking from material fonn
into the light energy," i.e., he becomes the sky or the light itself,
which "permeates everything." The creature accompanied his return to "the energy light place. It took me back to where I had
come from-before I came into my body, before I becan1e a
body-which was light, an energy light place." The creature itself,
he said, "is only a fonn of light, emerging from out of the light."
Although geographic in one sense, the experience of the light
was also "out of space. It was not space/time." I asked him where
his consciousness was located in the experience. "I was consciousness; the experience was consciousness, a pure soul experience. Soul is the endlessness of it," he said. "The essence of the
experience is of an energy which is pre-fonn." Carlos also tried to
describe the "beauty" of the movement. He was still talking of the
experience from age three and a half. Carlos is adamant that the
event was as he described it and that what came up in this hypnotic session was not an intermingling of associations from various experiences. He also says that other later experiences affirmed
this imagery of the light from the first hypnotic session. "This
transformation was from my second hypnosis session. The return
to the light-energy form at age three and a half later was part of
A BEING OF liGHT 339
a reinstruction to assist me in reaccepting the original i ntent of accepting human form. The experience of the light reoccurred at
least in three hypnotic sessions."
Carlos observed, "You are within the universe's energy. You are
that movement of energy and light, but you are aware of the
'spacelessness' of it. The word 'spacelessness' is as close as I can
come to an objectivity of any kind . . . I think I've tried to paint
that feeli ng or sensation actually without knowing I was painting
it. It is like swimming under water. You can see forms, and you
can see distance, and you can see light. But you cannot see your
body. Your body is water anyway, so if you can see beyond the
scope of the body then that is what it was like." The experience
was "joyous, one of the most breathtaking experiences I have had
in my life. I think I have painted this light all of my life. I mean,
literally." Carlos has frequently created large art works-oil paintings and mixed media drawings--<>f skies, clouds, and vistas.
These paintings and drawings have culminated in an exhibition
entitled Lightfall, first presented in November 1992; the entrance
piece is of a photograph of a lightfall taken on his second trip to
Iona dunng a period of apparent loss of consciousness.
When he was five, Carlos again developed respiratory pneumonia with a high fever and near coma that threatened his life. As
his doctor thought his infections were related to allergies (and
possibly also a result of his continual exposure to cigarette
smoke), his parents took him across the state to Philadelphia for
tests. In the course of his hospitalization, Carlos "had over two
hundred, perhaps as many as four hundred pricks on my skin" to
test for possible allergic agents. In the middle of the testing he developed measles which resulted in his being quarantined so that
his parents were not allowed to visit. This was a traumatic period
for him.
In an earlier hypnosis session with Dr. Ward, Carlos had described what might have been an out-of-body experience during
this illness, in which he reported being visited once again by three
or four little creatures with large eyes, like the one that had come
to his house when he was three and a half. He returned once again
to a place of light, energy, or power from which he could look
down on his body�
Carlos attributes his recovery from pneumonia to his experience
of the application of a healing light energy beamed into his body
by the alien creatures. He describes the process as "like laser
beams coming into my body through the soles of the feet and the
hands, and possibly through the sides of the lower torso, radiatingthroughout the whole body, expanding and changing color as the
light grew to fit the whole body · interior, thereby healing it." At
the point where the fever broke "the yellow interior core, which
was surrounded by an orange mass further surrounded by a hazy
pink-mauve-red color array, and then the healing light was edged
by very crisp blue and green bands at the inner surface of the
skin. The green and blue edge was the breaking point, the cooling
so to speak. Then my body reacted again after this long, long illness." At this point, finally, he said the creatures "brought me
back. I went into the body."
In our relaxation session, as in the experience itself, Carlos felt
an intense reluctance to "come back" to his body. "I was crying
and sobbing not to come back to this life, to this awareness. But
the creatures brought me back." Carlos reports continuing to cry
and scream as he came out of the session, during which he had
had considerable difficulty breathing and experienced the sensation of itching and changing body temperatures. "I was crying and
then I was angry. My emotions were running all over the place."
As he walked down the hallway, leaving Dr. Ward's office to go
to the bathroom at the other end of the building, Carlos felt fierce
and wild to the point where he was afraid he could kill someone,
"like a lion. I felt shamanistic." With long, shoulder-length hair,
Carlos looks rather leonine.
Carlos can describe no other abduction-related experiences
from his childhood or adolescence. But from his undergraduate
years at a state teachers' college in western Pennsylvania to the
present, he has had a number of them. When he was still a student, while attending_ a family reunion, he reports having seen "a
huge-baseball field in size-round, flying craft, shaped like a
saucer, upside down on top of another saucer, separated by a dull
metallic-like band, of windows probably, around the center of the
outer circumference. It was, other than the window band, highly
reflective and a shiny silver. Most of my relatives and I were out
in the yard, other than my mother, grandmother, and aunts who
were in the kitchen. The spacecraft stayed in one spot without
moving for at least twenty minutes, long enough for everybody to
look at it, long enough for me to go into the house, drag my
mother out on the porch to look at it. Then the ship took off and
was out of sight within seconds in a clear, straight, silent streak.�'
A year later he also reports seeing a large fireball one night,
"bigger than my car but not as big as the spaceship" a mile from
his home. "The fireball flew parallel alongside my car but out in
the field and some feet up in the air, and then it shot back through
the woods, splintering into four smaller lights, which broke away
in four directions as it disappeared." At first Carlos thought it
must be a meteor, but it did not behave like one and he was nonplused by its appearance. He does not remember stopping, but arrived home two hours later than he should have. He has recalled
a few sketchy details of an abduction experience in relation to this
episode.
Carlos's most distressing abduction experiences, marked sometimes by nausea and other physical symptoms, are those that have
involved his children-he and his wife have two sons, who are
now twenty-eight and twenty-six, and a twenty-four-year-old
daughter who recently married. Carlos wept in my presence when
he recalled the trauma of being unable to protect them in their
youth. "I am paralyzed and they take the boys from my arms," he
laments, trying to control his sobbing. He says he has seen his
daughter on a ship as a little girl "reaching out to touch some of
the instruments and I did not want her to do that. I was so scared
about her touching them !"
Carlos suspects that his health problems, including his allergies
and respiratory illnesses, are related to probes and implants from
his abduction encounters. He has had two nasal septum operations
because of breathing difficulties, frequently gets sinus and respiratory infections, and continually takes over-the-counter medication
to keep his nasal passages clear. When Carlos was in his forties,
a tumor was removed from behind his right eye, which he attributed at the time to leaking asbestos in his work area at school but
now suspects is related to probing and implantation during his abduction experiences. He believes that his eye surgery impaired his
ability to focus and has forced him to need glasses. He also questions the cause of a later hard growth on his forehead outside the
area of the interior tumor. Several years ago a mark or bruise on
his lower body was diagnosed as cancerous. The cancer went into
remission after an operation, but Carlos attributes the remission to
the transmutation of light energies that he experiences through
gardening and daily painting with watercolors at sunset and also
relates it to the energies transmitted to him by the abduction process.
Carlos believes that identifying with other species in his abduction experiences also helps create and develop ecological values.
The outdoors has appealed to Carlos since his childhood-"!
played in nature a lot. I grew up in the woods, playing the Tarzan
myth"-and he has always had a strong connection with animals.
Dogs and cats were constant pets in his youthful country home.
He had two horses during his j unior high and high school years
and spent hours riding in the hills of Pennsylvania. "I think I am
really good with animals. I feel we communicate." He is surrounded with dogs and cats in his adult life, which follow him on
daily walks around the lakes, in the open fields, and through the
woods near his home. Carlos supports animal rights and has spent
rriuch time working for environmental awareness.
In his hypnosis sessions with Dr. Ward, Carlos recovered some
material relating to the Iona episode, which entailed two significant encounters, and he has described further details in lengthy
conversations and two regressions with me. For several reasons, it
is difficult to obtain a coherent, temporal narrative of the encounter. Carlos's way of thinking tends to be nonlinear with associations that move about in time. Further, a collapse of space/time
order or structure is common in the experience and reexperience
of encounters, but this is particularly so in Carlos's narratives. In
the case of an experience as rich in images, sensations, and emotions as the Iona encounter, a precise order of events is virtually
impossible to establish. Where such narrative order seems possible, I have stayed with it. Otherwise the basic themes of these experiences, which covered approximately a six-hour period, are set
down in a sequence that seems logical or appropriate but is not
necessarily temporally correct. I will begin with those events that
Carlos remembered consciously.
When Carlos returned to Iona twenty years after his first visit,
in April 1990, he had professional reasons to do so-research on
the Christian hymns and poetry of St. Columba and the imagery's
possible relation to Druidic poetry honoring the earth and the feminine in nature--but his personal wish was "to validate the visionary experiences." Carlos thought that if he could find a particular
cave that had come up in a hypnosis session a year after his first
visit to Iona, or if he could find remnants of the stone gate, neither of which was present on any maps of the island� it would verify both his vision and his regression experience. (In the session,
he and the young monk had hidden, crouching low in a small
cave on that black, damp night.) Carlos planned to spend only two
days at the most on Iona. But car trouble on Mull over the Easter
holiday forced him to extend his stay on Iona to about ten days.
And thus the experience that is the centerpiece of this case occurred. c
His first day on the islan<L Carlos climbed on rocks he felt were
those he had seen in the vision. He felt that he knew intuitively
where the cave was, although he had not seen it on his first trip.
The water was high. He saw fissures in the rock but could not
find the cave. He thought to himself, "I just imagined this," but
reported "it troubled me terribly." He took a few photographs and
left. A night or two later he returned when the tide was low ("I'd
never thought about the tide"), walked around the cliff in one of
· the rock structures, the one nearest the large stone on the beach he
had fallen beside, "and there was the cave." He entered it and
"hunkered down" inside the cave as he had in the vision. The impact of his discovery was powerful for Carlos. He "felt great" because this meant to him "that my visionary experiences were real,
that they were validated, and that I was dealing with truth."
On Easter Sunday, April 1 5, after Carlos had been on Iona for
three or four days, he started a journey across the mountainous island to St. Columba's B ay, a three-hour walk from the village past
the Bay of Seals, in order to obtain green pebbles which he intended to give to his children. He started off at noon, in order to
make it back before dark, climbing over the plains to a mountain
summit in the central western portion of the island. He reached a
plateau near the top of the island and walked perhaps thirty to
forty steps off the path to urinate against a ledge. When he turned
back toward the path he found that he was strangely confused and
dazed, even dizzy, and he had trouble walking. Everything looked
different and he did not recognize his surroundings, although he
realized he was on the island. At first he could not find the path,
and when he thought he had found it he did not recognize where
he was on it. Shortly he realized he was going in the opposite direction he intended--down rather than up. When he turned around
to continue his progress up the mountain, he observed that probably two or three hours ("watches don't run on me so I do not
ever carry watches") had passed and it was too late to be able to
complete· the five- or six-hour trip he had planned to St. Columba's Bay and still be back before dark. Deciding he would go the
next day, he headed back, somewhat stumbling as he was still in
an altered state of consciousness, and soon arrived at the
maercher, a kind of field above a beach, that overlooked the B ay
of Seals.
From this field he reports seeing over the bay before him a
great, long, peach-colored shaft of light descending from the thick
clouds to the surface of the water. It seemed to him "miraculous,
awesome, eerie, and uncanny." When it struck the water, the shaft
made a huge peach-colored circle from which peach-colored mist
rose. He saw thousands of sparks inside and outside of the circle
"jumping all over the water like the sparklers that kids get on theFourth of July." (Later, during hypnosis, he described the beam as
a "lightfall," a "tunnel" connecting to a spaceship.) Remembering
he had his camera with a close-up lens hanging around his neck,
he shot a picture, focusing on the water while walking backwards
so as to get as much of the beam, the clouds, and the circle on the
water's surface in the picture as possible. Carlos describes this as
"the most incredible, natural event I have ever seen."
I have seen his photograph, which includes smaller light shafts
radiating downward off the main one to the water that Carlos had
not noticed at the time. The picture was taken with slide film. After a print was made, Carlos took it to two colleagues in the physics department at his local university. At first they speculated that
the beam could be a solar pillar, but then ruled that out on the basis of its shape, the wide arc, and the haze and spark activity in
and above the water where the light struck. Also, Carlos calculated that, at that time, the sun would have been setting farther to
the northwest than the beam was located. Carlos himself teaches
photography and does not believe that it was a sunbeam, and does
not refer to it as a "beam" or "ray of light," but rather, as a
"lightfall." The more senior of the two physicist colleagues
looked up Iona and reported excitedly to Carlos that St. Columba
had seen such a light too.
After taking the picture, Carlos reports that a light came over
and enveloped him and he "blanked out," falling toward the
ground. He is not certain if this was the same light he saw or another that was directed at him, but the color was the same pinkpeach. When he "woke up" it was after dark and he was sitting
on the beach "about a hundred or more yards away in a complete
daze." Although he could not see the beam of light anymore, he
did see a cloud "that was glowing and pulsating with an C?range
light." The sun had set already. He took another picture (which
shows small, short light beams coming from the cloud). Then he
started back toward the town, walking in the darkness. He took
yet another picture, but the light glow was dimmer and the rays
were gone. Remarkably, immediately thereafter Carlos had no
memory of any of these events. He told me that he walked over
the mountain to St. Columba's Bay, and, grinning, said, "and I got
my green pebbles." In fact, he had no recollection of the light
beam until four months later when he looked at the slides from
the trip for the first time.
The actual encounter, as described under hypnosis, began with
a shift of consciousness after Carlos urinated and he experienced
himself ascending to and in through the bottom of a ship in a
laserlike tunnel of light. On the ship he found himself facing "a
sweet little creature" who took him along passages on the ship. At
the beginning of the encounter the creature seemed to draw him
from one enclosure to another by reaching out its arm. Several
types of alien beings were involved in his encounter. There were
"little light creatures" like the one who accompanied him through
the ship and escorted him down passageways. "They scurry
around dronelike, very busy, and pay no attention to me" once
within the structure, and they performed various functions. Their
heads were round and white, with no hair, "like a bald person."
He perceived their eyes as "bright, deep luminous blue," rather
than black which is more commonly reported by others; Carlos
explained, however, that the color changes, and it is not just a
matter of perception. "The color has to do with communication
and control."
Carlos reported that the large eyes sometimes look as if they
have "goggles" over them, especially when they are seen at night
or outdoors, which might be part of or parallel to the eye structure. "There is some confusion to me about whether this is actual
'flesh, ' or if what I describe [under hypnosis] are in fact goggles
or a part of a helmet." A close-fitting helmet appeared in a later
relaxation session; prior to that I asked him to describe the eyes,
and "it is possible I was describing either or both. It is like looking through thick glasses, but I see their material, their viscous
flesh. Their eyeballs or lenses are transparent so it seems black to
people in the dark." Behind the "goggles" Carlos felt he had seen
a vertical slitlike pupil, which he describes as catlike, and a wide
circular iris "with browns and reds moving around," narrowing
and widening, contracting and expanding "not unlike our eyeball."
The changes of color seem to "go all around the circle of the iris."
To Carlos the creatures do not fit a stereotypical description,
and some whole species seem androgynous. In his examination
experiences, Carlos has found that there is frequently a larger,
"most likely female," entity who seems to control some of the
programs (she calmed Carlos when he became afraid in one session). He described her as gray, but said often the haze about her
is changing colors, "radiating roseness, mauveness, pinks, and orange." There is "always a mist around her . . . She is thin, resembling the little ones, only she is taller and therefore appears more
elongated; she has the same eyes and there is hardly a nose and
hardly a mouth."
Carlos described rooms of varying sizes on the ship as having
curved ceilings and passages between them. One room he called"a rotunda; the room is large." Another had "a lower half and an
upper half' with "a lot of electrical-like ceiling lines, like the
veins in a brain. On the side between these halves were window
or screen areas which were all around the center of the space.
They could walk on that balcony and look out, it is like a twoway mirror; it offers a projection place or a screen as well. It is ,
as if these window-screens are made of a combination of metal/
crystal/mirror/glass." If he were to represent this in art, Carlos
said he would create a cloudscape or landscape on suspended
plastic sheets, one in front of another. He had done works on chiffon with acrylic earlier, after his work in Edinburgh, utilizing similar materials, which fie suspects may be related to this perception
of the screen 'Which doubles as a window. He continued describing
the room, "There is a balcony level at these windows with a railing. From the balcony there are slanted surfaces on the tops of
machines which extend from the floor level of the balcony and
railing down to the floor beneath. At the base are desks, yellowbeige in color, with instruments on panels at the desks. Small
creatures are busily moving around in the lower space or they are
seated at the controls at the base of the slanted walls." Carlos described walking on the balcony and looking out of the windows
that ran horizontally.
During the experience in Iona, as in other abduction encounters,
Carlos experienced intense physical pain, fear, and nausea. Most
disturbing to Carlos were large, robotlike creatures with large,
black eyes that appeared to have reptilian and insectile facial qualities and insectile body characteristics. "I don't have any problems
facing the little ones that are so blissful, or the taller ones, but the
ugly ones scare and repulse me," he said. The reptile-faced,
insect-bodied robots were "brought forth" by the female entity to
perform specific functions. "She is like a doctor/philosopher/
psychologist of sorts. This is an operation, but it is more than
merely a physical examination," he says.
The instrumentati'
on "fucking hurts the nerves," he said. But, he
added, "it is not the cutting; that is not the hurt. It is your own
fear that you do not know what is happening, because although it
has happened before and you sense this, you forget previous times
to some respect although memory is awakened during your contact with them, and you see these robotic machines coming at you
that look so weird and strange." Nausea, Carlos said, comes when
the fear becomes too intense, particularly in relation to the reptilian machine. "I see it as this creature that scares me and I get nauseated, and the nausea is from the fear. It is not from what they
A BEING OF liGHT 347
are doing . · . . The robotic creature, like the female-type entity, has
a pink or rose haze around it. I'm afraid of it; it is monstrous. It
has an insectian quality in its body with reptilian facial features.
It comes directly at you . . . I look away. It is like a larva inside
the leather-a hard, dark, scary machine. We see it this way because we are interpreting its surface as flesh which seems to be a
leather/metal combination. The robot is an operational functioning
mechanism, perhaps a biomechanical creature; it is a mental construct of theirs. They can form it, and then we can perceive it."
Because the looming perception of this creature in our first session had nauseated Carlos, I suggested he block it out and continue with other aspects of the experience we were pursuing. Once
out of the altered state of consciousness, however, he said that he
wanted to face his fears in a hypnotic session, and to a large degree, this was why he had sought my assistance. It was important
to him to face his fear of these robotic creatures; he did not feel
fear with the other species. The nausea and fear had persisted
from his very first hypnosis session, he said, during which he
could not speak at all, but previously it had always been related
to the examinations or to those scenes involving his children and
their separation from him. In our second session he was able to
confront these perceptions in detail and move through this part of
the experience.
In spite of the distress associated with this encounter, Carlos simultaneously experienced this Iona encounter as purifying, enriching, and even ecstatic, a paradox which is consistent with other
abductees' experiences as they are described in many researchers '
theses.
This aspect of his experience is best conveyed in his account of
events surrounding the vision of peach-colored light. After Carlos
took the first picture of the lightfall, he walked backwards while
looking through the camera lens to get another fuller image that
would include the clouds above the bay. Then he explained that
the light, perhaps a beam, came over him and he felt a "tingling"
in his body and started to fall down. He fell backwards in what
seemed a brilliant flash of light initially, "with my hands up to
protect my eyes from the light . . . I was surrounded by this huge
circle of peach-pink mist just dancing and moving all around me,
and then I was taken up or lifted upward into the ship and I think
I might have been nude but I'm not sure. I was in another time.
I don't know how the nakedness happened when it did." He had
difficulty here distinguishing among the details of various encoun-ters; he knew that nakedness was a condition of his examination
at some point in the encounter phenomenon.
As he was going up through this beam of light he reported that
he saw "the edge of the ship in the clouds" and "went in again
through the bottom." After this, within the craft, he saw a group,
perhaps between five and nine, of "the little white creatures."
They were standing in a "white, shiny, luminous haze ... I knew
they were trying to teach me something. The eyes were the last
thing I saw, those blue eyes, and then they completely disappeared
into the fog or mist. They went through a whole process of color
changes before they totally hazed out into light and this was beautiful." The mention of fog made me wonder if he was really on
the ship at that point in the description. "I am," Carlos said. ''The
haze was in this vessel." Later, Carlos expressed his sense that the
empathic nature in perceiving was part of the message; throughout
his art teaching career, he has always stressed that it is essential
to identify with the subjective nature of the "objects" involved
with the creative work.
Early in our second relaxation session Carlos expressed feeling
intense sensations as, in reliving the experience with the light, he
perceived its transformative nature. Initially I confused this reference to light as indicating the beam coming over him when he
was "shot back up." However, attempting to clarify these experiences later, Carlos affirmed that there was a difference between
the light experience in which "a sort of physical, cellular, molecular change occurred in my body" as he was taken up into the
craft and "that ecstatic experience which seemed transformative,
also physical but with an intent and within a spiritual dimension.
The ecstatic aspect of this experience, although similar in some
manifestations, was meditatively provocative." He described
"beautiful" tingling feelings that grew into a full orgasm in which
his body went into a convulsive spasm lasting nearly half a minute before an interruption occurred in the process while he gasped,
moaned, screamed, panted, and even growled. The intensity of his
reaction caused the bed on which he was lying during the session
to shake violently. After this experience subsided Carlos was "in
darkness" but could "see the light." He resisted coming back from
this sensation but his consciousness was already actively returning
at my suggestion. He continued for a while to feel tingling sensations as we spoke and he described an "alive" feeling or vital
peace. "It is life!" he affrrmed.
It is possible to think, as Carlos does, of any abduction experience in terms of the transmission of information-from the aliens,
or whatever they may represent, to the experiencer; from the experiencer to the person selected to report the information (myself
in this case); and, finally, from the reporter to his readers or listeners. In each instance the reporter selects and interprets among
the various data, stressing some bits of information over others,
which itself is a kind of interpretation. In Carlos's case information about the technobiologies involved in the transmutation or
metamorphosis of the body-as-matter into forms of energy seems
to constitute the core meaning or central importance of his story.
Why he has been given this information remains mysterious. It
seems fitting that he is an artist who is deeply resonant with light
phenomena to begin with. But that does not tell us very much.
The April 1 5, 1990, abduction experience on lana was particularly
rich in information regarding these processes. And Carlos indicated this is a worthwhile place to pursue our investigations.
·
There are two periods in the lana encounter that are noteworthy
in this respect. The first occurs as the light beam comes over
Carlos at the start of the second part of the abduction experience,
when he feels he is being taken up into the craft. The second relates to some sort of crystal instrumentation on the ship. Carlos
says that the crystalline machinery carne up in some sessions with
Dr. Ward. It seems to have to do with televised/projected imagery
of a miniature holographic nature, in which particular and multiple
personal life scenes are played out while he watches. .
Carlos identifies "sparks of light" that are "essential little cores
of being-energy" with the lightfall itself. After the beam of light
came over him-which he regards as connected to sexual energy;
as , for example, the frenzied orgasm he relived during our
session-his body seemed to go "in layers . . . expanding and
contracting in the mist." He felt a vibratory tingling sensation in
his body and then the sense that "my body is dissolved or diffused
into its transparency . . . The body just dissolves and goes up.
Then I am transparent. I have a sense of the interior transparent
shell of the body which is not part of its physicality but yet it is
connected. It is the shape and mold and form of the physicality.".
He continued, 'The molecular structure, cellular structure of the
body, just goes out into the light-:-.. It is the transformation from
one state of being into another state of being, but you carry the
core of a residual shape . . . it is like a ghost image. The image
is the memory of the body, and it is clear and it is there and it has
form and it shoots (moves with a certain intense direction and
strength); I shoot; I go up. I'm head first." I asked where he goes
then. "I go into the light, and the light is molten-core, volcanic,liquid fire, but it is light and it is white and my transparency is
adaptable to that and there is a silver clarity to my shooting up."
The light is "like a viscous membrane that you go through, but it
is not a solid thing. It is receptive (the body as to the experience
of the energy change), and I don 't know; it is like I envision a female orgasm (would be)."
He said that as he ascended and entered the vessel, and went
fully into the light within the craft, it became orange, yellow, and
white, a kind of "spectrum of color." After this he was in the "rotunda" in the spacecraft, entering at the balcony level. He believed
he probably ascended alone this time, but reported seeing ten or
twelve of the small, white creatures once he was in the craft.
Carlos then found himself in the large, instrument-filled room previously described, with many busy creatures all about him. His
presence was not acknowledged by any of the� so he had a
sense of anonymity and there was a lack of expectation or anticipation regarding him. He was, however, guided by one of the
creatures down a ramp to a lower level where there was a kind of
black, marblelike platform b ase or narrow hallwaylike floor
around a central, circular platform upon which were crystal structures. The floor resembled a "dance floor'' composed of "dense
matter." It was not solid but he could stand on it, feeling that he
was standing on open space beneath him in the black, dense matter. The floor in this circular floorway was in the interior of the
room but around the outside of the platform. Also on this lower
level, he saw little "desks" with buttons like computer technology
on the outer edges of the large, high-ceilinged room. Little creatures were sitting at these and were involved with the machinery.
A higher balcony area with windows could also be seen above
them; the balcony with its own walkway opened toward the inside
but had a railing. The walkway or balcony ramp surrounded the
entire circle and had exterior windows.
Carlos explained that he had been on a kind of table which was
also "a block of crystal" within which or upon which he was situated, depending, he clarifie<L on the aspect of the investigation
performed on him. The female creature, described previously, was
present and "like a spiritual doctor" and brought forth the
reptilian-faced, insectile-bodied, or robotlike entities who in turn
were to perform "an operation" that was achingly painful and was
carried out by an instrument Carlos described thus: "Whatever
these crystals are, metal-like more than glasslike, there is light. I
can see it [one of the particular crystal instruments used in the examinations]. It is like a squared tube of crystal with the sides
lopped off so that at the ends, each tube appears eight-sided, but
it is big in the middle and little on the edges, like it is mitered.
And then the end of it is shaped like a step-pyramid. It shoots laser light into the body, but it feels like a needle because it hurts,
and it resembles a needle."
Carlos defined some differences in the seemingly overlapping
expressions of material that appeared in his relaxation sessions.
''The following situation as described is from another time other
than the lona experience in my later life; I think it is from when
I was a child at five years old with pneumonia In the previous
paragraphs where the 'sketchy details' are mentioned, I believe I
described what probably are related memories, in particular to the
encounter when I was a young man seeing the fireball. One recall
under hypnosis seems to provoke more than one memory simultaneously, but some of the processes of transformation differ, apparently for various purposes or intentions. There are subtle
differences depending on the function of the metamorphosis or the
investigation which I have come to believe is also metamorphic,
i.e., that functional changes are introduced. Those who focus on
the examinations only provide a simpler interpretation of the experience, a surface explanation that is more easily ascribed. The
crystal 'table' was used during examinations, at least once, but
probably each time an examination occurs. It is possible that other
'encontrants' refer to a table and even remember a table because
it is more pertinent to our regular life experience, i.e., that that
particular symbol comes forth and we infer it as a table per se ...
The large crystal structure, however, is located in the center of the
lower rotunda area, and is a different mechanism; it is operationally and functionally distinct from the smaller instruments utilized
in the exams. The larger crystal structure is usually involved in a
'teaching' situation, but the teaching is inherently metaphorical as
opposed to in any way being verbally or definitely explanatory."
Carlos continued with his clarification and included as well in
this description parenthetical details to clarify or fulfill the verbal
shorthand of altered state descriptions, "I went through that
body--cracldng (apart) an experience regarding the light which is
not unlike when I was healed from the fever. First, the light is in
the body. The light is a gold core which reaches out through the
yellows and oranges . . . the center core is inside an aura. (This
takes place) Inside the body. It (the light mechanism) continues
(invading and permeating the interior of the body-muscles, tissue, organs, blood, nerves, et cetera) to the edge right next to the
skin; it is when the skin dissolves, an atomic cellular dissolving,and then the green and blue precise edges are there (at the dermis
and epidermis), and it (the light manifestation, the light mechanism of healing) can form the flesh, and it can take the flesh (i.e.,
change it)." This process is associated with itching. Carlos tended
to rub or scratch his body during his hypnotic recall. Then he felt
"pressure, a tightening. The body gets really tight, but at the same
time, it is fleshing out. It is like it's being pumped up ... I can
feel it just dimly now, but it is like it gets bigger. The light
spreads out; it fleshes full. The white molten light is in the center
where the yellow was (and has expanded and now has become).
I see the light (spread or array) as yellow in itself, and then it expands outwardly becoming (i.e., having been or having come
from) white in the center and yellow at the outer edge of the
white haze as it expands, and then your body is broken and you
are suddenly free, and you can go one of two places. In this time,
I am golden light. I saw the goldness initially outside of myself.
I ... It was internal to me. It is the reverse of what we normally
do. It is not me out here observing inside; rather I am seeing my
(own) inside (i.e., body interior) from this shell (i.e. body form or
structure as a transparent edging of the body shape) that is clear
(and) that disappeared at the point of the breakthrough ... I saw
the crystal-clear form of me. It is the ghost image I referred to
earlier (in the hypnotic session), but it is clear."
Carlos feels somehow that this process of transmuting his body
into light is related to "the process of creating (a) changing (operation) and hiding (or making invisible) the spacecraft." Earlier
he had described the process of "when I turn into the light" as "an
incredible pain as my body changed, and it feels like the body is
swelling and becoming so swollen and hard that it breaks; I was
frightened by this process ... My body just felt as if it puffed out.
Then the swelling breaks and you are now the light." Once he had
become light the experience was ''joyous and blissful." Before becoming physical or embodied once again, however, "as light I
was dancing in this big circular space first alone, then with the
creatures who were similarly transformed. It was just joyous and
I was so happy. It felt miraculous to be this light and to do this
moving, dancing, and sharing . . . to share this incarnational joy
with the creatures, my companions." This was celebratory in one
sense, but Carlos also believes it is an aspect of the teaching process involved, that the activity is metaphorically experiential.
Carlos indicated that this mechanism of essential empathic identification with the other is inherent to his or anyone's creative capacity, that his artistry re-creates the metaphorically experiential
process as artistic image making. He made distinctions, however,
in the depths of the artistry involved, that this depth or comprehension of the creativity as content or meaning is a human
component of degrees of understanding.
At this point Carlos experienced himself as gold light and associated the energy that produced the transformation with the "hollow black open ' hallway' floor which surrounds the crystal
structures on the platform in the middle of the rotunda. The floor
is open and hollow; the blackness comes from its depth; sort of;
it is a place of movements, from within it, an energy or movement
comes upward to where I 'stand' or float on it and it is like air,
but it isn't a cold shaft of air or anything ... it, like, ionizes me.
I mean it is like an electrical fabrication all through the outside of
my body, and within the heat inside the generating crystal structure within the circular floor space is the core of light. Whew ! I
finally got it out!," i.e., expressing the process, although Carlos
said he realized he expressed it awkwardly.
After reading the above transcript, Carlos commented, "I believe human beings avoid acknowledging 'material' such as art or
'experiences' that are manifest with meaning, and , that for those
who do apprehend these possibilities, there is a tendency to become caught up with an interpretative agenda, instead of listening
to the depth ... The experiences are verbally difficult to describe;
they are more metaphorically imaged" Also he has, he said, so
many images coming through his perceptual/memory/image process that frequently only a word or brief phrase will refer to the
activity and then, at that moment of attempting to verbally refer
to the imagery, he is, simultaneously, trying to hold on to another
set of images experienced, while speaking any kind of even remotely close descriptive word in order to connect with it later.
"Sometimes, there are not words there for the experience ...
Speaking in hypnosis is not unlike writing in a dream diary in the
midcpe of the night when a dream provokes one to wake up m<r
mentarily. One awakens and the residue but illusive imagery is in
the mind, so one jots down a word or two hoping there is enough
to empower one in the morning to bring more of the memory to
the conscious mind."
During our second hypnosis session Carlos had sensations of
anal probing in the examinations which might not have occurred
during this abduction encounter and may have been recalled from
other times. ''They are clarifying that the inside of me is okay, and
they are operating on me, i.e., examining me organwise, muscularwise, et cetera . . . If there is anything not right, the process can
be healing (sometimes, but not always)." He experienced probing;
radiating light "looking at" his heart, ribs, and other parts of his
body; "checking my physical well-being"; and "checking to make
sure I have the constitution to continue.
''They do a light scan. It's with the rose-pink light, again ...
different colors do different things." The instrument itself seemed
to metamorphose into light. "The light went into my body,"
Carlos continued. "You see, they go in, and it is like an instrument, but it dissolves like I dissolved, and that is part of the process here, the metamorphosis; they can cause the change with
their laserlike instruments ... In my heart," he said, "I feel an extreme heat; I think it is healing something. Clearing arteries or
something."
Sometimes, Carlos said, they can enter "through my soles, of
my feet." Other times the invasive body checking is in body openings. The anal probe, for example, creates an "itchy" sensation
that extends throughout his body during the instrumentation. The
itchiness seems related to the absorption of the light energy. He
suggested, "It's light matter, but it may take some sort of more
solid form than we know. And it does what it needs to do to know
my development, in terms of instruments that are different from
our own, but we see them as needles ... well, it is not painful (in
this procedure) unless we fear; it is almost erotic in a total body
sense." (He is referring to the entire process, not just to the anal
sensations. But ... )"When they're in here (the anus) I am feeling
the radiation going out in circular directions from the inside of my
anus to wherever it goes--down the legs, down to the feet, up
through here [gestures up the torso] . . . it is like the whole rear
end/rump is hot and pulled out or expanded with the heat sensa- tion felt throughout the body. It is itchy; it is itchy on the surface
skin on the exterior of the body because it is being pushed out
similar to when I break through the skin (in some of the other
processes and procedures of metaphoric experience) . The radiation
is from the anal, probe but I'm feeling the energy all over. I mean
it has that orgasmic quality, like breathing is orgasmic and erotic,
but it's not the big one, the cosmic orgasm when I manifest as
light-space and energy. You know, it is itchy and there is energy
there, and it is erotic because it is body."
After such probings or other types of examinations Carlos suggested that sometimes there might be physical manifestations or
health symptoms that are not intended by the creatures, that are
realized after the abduction experience; he� believes there is an
irony involved with healing, the process and instrumentation of
which leaves other symptomatic annoyances, such as scars, warts,
bruises, lumps, rashes, on the body.
Despite the distress involved, Carlos gives himself over to this
process.. "If the creatures need to probe and push and (have me)
ejaculate to understand the continual process of the body, through
its metamorphosis on this earthly physical level, then I know that
and I am a willing subject." He feels that "when my body is given
to the probing mechanisms of the light I am energized; I am reenergized . . . That is not just a healing. If my physical body
changes, i.e., experiences cellular changes, the resulting physical
sensations are understood. Then the healing that is occurring
within me occurs to keep me and enables the teaching to be
given."
When he is in the altered state of consciousness, Carlos seems
to be able to perceive the process of transformation of the creatures themselves into light. "Their bodies go from being the little
white creatures they are to light. But when they become light,
they first become cores of light, like molten light. The appearance
(of the core of light) is one of solidity. They change colors and a
haze is projected around the (interior core which is centralized;
surrounding this core in an immediate environment is a denser,
tighter) haze (than its outer peripheries). The eyes are the last to
go (as one perceives the process of the creatures disappearing into
the light), and then they just kind of disappear or are absorbed
into this." He says that they, like himself, and all humans, who he
infers to be of a light-energy source, "are light creatures" but "biologically different from us ... We are or exist through our flesh,
and they are or exist through whatever it is they are."
There are times when Carlos feels that he is himself alien in the
sense of feeling isolated and also identified as an alien being, existing on "more than one level of consciousness," perceived as
different, "a hybridization." He and they are "go-betweens between the knowledge source of being in the universe" and the beings on Earth. His and their transmutations are somehow
connected. During the encounter and even separate from them he
may experience himself in the head or "helmet" of the perhaps
reptilian or other alien creatures. "I feel like I'm looking out
through its 'helmet' (or if the helmet is a reptilian head structure,
its biotic skull) ... It's not a helmet really." He persists in using
this word for something "they put on." Carlos adds that he believes there is a comparative structure in the biorobotic creatures'
head construction and in the helmets worn by the others. He
thinks the functions of both are similar.In his first hypnosis session with Dr. Ward, he felt they might
have masks or screens that augment their vision, which may be
relevant to the helmet as a mechanism and an aspect of uniform
apparel. ' 'The helmet they wear helps them to see various aspects,
such as disease progressions, forms or manifestations of oxidation,
concourses of chemical atomization, temperatures, radium exposure, internal organs, et cetera." When he experienced being given
the opportunity to have the helmet on or at least to examine it, "I
looked through it, and I saw with the robotic or alien quality. I
feel what I observe is recorded. Looking out from its interior, the
eyes of the helmet-mask bulge out." The helmet was "the same
shape (as the aliens' heads, and the eye bulge parallels their own
facial structures), so when we observe these we get real scared because they' re weird looking ... We can see double eyes, dark
eyes , observing them with these on from outside the helmet, although we may not be aware that they are wearing these. The real
eyes of the creature and the reflective helmet or mask 'eyes' are
seen simultaneously and this can be disconcerting."
From inside the robotic "head" Carlos feels he can see temperature and other biological processes. "It is not unlike what we do
with computers and electrical generators. When I am a creature"
or "in the creature's examination 'structure' (it's not a uniform or
costume exactly) I'm studying too."
"Studying what?" I asked.
"Humans," he replied. "I' ve been waiting fifty years to say
this, you know ... What our little television computer machines
do here on Earth is similar to what happens inside these helmets.
There are mechanisms on the inner brow. When it sticks out on
the lower brow above the eyes, inside are mechanisms, the means
to altering what enables the various manners of seeing. It is just
like looking into machinery that is a human form . . . it is like
looking into the workings of a microchip in a computer or other
electrical operations. And there are lots of microchip connectors
on both sides of the brow. Inside the helmet is full of these. I'm
not sure how they function, but when I'm in them ... [he hesitates, then adds] I'm not going to tell you that, I don't think ...
right now. But I am able to see the heat of the human. I can see
at night. I can see the form, and I can see what I want inside those
who are observed. I can turn them into light ... I mean not turn
them into light, but I can put light in them and look around (i.e.,
the mechanism enables its wearer to project such a light), to assist
with or enable healing." He becomes in some respect, I infer from
this, like the aliens with their large eyes, an examiner or analyst.
"On Earth," Carlos said under hypnosis, "there are times when
blocks of time and ordinary consciousness disappear, and I'm (I
become like) a creature for a while, but of which I am basically
unaware. (Perhaps it is to augment a learning process.)" Carlos
suggested later it is at least a means to identify with another species, perhaps to induce an eventual acceptance of their status and
existence. ''The information or visionary aspects transfer to accessible imagery." Through hypnosis we can infer these lost brief images of time. Perhaps, Carlos suggests, this is related to
"sometime before my life when I went through a stage of being
a creature. I took my time considering if I wanted to humanly
manifest and then I volunteered to come down to Earth." This capacity to achieve an alien perspective, an act of identification, if
not form, is important for Carlos 's art and his capacity as a healer.
From an alien vantage point he can look "out the window (as if
from the balcony on the ship) and survey the land beneath .. .
That's where the summit is coming from! My summit work ... "
At this point in his narrative, Carlos paused reflectively. He
then referred to a collection of thirteen large mountain summitvista mixed media drawings and another set of larger oil paintings
he had been creating, and continues to create, for a huge panoramic work (four sets of thirteen works) for which he plans to design and construct a building that will be a place of meditation,
prayer, and environmental awareness. He also simultaneously has
been working on seven sets of thirteen drawings each, having to
do with the theme Eros and the Mer, which he believes are related
to his Iona experiences as well. Carlos exhibited his first set of
these works in an installation Cloud Meditation Chapel in November 1992, an exhibit moving around to various galleries since
then. This exhibit's name is Lightfall-The Mystical Passage and
features the lona photographs in the entrance area of the exhibition. The number thirteen in numerology and mythology infers
wisdom, he explained-wisdom is the attribute associated with
the goddess, Sophia; Carlos points out that wisdom is needed in
the world now in respect to the human tendency, through greed,
to deconstruct the natural process into human norms. His concern
is for wisdom in action about the earth, other species, and the ecological universe within which the earth and its inhabitants are a
part. To Carlos, the number thirteen also implies an opening, an
irrational number pertinent to the irrationalities (not nonrationalities) of the creative spirit, a means for participatory reception,
rather than being a closed or formal number such as twelve. He
believes there is astronomical-planetary and sun-significance aswell as the number is expressible in religious terms; he reminds us
of the number of the apostles or disciples being twelve plus One.
After enumerating these connections between his alien experience and his art, Carlos continued, ". . . I walked around the interior of the ship and looked out at the vistas from up there. As
an artist I thought my insight or inspiration about the earth as a
form or image of consciousness was from the mountain views,
from climbing the mountains. I'm seeing the absolute vista in all
360 degrees as I walk around it, moving from window to window.
I know that such views for my human counterparts are a spiritual
high; each focus or moment of concentration with such viewing is
a moment of inspiration. The spiritual essence takes visual form,
and everybody feels good when they see the sunset or sunrise;
they are enlivened by the natural world. It can be healing. We ordinarily, so caught up with our activities, just do not take time to
deal with the experience of nature like we might. We acknowledge the phenomenal beauties such as clouds or the sunrise, deer
in the field, fish in the water. But we often impose our force and
will on it, to alter it or to destroy it. But, the change in nature is
an energetic force every morning and every night. That's how I
was healed of the cancer. God, it's all coming together. It is amazing, the integration; do you know?" I asked him about the cancer.
"Well, I every night did watercolors in the changing, shifting light
from daylight into darkness through the sunset, and the light transfused me, marking my physical being. Painting relaxed me, and
the cancer went away. Working with the flowers and soil in the
garden helped as well, similarly."
Whether he is inside a creature's helmet on the ship in Ion(4
or perceiving the earth from a creature's perspective from the
sky, Carlos sees great beauty. "I see the islands rising up. I
see the mists rising, and I see the sun going down over there.
I see the clouds forming. This is such a paradise." He continuecL
"I see myself (now, in the capacity of and) as a little creature, but
I'm observing ... Earth is a garden, and these creatures are gardeners in our sense ... I'm a teacher, and that is the capacity of
communication and process. Art is very real, functioning,
spiritual-and the earth is really in need of art's significance right
now."
DISCUSSION
Neither ·carlos nor I can separate cleanly the dimensions of his
narrative that are metaphoric and mythic from those that occur in,
or are of, our, or any literal, physical world. Perhaps it is suffi- .
cient to begin an interpretation of his experiences by saying that
to him they are powerfully real, and leave as perhaps unanswerable now the question of the domain or universe in which they belong. What or who the alien beings, or as Carlos prefers,
"creatures" or "light-beings," are remains unknown. At the same
time, the profound relationship between them and Carlos lies at
the core of his transformations. "I am a shaman/artist/teacher,"
Carlos said under hypnosis, attributing his evolution to the alien
encounter experiences. "They are teachers," he continued, but the
relationship is in some way reciprocal for "they are also really interested in learning of us." The shaman, he said, "uses techniques
to alter the psyche, and what the shaman is doing is playing with
the emotional discourse between teacher and community, between
shaman and student, between the person who travels and the person who remains or who lives a life here. I teach by emotion and
experience." He believes that teaching and the results of the process imply subtle transformation of the spirit. "Teaching, like creating art in truth, is a spiritual activity."
As a teacher of the arts and theater, Carlos seeks to provide his
students with a powerful, transcendent aesthetic experience that
opens them to the wildness or wilderness and wonder of nature
and ereation. He uses his painting and writing to bring a deeper
awareness of the environment. He also has become politically active in his function as a protector of the earth, and very soon after
returning from Iona, helped start a Green Party in Tennessee,
working on the platform. He wants to convey in his t:nessage "the
plenitude of the being of the earth." Again and again, he connects
the evolution of this earth consciousness to his relationship with
the creatures. "Their function is protection" and "they' re keeping
track of my changes." He strives to overcome for all those he encounters the sense of separateness from the earth, to reconnect
them with it, and to create an appreciation of its fragility. The encounter experience "fills my art with . . . with imagery, gives
meaning to the landscape of the mind's perception of the earth."
Also central to many aspects of Carlos's case, especially his
various transmutations and metamorphoses, is light in all of its energetic displays and manifestations. Again, light is real to Carlos
and also metaphoric, "an apt metaphor," he wrote me later after
our August 1992 sessions, "for both creative energy and spirit
(September 1 6, 1992)." Light for him is inseparable from spirit
and profoundly associated with sexuality on a cosmic level. "My
cosmic orgasm while under hypnosis," he wrote, "was physicaland ecstatically spiritual-light wrestling with my humanity, the
angelic dimension with all of its imagined demonologies wrestling
with my humanity."
Carlos is unusually aware of the relationship of his encounter
experiences to the various dimensions of his personal transformation and spiritual growth. It is worth examining these processes in
some detail.
The traumatic experience of those abduction aspects of an encounter, the helplessness, the probing, and the pain open him to
his "light creatureness" and contribute to opening him to "the
world of the soul . . . The soul is the world. The soul is me," he
says. The pain and trauma seem at times inseparable from the expansion of consciousness that Carlos experiences in relation to his
abduction encounters, especially in his inability to protect his children. He also acknowledges that when he awakens in the night
and has insomnia, he leaves his bed and his wife in order to try
to protect her from the possibility of this intrusion on her sleep
and well-being. However, fear and a feeling of protectiveness are
only some of many feelings the abduction experiences evoke.
One of the most powerful emotions Carlos experiences is a
sense of awe. Toward the end of his first hypnosis session with
me he said, "Awe is fear. Awe is mystery. Awe is ecstasy. When
I use the word 'awe,' this is the substantial piece of being in a
larger (world, universe, movement, energy) ... where exists all
the energy forces that are tension and stress and movement and
energy and electrical components and atomic molecular and all of
that. That is awe ... We have the capability of awe, but we don't
deal with it." A month later he wrote to me, ''To sense that a
predator is imminent is part of the fear, but for me there is a fascination as well that undermines the very predatory nature. The
fascination is that of an awe, felt deeply behind the mysterious
and perhaps ominous presence."
The closeness of death seems to be an intimate part of Carlos 's
life, and themes of death and rebirth are related to his alien experiences beginning in infancy and early childhood when he was
"reborn" into a new body at one year old and reportedly saved
from death by the healing powers of an alien being at age five.
"Our art works [including his own] are full of death," he writes.
"My own life is full of death . My life has been to witness death,
over and over and over." Carlos's intimate connection with a cosmic source that he, like many abductees, calls "Home," has made
him long to die. "I pray for it almost every day," he says, "and
I have as long as I can remember." He loves his physicality, yet
the experience of his embodiment for Carlos · is filled with pain
and loss, including having lost a loved one to murder. He fears
that "I won't be allowed to die" and will "just keep on getting
older and older ... The human experience is loss," he says. "But
there isn't anything material to lose 'cause it is all there. But you
see, the personal loss is too difficult, I have lost so many people
to death in this life that I've loved . . . "
The elaborate examinations by the beings that Carlos (like so
many other experiencers) has experienced have been more than
exploratory. He has the sense that they change the "energy
structure" of his body. "It is an operation, but the operation is simultaneously an exam of what I am as a muscular-flesh-bonestructure human being. They know there is a component here that
is a whole organism. The whole organism is a receptacle, as a
sensory modality . . . it is like we are a machine but we are not
of course. We are a bio-real substance that has sensory modalities
enabling perception and memory which chart a history in us. One
of my functions in this is that I am checked, and sometimes
healed, and I am connected to my environment which includes all
creatures." What is done to him, Carlos feels, is to preserve his
body's stability and integrity, "a renewal," to enable him to be a
teacher, while also becoming a kind of alien/human hybrid in the
process.
Carlos's speech under hypnosis is not, to me as a researcher
and hypnotherapist, always altogether coherent when he describes
these complex processes. As stated above he ascribes this to an
onslaught of images and thoughts coming almost simultaneously.
As he begins to describe one, he is "caught by another." He may
have articulated only a word or phrase when another word or
phrase connecting to another thought or image comes out; and he
may grab at particular words in order to describe something but
they may not emerge as being entirely descriptive. "It is like writing shorthand, using a word as a connector and as a symbol, as
a marker, to relate to later," Carlos says.
For example, I heard the following on our tape of a session,
"I'm examined, and the examining ... and the beatings . . . are
pushing and probing of the discovery of my changes in the molecular body. Metamorphoses ... diffusion . . . is the process that I
have to undergo mentally/physically ... in the fleshness ... of a
physical being, in order for the directions we're taking to go
through ... the processes ... as natural ... and not dissolve into
an unnatural process that is too rational or too nonrational, or too
irrational ... "For Carlos, the irrational component in one's psyche is referential to the creative process and the spiritual dimension of a human
being; rationality and nonrationality are terms, that when used together, imply a dualistic or polar mechanism in verbal discourse.
He abridges his commentary parenthetically to confer a fuller implication of his speaking. "When I'm cut apart (i.e., cut open, as
in a cut made during an examination), or probed, or stuck into,"
Carlos says, "it is (sometimes) an intensification of the healing
processes in me. But it (i.e., my body) has to be examined on the
basis of each stage of my being there (i.e., my physicality in its
evolution and development) , being here (i.e. , implying the
changes from experiences), in order for the process to maintain its
sense of completion and change ... because the metamorphosis is
a continual change, and there will never be a stasis in this realm.
Every time. there is a contact there is an alteration."
Carlos, in turn, feels that his openness is a method of teaching
and communication, that his "openness is both an example (as a
means to communication) and (operates in the process of communication) by ... like (the process of) . . . osmosis. And, in a parallel sense to the contact with the creatures, I'm (also) continually
pushing and probing and teaching and changing everybody I (am
or come) in contact (with) (through shared experiences, art processes, et cetera) the same as I am affected by each person in each
situation." In his art he is "practicing" and "reinforcing the metamorphosis" because he believes that his "art is both a way of exploration and sharing, an external form which manifests from the
creative process as it operates through" him.
At their core Carlos's encounters have brought about a profound spiritual opening, bringing him in contact with a divine
light or energy, what he calls "Home," which is the source of his
personal healing and transformational powers. In our sessions,
when he comes close to this light he becomes overwhelmed with
emotions of awe and a longing to merge with the energy/light/
being. Space and time dissolve, and he experiences himself as
pure energy and light or consciousness in an endlessness of eternity, "a pure soul experience . . . I go back to the source because
I'm not just human. I need to go back to the source in order to
continue."
Carlos, like so many abductees, has developed an acute ecological consciousness. He is deeply concerned with the earth and its
fate. The question of whether this is an unintended by-product of
a process that he, no more than any of us, can fathom, or is an integral part of the alien abduction phenomenon, cannot, of course,
be answered. Carlos clearly believes that the aliens, however awkward, or even brutal, their methods, are trying to arrest our destructive behavior. "They're species gatherers. It is not just human
species, animal species. If I feel a cruelty in the (use of their machines, their robots), they know as well that our cruelties, our
willingness (i.e., the imposition of our will), our limits-are self-r
destructive and therefore destructive to all sorts of things." The
earth and the systems with which it is connected are in danger of
"collapsing." The aliens "are like little tiny_ drones of a vaster
complexity" which is "in the service of survival." They are "Earth
gardeners," he says, "trying really hard to instruct us to find a
plenitude and not to be caught in the human impulses towards extinction." They want us to find a "plenitude in the environment,
a plenitude of the garden Earth."
Carlos's case opens us to unfathomable mysteries. Yet there are
hints of meaning, of patterns that we might begin to grasp. During
our first relaxation session he said, "If we explode, then this garden of paradise, even with its predatory nature, this strange, beautiful little ball in the universe ... if it goes, then there is a loss for
everything because it is one means of being that is a comprehension of the unities of things." The earth, he feels is "essential" to
this unity for the universe, "I do not know if there are others like
it" He feels we are confronting "an apocalyptic final hour" and
this must be "met and challenged ... We experiencers of this spiritual apocalypse constitute a paradigm of initiation," he wrote to
me. "We are being initiated, but we initiate."
Among the "lessons" he has learned in his abduction experiences is the need for human beings to expand the scope of their
empathy, to identify more widely. "If human beings were empathic and learn to identify with that which is not themselves, then
they will be less predatory and destructive." For this to occur it
may be necessary for us to gain a sense of where we belong in
the universal order. The breadth and depth of Carlos's perspective
derives from his alien connections and even his experiences of
seeing through alien eyes. "The last image in my hypnotic time
with you," he wrote, "garnered by my immediate memory as we
talked aftetwards, was of my standing, as a small white creature
with my own large luminous blue eyes, on the balcony circling
the interior in the over-craft. I was looking out the window as I
walked around the circular space, and I was seeing this beautiful
paradise, Earth, in every direction."
Interestingly, Carlos compares near-death experiences, which he
has also had, to the alien abduction phenomenon, which he re-gards as having far more transformative power. Through the alien
encounters there is "access to the bliss, and the near death experience is ... a momentary place in between. It is a soul place, to
gather up." Physical and emotional healing, with which the aliens
seem intimately concerned, is an important part of this transformation. "You are diseased and then you are healed. With each
healing, the emotional growth is established and connected in the
human realm and I can go and utilize that towards teaching others."·

CHAPTER FIFTEEN. ARTHUR: A VOLUNTARY ABDUCTEE

Arthur called me in January 1993 at the suggestion of a woman to
whom he had spoken about a dramatic UFO sighting at age nine
which had been experienced by other members of his family as
well. She was familiar with my work with abductees, and Arthur
was curious to explore the incident further. Arthur was thirty-eight
when he called me, a highly successful young businessman with
beautiful homes on both coasts, deeply committed to the democratization of capitalism, creating a sustainable environment, and
protecting the future of the planet. He and other members of his
family attribute his remarkable degree of social and ecological
awareness and sense of responsibility to the profound and lasting
effect of his experience at nine years old.
I have selected his case, the investigation of which has only just
begun, to conclude the series, because I believe it offers a positive
example among the possible human futures that lie before us. To
a large degree it is our collective behaviors, as expressed through
institutions, that i mpact the earth's ecology most profoundly.
Among these institutions, for-profit business corporations, which
impact every part of the globe, are perhaps the most powerful
agents of planetary destruction that human beings have created.
On the other hand, corporations administered mindfully, with an
enlightened awareness of their relationship to the earth's environment, may help to arrest devastation and become one of the most
important instruments available to us for restoring and preserving
the health of the planet.If, as Arthur believes, his alien encounters were instrumental in
the evolution of his sense of personal and corporate responsibility,
he and others like him have much to teach us about what purpose
may lie at the core of the abduction phenomenon. Our contact
with Arthur, who travels a great deal in connection with his work,
has been limited to an initial interview, one hypnosis session, and
a few telephone calls. He was able to attend one support group
meeting several days after the session.
Arthur is the fifth of six children of a prominent, conservative,
Roman Catholic, East Coast fami ly that includes many successful
judges, lawyers, and businessmen. His father was a successful attorney and his mother a real estate mogul. He has a very large extended family which he describes as quite traditional and also
"extremely close." He and his siblings were raised as "spoiled
rich kids," Arthur says, and there were maids and servants to attend to most of his basic needs. He suggests that some of his values may have come from those who worked in the household
"who were just really good people." Arthur has spent much of his
life on a huge rural estate that his family has owned for over a
hundred years. The incident from when he was nine years old
took place near the estate. He recalls no traumatic incidents of any
kind in the bucolic setting in which he spent his childhood.
Arthur grew up with a passionate love of nature and spent a
great deal of time in the woods and fishing in and around the family estate. For as long as he can remember he has had a special
relationship to animals. Whereas his grandfather and greatgrandfather would shoot and stuff animals, Arthur, like a kind of
contemporary St. Francis, says he would communicate with animals, including porcupines, skunks, woodchucks, rabbits, and
birds. To illustrate this he told us a story that took place on his exwife's farm. She had many rabbits on the farm and they trained
the rabbits to be affectionate by lying down on the ground "with
your chin on the floor"; at that height the rabbits would not be
afraid of a human being. Then they would be "incredibly quiet,"
and the rabbits would grow curious, come closer, and "let you
scratch their heads."
Rabbits, Arthur said, have a muscle behind their ears which
they cannot reach to clean or massage but which gets tired. "So
if you just put this finger between the ear and this one on the outside, and you go like this [demonstrates in the air the scratching/
rubbing movement] eventually they just get so trusting they put
their chin on the ground and it's a state of zuz, a way to describe
this." In this "euphoria," Arthur said, the rabbits will lick your
nose, and if you continue to "zuz" their heads they ')ust get totally zuzzed and it creates that bond."
Arthur told this story in the first half hour of our time with him
as a kind of analogy to illustrate how. to communicate with alien
beings. ''The way you communicate with these beings is telepathically, but the only way that you can achieve that telepathy is by
eliminating � fear. That fear will block it. You won't be able to
communicate with them until you can get rid of the fear'' and
other "negative emotion ... If you feel negatively, if it is fear or
anger or destructiveness, or anything like that, they don't communicate that way ... They simply want to be communicated with
by not being feared, and that is the kind of reason they have a difficulty with humans."
The beings, Arthur believes, are trying to induce "that kind of
euphoria." Perhaps "the light does it," but one way or another
"they can induce that." They "are speaking a different language,"
but "if you react with fear, negatively, they just can't. But if you
don't react with fear, you can communicate with them and the
communication is in itself incredibly inspiring. I don't know how
to describe it, but I know, at least my family thinks that it has affected my life in the way that I treat society and my commitments
to different causes and stuff." Arthur can also "zuz" fish, he said.
"I know how to zuz a trout out of a stream." Rabbits and other
animals think "in as profound a way as we think" in their own
way, he said. "You know it is beautiful in its own sense because
it is so trusting, and there is a tremendous amount of love and
trust and affection. It is just basic. There is a life energy there."
During his childhood Arthur tended, like many abductees, to
get significant throat and sinus infections. He also read a great
deal, and even in the third, fourth, and fifth grades remembers liking to get "into debates" with his teachers "about religion and
things like that."
Arthur has created many successful companies whose total
worth he estimates to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Each
one, he says, has funded specific philanthropies. For example, Arthur and his ex-wife put most of the profits from a snack food
company they sold for fifteen million dollars into buying a piece
of land for a migratory ptlfk and put the rest of the money into environmental awareness and similar programs. Currently he is
working with several hundred U.S. corporations to license them to
use special technologies under the condition they give their royalties to particular foundations.
"Anybody can set up a company and make millions of dollars,"Arthur said. The challenge is "to figure out how to employ that
to a higher goal of affecting other people by having your company
be a model, its products being models." The results then are much
more rewarding, he said. "People are motivated by more than just
money," Arthur observed. His ex-wife puts environmental messages on her packaging of various products and they receive thousands of appreciative letters from consumers. She tries to give
handwritten answers to each one. But although this may be worthwhile, "it is selfish," he says, "because you get more out of it than
what you are putting into it."
An article in a New England newspaper in March 1993 described in detail the creative business activities of Arthur and his
ex-wife. The article told of imaginative recycling schemes, including a recycling program for the homeless, a new conversational
packaging technology Arthur had conceived, and "little essays"
about the environment on the packages. The article contained a
quote from Arthur's mother-in-law who calls him "indefatigable"
and "the sort of individual you wind up begging to take your
money and put it into his pocket." In our most recent contact with
him in August 1993 (he called to "check in" and ask when ,, the
next support group meeting would be) Arthur told Pam that he
had licensed his new packaging technology to several major food
store chains. He said he has '-'lots of projects that are in good
shape," including neighborhood gardens, a project for "more democratic capitalism," and a "women's discovery foundation" he is
funding out of the profits from selling the new packaging technology.
Arthur believes that homelessness and environmental destruction are critical issues. To understand what it was like to be
homeless, he lived on the street for a while as a homeless person.
Ozone depletion and out-of-control population growth are to him
two "primary" threats to the earth's ecology. Out of his own
pocket Arthur has been funding "trim tab" pieces of legislation
that might constructively impact the environment "on a worldwide basis." He also makes "a tremendous commitment of time
dealing with politicians whom I am not crazy about" on these issues. He has worked tirelessly to put environmental and human
rights considerations and standards into important international
trade treaties and agreements as well.
A year ago, Arthur said, he knew little about the federal government or the world trade system, "but something made this a
priority, and I have committed an incredible amount of time and
money to just help influence everything from congressional elec-
tions to getting groups that are usually contentious or adversarial
at best, like the unions and [a leading industrial organization], to
get together ... I don't even know them. These are total strangers.
And I don't even know why. I know that [this] will make
sense, and I know it is a necessary thing to have to do it, but it
is, like, okay, this is just like what I am doing."
Arthur says that he is "totally in love" with his ex-wife, Alice,
still, and she remains "my best friend." They separated without
contention because she wanted to live on a farm and "I just can't
live on a farm ... I think that the way you love somebody," he
said, "is to do everything you can to help them fulfill their potential, and to be as happy and healthy as they can, and when they
are happier and healthier that is just going to generate more love
back." One of Arthur's former girlfriends and Alice, he said, are
deeply close to each other and concerned for each other's feelings.
''That is kind of the way for most of the people who I am close
to in my life, male and female and just friends."
From the time Arthur was a small boy and continuing into his
teenage years, he says he would sometimes lose periods of time
and come home late. He knew the thousands of acres of the family estate very well. Nevertheless, he would sometimes find that
the hour was later than it should be and discover himself facing
in a different direction than he expected. On one occasion, when
he was perhaps six or seven, he reported seeing what he took to
be the lights of the manor house through the trees, but realized
that he was a quarter of a mile away, the lights were "two white
lights like headlights, but they were farther spaced and they were
like halfway up or midway up the tree." He was confused as to
his direction ("somehow I got completely turned around") and "it
was much later because it was dark." In his early teens Arthur recalled at least two episodes of missing time. On one occasion he
was following a deer trail in the forest and ended up "hours later
heading back to where I had just come from." He says that when
he remembered seeing the alien beings duri ng the episode
when he was nine they seemed to him like "old play friends."
The central UFO-related experience of Arthur's life occurred in
the summer of 1967, when he was nine. Although we explored
this episode in detail under hypnosis, Arthur recalled a great deal
consciously in our first meeting. He, his mother, his older sister,
and one or possibly two of his brothers were returning home toward the family estate after seeing a movie in a nearby town. He
figures the movie must have been a comedy "because my parents
never did take us to anything except comedies." His mother wasdriving, Arthur and his sister were in the backseat, and his younger brother and perhaps one older brother were in the front seat.
As they were driving along on a dark country road, his mother
said, "that plane is flying awfully low." Then she said in a worried voice, "that is hot a plane," and made everybody get down in
the car. "I saw her hand come down and kind of push us down
. .. we were wired on candy," he said, and thought, "this was going to be pretty exciting for me at least."
Arthur and his sister were in the well in front of the backseat,
and he reported seeing an object about "a hundred to a hundred
and fifty feet" above the car. "It had lots of different lights, but I
couldn't tell you what colors any specific light was, it was just
different colored lights." The light "was coming in my mother's
window and my window," and Arthur found it peculiar that the
light came down to the ground but seemed to create no shadows.
"All the air was lit up," but Arthur knew the object he had seen
"was the light source ... It was the most incredible light. If there
is such a thing as pure white. Totally pure, and it was everywhere." The feeling in the light was "like swimming and being in
water and having the water being phosphorus." He saw different
lights on the object, "like Christmas tree lights, but there weren't
bulbs." He recalls specifically seeing red, white, and a "pinkish
violet" color.
Arthur 's mother and younger brother were intensely afraid,
while his sister was mystified, but he felt mainly excitement.
'There was absolutely no fear. In fact it was the exact opposite. It was complete euphoria, that is the only way to describe it,
better than the best sex or the best anything you could have, better
than fly-fishing for a week." His sense of the encounter was difficult to describe, "almost completely benevolent." The perspective from which Arthur recalls seeing his family seemed odd to
him, as if the car were a convertible and he could look down on
them into a car without a roof. His mother must have pulled over
because the car was stopped at the side of the road.
As he crouched down in the well Arthur thought to himself
"this is really cool." Then he experienced some sort of thought
communication from the object. These thoughts "were being offered is the best way to describe it." He says he was told "you are
_ going to get more," and "the way you can get more is by not being afraid and by being receptive-a million different things at the
same time. It is so difficult to describe ... There was almost a
sadness that it couldn't be learned, but a gladness that it was being learned." The more receptive he could be, and the less he
would be afraid, "the greater the understanding, the more profound it felt." He could not recall then seeing the beings, but
thought of them as "little playful angels," light beings that had
"features, but not really definite features."
At this moment Arthur began to feel slightly anxious for the
first time in the session, "just a gut feeling." His consciousness
seemed to split away somewhat and he felt "like when I am communicatihg this I am not here and it is like someplace else." Yet
for Arthur it was "not a threatening kind of fear. It's that it's awesome. I can't understand it . . . Big is such a dumb word, but it
is so big ... The subjects" he felt the beings were ''trying to communicate" were "so kind of new and big and just incredibly beautiful, but just massive and not what I am used to. I have a little
mind like this, and they are kind of dumping a lot of water and
it is pouring over the sides, so you are like whoa, you know what
I mean?''
Arthur felt that his anxiety and the mild dissociative experience
he had just had were serving to "slow down the velocity" of the
information that was coming to him. "They [the beings] know
they can overwhelm us," he said, "and the anxiety is the block or
the thing that is in between ... If they blow us away or scare us
to death then they can't communicate actually."
Arthur is not certain how long the car was stopped. It took
about twenty minutes to drive to the manor house from the movie,
which he estimates probably let out at eight-thirty or nine. His
grandmother was waiting for them and would probably have been
upset had they come back more than two hours late, so he estimates that incident involved no more than one or one and a half
hours of elapsed time ("normally we would have stopped for ice
cream"). Arthur does not recall just how the trip home was resumed. No one spoke in the car, and his mother did not ever tell
her mother or her husband about the incident. He found this unusual, because "in my family if you buy the wrong shoe size we ·
talk about it, so that it is incredibly unusual in our family because
we talk about everything."
It seems that no one who was present that night talked of the
incident for twenty-five years until a huge family reunion in the
summer of 1989 in which hundreds of members from the various
sides of Arthur's family gathered to commemorate the hundredth
anniversary of the family estate. During this event Arthur's sister,
Karen, came up to him and asked if he remembered anything
about "that night driving home from the movies." At first he
could not remember anything at all, and she asked then "DoesMom remember any of this?" He could not answer that either, so
Karen "described her perspective of what had happened that
night ... She told me a bit, and then it was like a trigger, like it
set off bits and then my bits set off her bits." According to Arthur,
Karen told him that "an incredible light filled the car" and their
mother was very scared. Other details conformed to Arthur's ac- ··
count given above. Karen, he says, "remembers angels. She has a
thing for angels."
Pam spoke with Karen on the telephone four weeks after our
initial meeting with Arthur. Her account is similar to his, except
that she remembers the light as "bluish white." As Arthur had
said, its brightness made it possible to see the inside of the car "as
plain as day." Karen's reaction was one of amazement, and she is
open to the possibility of alien abduction experiences but does not
recall further details herself. Unlike Arthur she does not find it remarkable that their mother did not talk of the incident. If she
"doesn't understand something, she just doesn't talk about it." Karen attributes the forgetting of the incident more to "neglect" than
fear.
Once the memories of this incident had come back to him, Arthur became interested in asking his mother and brothers what
they remembered. At a dinner out, in the spring of 1990, when his
two oldest brothers, their wives, Karen, his girlfriend, his mother,
and his younger brother were present, Arthur asked his mother
about the 1964 incident. She said she saw a cigar-shaped vehicle,
"like a dirigible," with "lots of different lights" that was going at
the same speed as the car. S he was "scared to death," though
"mostly for us-my mother is pretty much that way." She remembered pulling over and trying to get the children down below the
seats . Arthur 's younger brother's memory was similar to his
mother's. He too was very scared, remembered the light and "being stuffed down" in front of his seat. The two other brothers did
not recall the incident and may not have been present.
Arthur had met Donna, the girlfriend who was present at the
family dinner, soon after the summer family reunion. She told him
of an incident from her childhood· when she saw an "angel" on
her windowsill and that she continues to communicate with angels. She told him that all her life she had dreamed of meeting
someone like him. After this, he told her of his experiences and
she encouraged him to explore them more fully and encouraged
him to contact me. Donna also believes that Arthur's involvement
"in all these different projects and such and causes" is related to
his UFO experience. Donna "and my sister have been the two
people to say that I am the one who has to find this out because
they think it has affected my life the most, and, you know, I am
curious if I would have been a different person without it." Arthur
has the sense, related to information he received during his UFO
experience at age nine, that there is "something that I am supposed to communicate, but I don't know what the message is ...
The nine-year-old experience is the trigger or the key to something else . . . something that is important for other people. And
it is simple and elemental, and it is like in me but I don't know
how to communicate it."
The regression was scheduled for March 25 to fit Arthur's
travel schedule. After our last meeting Arthur had talked with
Ted, the brother who had not been at the dinner in the spring of
1990. Although Ted could not recall whether he was in the car at
the time of the 1964 incident, he was "one hundred percent convinced that there was something significant there." Ted is inclined
to think that he was there, "simply because he's such a tradition1 ally conservative Republican person and wouldn't normally believe in UFOs or anything, but he's absolutely convinced they
exist."
Arthur told a strange story of photographs that his greatgrandfather, who was one of the early photographers in this country, had taken of "elves and little people," with chins "pointier''
than humans ', set in rock formations. Arthur suggested that they
were probably little clay models that his great-grandfather, who
was a creative inventor, placed in these formations and then photographed. B ut what is less clear is the source of his ancestor 's inspiration for this activity. Perhaps, Arthur suggested, his own
imagination had made some sort of connection with the little people he had seen in his great-grandfather's photographs. In any
event, the photographs left him with the impression that "I met
little people." Ted is also ''just so convinced that these people exist. For him to agree to that is like getting Richard Nixon to do
it." Before beginning the regression Arthur reiterated his conviction that "there's some message I'm supposed to get."
At the beginning of the relaxation session I set the stage by taking Arthur back to the night of the incident when he was nine and
asked him to report any feelings, images, or bodily sensations that
occurred. The movie, he now reported, was The Mouse That
Roared, with Peter Sellers, "and I think we ate a lot of junk, like
popcorn and stuff." He also reported once more who was in the
car and what his mother was wearing. She said something like
"there's a plane flying awfully low," but soon in "a nervousvoice" she sai<L •'that's not a plane." The large craft had lights
that "went across like a T almost, but they fanned out on the
back." Arthur saw "red and green and yellow." His mother put
her hand behind her seat and told the children "to get down on the
ground," but "I remember thinking that was so cool, whatever it
was." The craft came from behind the car to the left, "out of nowhere," and "just plopped down right on top of us," perhaps fifty
or a hundred feet above, and seemed to fill "the whole sky."
With conscious recall Arthur had not been able to make out details of an actual vehicle, but now he described something like
ribs, a hatch, and seams, and the vehicle seemed to be made of a
"really shiny, light metal, like metal when it's superheated." It appeared as if "the thing itself was lit, was the source" and, in addition, had little points of light. Again, Arthur said, this was "the
coolest thing I' ve· ever seen ... I was ready to go," he said, and
"I wasn't going to stay behind the seat, for sure." The light from
the craft flooded the car and the air around it, and it seemed as if
"the car was in water." The light was everywhere, and there were
no shadows.
Arthur said he could see his mother, brother, and sister, who
"were like crumpled down" in front of their seats. Although he
could see his younger brother, Peter, below the front seat, Arthur
did not see another boy in the car, which made him doubt there
was anyone else in it. Next he described the car being off the road
on the ground, but he still could not recall a moment when his
mother pulled off. He could see nothing then except the light, and
had the sense of the car being below him and the "feeling of being lifted." I sensed in Arthur a tightening or tension, and his critical mind beginning to work harder. I encouraged him to stay as
much as possible with his sensations and raw images without
judgment or trying to figure things out. There is a moment in the
session I cannot pinpoint, when he seemed moved virtually to
tears as he realized the car was no longer on the road and he was
in unfamiliar surroundings.
Arthur experienced "many different feelings," including being
"scared," but "something was telling me not to be afraid the
whole time." As "incredible" as it seemed to him, Arthur had the
sensation that he was being lifted up above the car "and I couldn't
talk to anybody," for they were "huddled" safely in the car and he
knew "they couldn't hear me." Then and now he felt "just confusion ... It was like all the cells in my body were moving up, but
my body was staying where it was, and it was separating." This
feeling of not being "even part of my body anymore" seemed to
be the source of Arthur's fear. He could see his mother and
brother in the car, but he could no longer see his sister in it. But
his perspective was as if "on top of the car" and looking down
through its roof. Still confused, he believes that somehow he went
"through the roof' of the car, but "I can't remember how I got
through there."
Then a "message" came to Arthur, "like they' re concerned"
and "they don't want to hurt me ... They can tell I'm afraid," and
this communication "definitely helps" to calm him. Then (the
source of the communication is not clear at this point) "they're
trying to tell me there's a thread, like a spider thread, and that it's
between us, but it's really fragile ... 'Don't be afraid, or it will
break the thread,' " he was told. I asked if this were a literal,
physical thread or a metaphor for some sort of connection. Arthur
could actually see a "light like a thread, a spider's thread that's
lit" in the sky, surrounded by black. Then he reported seeing more
than six "little lighted beings clustered all together'' who were
telling him not to be afraid and not to break the thread with his
fear.
I asked Arthur to describe the beings. They looked "like an em­
. bryo," he said, ''just little gentle things." They were "lumines­
'. cent," and semitransparent, with large heads and small bodies,
"little skinny arms and little fingers. Maybe not five fingers." In
addition, he saw "little legs," smooth faces with "a little mouth,
little noses" and "no hair ... like babies, like embryos," he said
again. The eyes were all black and rounder than ours. The beings
seemed to be "so close to each other they're touching each other,"
Arthur noticed. "They're discrete," but "their arms are always
touching each other ... It's like a bunch of rabbits. They huddle
like rabbits."
I asked Arthur what was holding him in the air and he said it
was "the thread," which he estimated to be perhaps an eighth of
an inch in diameter, "like a kite string, maybe ... It connects me,
but I don't know how it connects to me." The beings seemed
"pretty funny looking," yet ''just cute" in "the way they behave ... They' re like bunnies," he said. ''They don't want to
harm anybody. Bunnies don't want to harm anybody. They want
to play." Although "I could break it if I wanted to," he felt the beings pulling him upwards on the thread, lifting him "into the
room" as if on "a rope or something." The thread was like an arc,
or "half an arch." He went up it along a curve with darkness underneath. "I couldn't have walked up because it was too steep,
and I wasn't walking. I was going up on an angle."
Arthur found himself "in space ... I could see stars, and it was
like this really smooth kind of beveled thing [this was the first explicit statement that he was being drawn toward the craft]. Looked
like a round edge, like if you took a shallow bowl and put it upside down, really shallow bowl." It had the appearance of buffed
stainless steel. The thread or string seemed to be bathed in a light
that was everywhere, and as the beings were telling him "not to
be afraid" Arthur was "just going" along it, "standing erect,"
pulled as if by an unseen force. The string seemed to go into the
craft, "like a phone line or something." Arthur could now see the
beings inside the craft, which I found confusing as he seemed to
be able to see them while he was ascending on the thread. "They
were never down below," he said. "I could see them through the
string," but they were "in a bubble of light, and it is probably in
the steel thing." This may have made sense from his point of
view, but only introduced other problems for me, which I chose
to let pass.
Arthur could not explain exactly how he got into the
spacecraft-"there wasn't any door or anything." Once inside he
found himself in a huge room with a wavy, irregular floor, surrounded by a ring of pink lights. He said the beings were chattering happily and were glad that he was not afraid. "They're like,
you know, old play friends ... Their main thing is that they don't
want to hurt anybody." I was a bit shocked when he said that the
room was as big as Boston's Fenway Park "upside down." The
beings went on "chattering," communicating without voices or
sound, giggling and touching each other, and seemed to want to
play. Arthur felt them touch his face "very gently. It's like you
touch a rabbit ... They touch like my shoulders and my face is
what I remember, with their hands," as if out of "curiosity," and
they move "all around." There was also mind play, "like they
throw fun things at your mind and you throw fun things back." I
asked for an example. "Well, like blobs of color at you," Arthur
said, "and just really pleasant feelings. Just a million different
kinds of pleasant feelings ... It's the way you communicate with
bunnies," he repeated.
All of this playfulness, and the concern that Arthur be relaxed
and unafraid, seemed to have been a preparation for "something
serious" that was to follow. Darker beings wanted him to know
about a "field of life" that he had lost, out in the country where
it is green and there are "leaves and flowers and grass and birds
and fish and everything." But there was a "big blob of darkness
that's gonna fall over it. They want me to experience what it feels
like." This blob is like "a massive water flood, and it's gonna go
over the entire planet and just kill everything." I asked why they
want him to know that. "Because I think they want to help," he
said. "They don't want it to happen-it's so contradictory." I
asked him to allow himself to go deeper into the contradiction.
'They realize we' re not bright. We' re kind of stupid," he said.
The destruction can be avoided, but the only way they can "do
something about it" is "by communicating." At the same time
"they're afraid of making us afraid," for "if they make us afraid
then we' ll be ineffective."
The blob, Arthur said, was like a great "water balloon," black
and huge, that will cover the whole planet and suffocate it. I asked
how this idea was "envisioned" by him. "They want to tell me
something serious," he said and "they tell you by you feeling it."
As he saw the blob he_ felt the fear and the smothering and the
sense that "everything's gonna die." At the end of what seemed
like a kind of staging or demonstration, the beings removed the
blob, having communicated how serious the problem was. I asked
Arthur how such a disturbing message might have affected him as
a nine-year-old boy. He answered rather indirectly that "the most
beautiful thing is between people who can communicate with each
other like you can with these little guys." The blob, he explained,
was caused by our failure to promote life, to rid ourselves of fear,
and to communicate with one another and with nature. The image
had made him feel afraid and sad when it was happening, espe-
! cially as the beings "make you feel so much life, and they show
I you what it [life] is not."
Arthur returned to the thread that had brought him to the ship,
which became for him now a kind of metaphor for communicating and connecting in a loving way, "like we do with rabbits ...
Some people have to go beyond what they think they can do," he
said. The only thing that could kill the "life-energy" was fear and
the blob was its result. I asked him to say more about fear. "It
blocks everything," he said. If we are afraid we cannot communicate with one another, with the beings, or with animals. "We can't
even let life into us at all." I was not clear about the source of fear
and what we were supposed to do about it. To "stop the blob,"
Arthur said, it would be necessary "to just challenge little fears at
a time. That eventually will get bigger'' and "people will get
stronger." Take the risk of empathizing, saying he1lo, being "nice
to everybody," as, for example, with a "tollbooth person or the
waiter," he suggested. "The reward," he asserted, would be "muchbetter than the fear and the risk ... We' re in a losing battle, but
we can turn it around," he said.
I had the sense that we had gone as far as we could along these
lines and asked Arthur if the beings gave him any other information in the ship. He described then another, smaller room with
other, "darker people," like "runts" or "little monks" with robes
and hoods. These beings were "busines'slike" and "not really playful." They felt his neck and behind his ear and pushed a "soft rubber, cold rubber thing" into "the back of my neck." Several of
these beings were behind him and he saw "a couple on the right
side of me farther away." These entities seemed more "ambivalent" Arthur said, "more complicated ... They're doing stuff.
They' re like moving around, and they' re pantomiming. But they
move pretty smoothly, and they're more serious ... It's not like
the bunnies" where it was more playful and "you can take it in."
They too conveyed to him a sense that human beings act destructively and they do not have confidence in our intelligence.
The communication from the darker beings was "more in-
. tense ... It's like a billion, chilli on, infinite amount of things
going when they hit your brain. It just is like incredible overload,
like you can't experience everything at the same time." The message, however, was unequivocal, "Stop fucking around with life,
with the planet ... You guys are total idiots." I asked how this
was conveyed to him. Was it via the instrument in his neck? It
was coming in "behind my right ear, and it hurts, but it doesn't
hurt like a stabbing pain. It hurts like a dull, like somebody's
pushing the edge of a baseball bat, or the tip of a baseball bat
against the back of my ear-not my ear, my head." It was like a
"really big blast of information."
I asked Arthur how this information affected him as a nineyear-old, if it got through. His response reflected his struggle to
assimilate the impact. "It was there, I know, but it, I can, I know
what they mean ... Yeah. I guess it did. I can definitely, it went
from like playful and nice to like, I don't know, like you have to
be serious. You gotta be, this is important. This is serious. But the
feeling is like, like a shock." I asked him to say more about the
shock feeling. It "doesn't hurt," he said. "Just your entire brain,
every cell lights up, or you see you' re in this like infinite plasma
of incredible light particles. It's not like a lightning bolt; it's like
a, but it's a feeling that's communicated."
"What feeling?" I asked.
Like "a roller coaster where you're at the top and they drop
you off and you're free-falling. You know, it's like whoa ... this
is definitely no kidding around."
"They want to make sure you get it," I said.
"Yeah," he said. "It's like they were grabbing your collar and
just saying, slapping you around a little bit but not hurting you,
just to say you gotta do this, and you have to talk to everybody
else. You have to get it across to other people. You have to teach
teachers."
This was the end of the "lesson." Other than the pressure of the
instrument in the back of his neck he described no other intrusive
procedures. He compared the dark people with the lighter ones.
The dark ones had "more intelligence or information," and the
"little people" were "simpler, or just more gentle." But the dark
ones "respected or admired the little people" who were even
"higher up in a way. They were revered more ... "
I asked Arthur if he could describe the faces of the darker beings. "Like deep furrows, brows, eyes but dark eyes, deep-set
eyes, kind of old," he said. They wore hoods and dark robes and
were "squat" in appearance. The communications of the dark beings, he added, were ')ust too oveiWhelming," requiring "a long
time for us to sort out" what they were conveying. So they needed
the little people to "communicate little things at a time."
We were coming to the end of the session and I asked Arthur
if he could describe anything about the return. He could not, and
reported only that his mother was still "hunched down" on the
front seat as he carne back to the car. "She was like frozen." His
brother and sister were now there as well. Arthur does not remember his mother starting the car up, but "I remember us not talking.
We didn't talk, which was, for my family, really weird. We're
pretty gabby. None of us talked the whole way home." He says he
could not remember at that time what had happened to him. They
may have arrived home an hour or an hour and a half late.
Arthur said then that he had had an experience during the summer just past on the family estate. Without knowing quite why, he
had arranged his entire schedule so he could spend two months
there. "I had to go there for another blast." One day while he was
fishing there was, he says, "another blast," and he believes he
may have lost as much as five hours. He slept in a "far room" of
the manor house that night and his. dreams, which he cannot recall, convinced him that he had had another powerful experience,
but we would have to postpone its exploration to another time.
Looking back at what we had done in the session, Arthur said the
impact of his childhood experience left him with the feeling thathe was "part of a puzzle" and had to do what he could "to
stop ... "
Arthur asked to be introduced to other people who were part of
the puzzle "to see if we can create, if the thread" could create a
"synergy." If "several of us get together it's like a hundred," he
said. He agreed to come to the support group four days later. Arthur spoke further of the problem of dosage. The way the beings
communicate, he said, "we can only absorb so much." When "we
get to the threshold of fear" we "resist absorbing it all." I asked
Arthur how he held what he had uncovered today. "It's completely confusing," he said. "Intuitively I believe it," he said, but
"I don't intellectually." He had struggled during the regression
with "the temptation to flip into fear ... The fear is never gone.
It's always there," he said, but (referring to my presence) "it's like
having somebody hold your hand through an operation . . . You
have to overcome" the fear and "not let it take you."
The "blob," he recalled, "was to make you feel" how "overwhelming it can, it's gonna be if we don't-just how important it
is." The task now was "to get those blasts across to everybody
else," he suggested to me.
Pam spoke with Arthur on the telephone on March 31, two
days after he attended the support group. He " was struck by how
much anxiety there was in the group and how little of the sort of
empathy with the aliens that he feels was expressed. He attributed
this in part to the secure and happy childhood he had had. Arthur
felt comfortable with the outcome of the regression and even told
a few friends about it, but he did not tell his sister the details of
it so she would not be "contaminated," i .e., have her credibility as
an independent witness influenced by what he reported. He noted
that her philosophy of life is similar to his and wondered if this
were because she too has had abduction experiences. Since the relaxation session he has felt more convinced than ever of the message he received from the alien beings and more determined than
ever to do what he can to help.

DISCUSSION
The for-profit business corporation is one of the most powerful institutions for getting things done that human beings have invented.
The impact of corporations is felt throughout the planet, affecting
virtually every aspect of its life. Corporations can be agents of
continuing ecological destruction or a potential source of benefit
for human beings and the life of the earth. Arthur is a business
leader of extraordinary vision. His life has become a model of
corporate responsibility (Everett, Mack, and Oresick 1993). On his
own and in partnership with others he has committed his time, energy, and financial resources to preserving the earth's environment. He has done so through activities which range from local
recycling to political efforts at a national and international level
aimed at making sure that the earth's environment will be protected and sustained.
What seems remarkable is that Arthur and members of his family appear to believe that his social and environmental concerns
and vision are intimately related to his childhood UFO abduction
experience. He wonders "if I would have been a different person
without it." Certainly the information that came across to him so
powerfully during the abduction experience, some he had recalled
consciously and uncovered more fully during the hypnosis session, was completely consistent with the unusual life he has led.
Arthur reported that the alien beings communicated information
to him about the danger facing the earth's ecology, the need for
open, loving communication, and the necessity of ridding ourselves of fear in order to most effectively address these concerns.
This message was received so powerfully that it seemed to reach
every cell in Arthur's body. A dark "blob" that smothered the life
of the earth was shown to him as an image of its potential fate.
"Stop screwing around with life, with the planet," he was told.
"Do what you can to stop the destruction and promote the life of
the earth." In addition, his mission would be to be a teacher and
"to teach teachers" to communicate the information that seems to
have been literally "blasted" into his soul during his abduction experience at age nine and perhaps in others. Surely that is how he
has lived his life.
Powerful metaphors run through Arthur's case. The thread that
apparently brought him in an arc from the car to the spacecraft is
also a symbol of loving connection between living beings. Arthur
makes an analogy repeatedly between the way he knows how to
communicate with animals-his "zuzzing" rabbits, for exampleand the open, loving way that it is necessary to relate to the alien
beings. Indeed, he even likens the "little people" he has encountered since childhood to bunnies. The way Arthur seems to have
been able all his life to connect with the spirits of both wild and
domestic animals seems in some way intimately linked with his
fearlessness, as compared to the resistance of other members of
his family who were present during the 1963 incident, in accepting the presence and message of the alien beings.There are other interesting aspects to Arthur's case. His experience at age nine involved two distinct types of beings: light,
somewhat translucent, "little people," who were playful, loving,
and altogether friendly; and darker, more serious entities . that
seemed somewhat like the familiar grays. These two types seemed
to work together in a kind of good cops/bad cops manner, the little people helping Arthur to overcome fear and to develop a joyous, open consciousness, while the darker beings delivered the
powerful, disturbing message. This division seems to be found in
other cases. Typically, children are prepared through manifestly
light, playful, and loving connection with friendly beings for later,
more serious, or even threatening communications and projects
that are carried out by sterner, more determined entities.
Arthur's case is also interesting from a mental health perspective. His childhood seems to have been uniquely secure and free
of trauma or troubled relationships. There is a conspicuous absence . of psychopathology in his history or contemporary mental
state. Indeed, he seems remarkably stable and balanced, while at
the same time highly creative and innovative. It would even appear that it was Arthur 's sense of inner security, a kind of adventurous attitude toward life already in evidence in his fearless
excitement when he said he saw the UFO come down over the car
("this is really cool"), that made him especially suited for the "assignment" that he says he was given by the alien beings.
. Arthur's story, like many abduction cases, raises puzzling questions about the relationship of thought to the physical world, cause
and effect, and the vicissitudes of memory. There is something almost organic about the metaphors that run through his case. The
dark blob he is shown by the beings and the thread or string that
brings him to the UFO seem to exist in a kind of gray area between thought and the physical world. Like waves and particles in
quantum mechanics, they seem to be thoughts in one context and
something physically real in another. They are not simply one or
the other, thought versus something physical, but rather are both
depending upon the context. The blob seems to be something that
really destroys the earth, more "real" than a metaphor, but it is
also an image or symbol, staged by the beings in Arthur's mind,
to bring about a particular effect. The thread brings Arthur physically to the ship, but it is also a powerful symbol of relationship
and connection.
Even the association between the bunnies on .Alice's farm and
the perception of the light beings as "bunnies," or the relationship
between how to "zuz" a bunny or open to an alien, seem to be or-
ganic linkages, closer or more intrinsic somehow than mere analogies. What this may bring us to is the relationship between
thought and the physical world, two domains that have been kept
radically separate in the Western worldview. But in Arthur's case,
thought and physical reality seem inseparable, as if one could give
rise to the other in a generative fashion that we do not understand.
Perhaps consciousness itself represents a kind of creative source,
a ground of being from which both thought and the physical
world ultimately derive.
I also wonder about what is cause and what is effect in Arthur's
abduction experience. Did he have the experience because his
psyche was open to such realities, or did the abduction encounters
themselves, going back perhaps to earliest childhood and possibly
before (we have no "past life" experiences in Arthur's case), bring
about the flexible and visionary state of his mind? It may be that
the very category of cause and effect is too linear and is not useful
in such instances. More appropriate would be a way of thinking
that looked upon Arthur and his experiences as interconnected in
a way that could only be looked upon as a whole.
Finally, Arthur's case raises questions about forgetting and the
triggering of memory similar to what we saw in Ed's experience
(see chapter 3). Why didn't he or anyone present during the 1963
incident seem to remember it or speak of it afterwards? And what
forces, twenty-five years later, led his sister to open up the subject
and thus trigger Arthur's memory and the sequence of events that
brought us together? To what extent do the forces of forgetting
and remembering reside in Arthur's psyche; or are they imposed
from outside by the aliens or whatever source determines their activity? And, like the separation of cause and effect just discussed,
does this dichotomy even apply? These are but a few of the many
questions and mysteries into which cases like Arthur's seem to
lead us.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN. ALIEN INTERVENTION AND HUMAN EVOLUTION

Tibetans tell a story of an old frog who had lived all his life
in a dank well. One day a frog from the sea paid him a visit.
"Where do you come from?" asked the frog in the well.
"From the great ocean," he replied.
"How big is your ocean?"
"It's gigantic."
"You mean about a quarter the size of my well here?"
"Bigger."
"Bigger? You mean half as big?"
"No, even bigger."
"Is it ... as big as this well?"
'There's no comparison."
'That's impossible ! I've got to see this for myself."
They set off together. When the frog from the well saw the
ocean, it was such a shock that his head just exploded into
pieces.
-Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying
When we look back our lives seem to possess a coherence, and
even a progression, of which we were hardly aware as events unfolded. When the UFO abduction phenomenon flrst came to my
attention, my curiosity was aroused, and I had a sense that something unusual was happening within me. But I had little notion of
the extent to which my explorations would open my consciousness to vast mysteries and uncertainties. And I did not foresee
how fundamentally challenged the view of the world in which I
had been raised would be.
Each of the thirteen people whose cases are described in this
book-indeed each of the seventy-six abductees with whom I
have worked-tells a unique story. The injdividual differences can
probably be accounted for on the basis of the diverse personalities
of the experiencers and the varieties of circumstances within the
abductions themselves. But what I have found to be so extraordinary from the beginning of my study has been the readily identifiable patterns that emerge when the case narratives are examined
carefully.
It may be argued that it is my own mind that has created this
coherence, and that I have shaped and interpreted data in line with
a structure that I already have in mind. In response to this criticism, I can only state that the abduction phenomenon was, in the
beginning, as unbelievable to me as it is to any skeptic and that
I have tried to be aware of any inclination to form new beliefs and
convictions that might take the place of previous ones that have
been so radically ·called into question. One of the reasons I chose
to include so many cases in such great detail is my desire to
weave a tapestry of sufficient richness to give readers the opportunity to make their own judgments about the abduction phenomenon. I cannot say that the cases selected have been "typical,"
because I do not know what a typical case would be, or even that
there is such a thing as a typical case. I do believe, however, that
the cases I have discussed are illustrative of the range of phenomena that characterize abduction experiences.
There are aspects of UFO abductions that do not obey the physical laws of the universe as we have known them. Some of the
phenomena might be understood at some future time through great
advances in physics. But others, such as the capacity abductees
like Paul discover to move their consciousness through space and
time, require another ontological paradigm. I do not expect that
the material presented in this book will have much impact on the
minds of those who believe that the laws of physics as encompassed by the Newtonian/Einsteinian system are the full definition
of reality. I hope, however, that the data contained here is of sufficient power and solidity to enable those who are open to expanding their view of possible realities to consider that the world
might contain forces and intelligences of which we have hardly
allowed ourselves to dream.
"When I turn the lights out at night, this has been the show for the
past week. I can see it with my eyes closed as well as open."
-Anne (see page 403)

WAYS OF KNOWING: METHODOLOGY
In physics, psychology, and other fields the data we obtain is a
function of the way we have gone about the task of gaining information. In my own discipline of depth psychology, Freud and his
followers, using their insights into the contents and structure of
the human unconscious gained through the analysis of dreamsquite overlooked in the rationalist neuropsychology of his timederived the application of hypnosis in medical psychology and the
method of free association. The development of new ways of
knowing requires, however, something more than the application
of different technologies or tools. Rather, an expanded epistemology, especially in psychology, may demand the legitimization (or
relegitimization) of neglected aspects of ourselves as instruments
of knowing.
Although psychoanalysis has been responsible for great advances in our knowledge of human experience and the depths and
structure of the psyche, it has retained as a way of knowing a
good deal of the dualistic, subject/object split that characterizes
Western empirical science, including psychology. The patient or
client is generally regarded as someone with a problem, separate
from the therapist/investigator; the patient is to be helped or studied. Indeed, Freud eventually turned away from hypnosis as a way
of working with his patients in part because of the subjective bias
it seemed to introduce into the therapeutic process (Mack 1993)
rather than recognizing the inherent intersubjectivity of psychodynamic clinical work (Stolorow 1992) and continuing to struggle
with the demand for analytic rigor that this requires.
Alternative therapies and investigations of human consciousness
appear to share an expanded use of the psyche as part of the exploratory process. The feelings and spirit of the facilitator in alternative therapeutic situations, as well as his or her rational mind
and observational skills, are a vital aspect of the therapeutic or investigative method. This expanded use of the self relies on empathy and is, in essence, intersubjective. Within this framework
hypnosis, shamanic journeys, meditation, Grof breathwork, vision
quests, and other modalities, which are called in the West
"nonordinary" states of consciousness, become natural investigative allies. For they involve, by definition, the opening of the psyche to the deeper realms that lie behind the rational or observing
mind. In the end, of course, the rational intellect is essential for
understanding and integrating the data obtained through the fuller
use of consciousness as an investigative tool. But along the waywe-as investigators or readers-must open ourselves through
this expanded way of knowing to whatever the patient or subject
may report to be his or her experience.
It is perhaps understandable, therefore, that I would have, in effect, "stumbled" upon the UFO abduction phenomenon and that I
was then more or less prepared to take on its investigation in the
context of my training in the Grof holotropic breathwork method
(see chapter I ), which relies upon the use of the whole selfmind, body, and soul-in the exploration of unconscious human
experience. In working with abductees, the investigative method I
have developed is basically a combination of the old and the new.
In addition to standard interviews I use hypnosis, which was
Freud's original "nonordinary" state for investigating the unconscious, modified by the use of the breath for centering and deepening the process. In my work with abductees I am fully involved,
experiencing and reliving with them the world that they are calling forth from their unconscious. My whole psyche or being is engaged; naturally the rational or observing self is always present,
shaping, limiting, and protecting the process.
The empirical methods of Western science rely primarily on the
physical senses and rational intellect for gaining knowledge, and
downplay feeling and intuition. They were developed in part to
avoid the subjectivity, contaJ.llination, and sheer messiness of human emotion. Yet the cost of this restricted way of knowing may
be that we now learn about the physical world with pnly limited
use of our faculties. In order to learn about the worlds "beyond
the veil," as abductees put it, we may need a different kind of
consciousness. This means that the process of gaining information
about abductions is, to a large degree, participatory, even "cocreative." By this I do not mean that I impose beliefs of my own
about the phenomenon upon the experiencers, am leading or
"coaching" them, or even that I believe literally everything an
abductee says.
As much as possible my questions in the sessions derive from
what has just been said, or my intuition, based on experiences in
therapy not only with abductees, but hundreds of patients, about
where I feel the inner experience of the abductee is going. I avoid
leading questions, and abductees, in my experience, are quite difficult to lead (they all seem to feel, as Sheila said, "I know what
I saw"). Yet, at the same time, I cannot avoid the fact that a cocreative intuitive process such as this may yield information that
is in some sense the product of the intermingling or flowing together of the consciousness of the two (or more) people in the
room. Something may be brought forth that was not there before
in exactly the same form. Stated differently, the information
gained in the sessions is not simply a remembered "item," lifted
out of the experiencer's consciousness like a stone from a kidney.
It may represent instead a developed or evolved perception, enriched by the connection that the experiencer and the investigator
have made.
From a traditional dualistic perspective this might be called
"distortion"; from a transpersonal point of view the experiencer
and I may be participating in an evolution of consciousness.
When we are dealing with a phenomenon like alien abductions,
which manifests in the physical world but may derive from some
other reality, the question of whether hypnosis (or any other
nonordinary modality that can help us access realities outside of
or beyond the physical world) discloses accurately what literally
or factually "happened" may be inappropriate (see Appendix A
for a fuller discussion of this matter). A more useful question
would be whether the investigative method can yield information
that is consistent among experiencers, carries emotional conviction, and appears to enlarge our knowledge of phenomena that are
significant for the lives of the experiencers and the larger culture.
BASIC FINDINGS: A SUMMARY OF WHAT THESE AND OTHER
ABDUCTION CASES TELL US
The experiences of the people whose cases are reported in this
book (and of many other abductees) may be divided into three
categories: physical or physical-like events; the reception of information; and spiritual or transformational phenomena.

PHYSICAL OR PHYSICAL -LIKE EvENTS
I will stress once again that we do not know the source from
which the UFOs or the alien beings come (whether or not, for example, they originate in the physical universe as modern astrophysics has described it). But they manifest in the physical world
and bring about definable consequences in that domain. The great
majority of abductees have had vivid and powerfully meaningful
sightings of UFOs at some time in their lives, although they may
not see the outside of a spacecraft during a particular abduction
experience. In virtually every case there are one or more concrete
physical findings that accompany or follow the abduction experience, such as UFO sightings in the community, burned earth
where UFOs are said to have landed, and independent corroboration that the abductee's whereabouts are unknown at the time of
the reported abduction event. Seemingly unexplained or missing
pregnancies, a variety of minor physical lesions, odd nosebleeds,
and the recovery of tiny objects from the bodies of experiencers
are also widely seen.
Often these findings are subtle and difficult to prove by the
methods of empirical science. They must, therefore, be seen as
secondary evidence in support of what the abductees have reported. The sheer consistency and number of these accompanying
physical findings make them too important to dismiss. The greatest mass of data, however, comes not from the physical findings
but from the reports of the experiencers themselves. Although varied in some respects, these are so densely consistent as to defy
conventional psychiatric explanations.
Abductees may be found to have had virtually lifelong encounters with alien beings and UFOs, although in certain cases, like Ed
and Arthur, a single abduction event has been of particular importance. The abduction experiences begin with a shift in consciousness on the part of the abductee, which may be signaled by a hum
or other odd sound, by the appearance of a light for which ilo
usual source can be found, by the sense .�f a presence or even the
sight of one or more alien beings (as described in chapter 2) or by
a strong vibratory sensation in the body (as in Sheila's "electrical
dreams"). This change in consciousness may be subtle, but
abductees are always sure that they are not dreaming or imagining. Rather they experience that they have moved into another reality, but one that is, nevertheless, altogether real. This is a waking
reality, but a diff erent one. As one abductee described this shift to
me, it is as if the alien beings break through a kind of screen, revealing a new reality to the experiencer.
After this the experiencer is taken by some force, often a beam
of light or some other energy at the disposal of the alien beings,
out of or away from the house or other place he or she has been,
through walls, doors, or closed windows if necessary. Experiencers may see their home and the earth itself recede before them as
they are transported into a spacecraft, which is commonly described as metallic and saucer- or cigar-shaped and which is revealed to be the source of the light that they saw initially. Once
inside the craft the abductees see varying numbers of alien beings
as described ' in chapter 2, who are engaged in a rather businesslike way in preparing to administer various procedures. The inside
of the craft is generally rather cold, emotionally and physically,
sometimes with a musty smell, with computer-like consoles along
the walls. The walls tend to be white and curved, although black
floors are sometimes described.
The procedures have a medical- or surgical-like quality, but the
instruments used do not resemble those with which we are familiar. Gazing, staring and mind scanning, and other telepathic communications of various sorts on the part of the aliens often occur
initially. Abductees tend to feel that the contents pf their minds
are thoroughly revealed to the aliens. After this there are various
procedures administered under the control of a slightly taller and
older-appearing alien, spoken of by the abductees as the doctor or I leader. Although this figure may be resented by the experiencers,
he (the leader is usually, but not always, perceived as male) is of1 ten familiar to them from abductions going back to childhood and
they may feel a strong bond, even intense love toward him, which
they sometimes feel is reciprocated.
The procedures include taking of small tissue samples, probing
of the head (which is usually felt to be related to taking i nformation from the brain, monitoring the state of being of the experi­
. encer, and inserting or removing implants), and the insertion or
1 application of odd instruments into or onto other parts of the body,
I including especially the abdomen, anus, and reproductive organs.
Sperm samples are forcibly taken from men, and women experience the removal of ova; fertilized eggs, which may have been genetically altered, are implanted, and later there is the eventual
removal of the pregnancy. In subsequent abductions, experiencers
are shown hybrid offspring and may even be asked to hold or nurture them. As children, they may have been asked to play with
these odd creatures, who may appear listless by our standards. All
of this is quite terrifying to the experiencers, although the level of
terror is modified by some form of anesthetizing energy that the
aliens are reported to administer with their hands or rod-like instruments. Other sexual and reproductive activities may be
brought about by the aliens, who seem, as will be discussed further later, especially interested in the sexual and emotional aspects
of our lives.
When the experiences are recalled consciously, or during hypnotic sessions, the abductees go through an emotional reliving of
great intensity and power. Otherwise quite controlled individuals
may writhe, perspire, and scream with fear and rage, or cry with
appropriate sadness, as they remember their abduction experiences. This emotional expression appears altogether authentic to
those who are unfamiliar with the abduction phenomenon and wit-
ness it for the first time. For myself, being with abductees who
are going through these experiences requires every bit of holding
energy and caring presence that I can muster. There has not, as
yet, come to my attention in any case an alternative explanation
for the basic elements of the abduction experiences that these individuals are reporting in such overwhelming and vivid detail.
To make our understanding even more difficult, it appears that
the penetration of the abduction phenomenon into the physical
world is not an all-or-nothing matter. In some cases a person is
known to have been missing, can recall, with or without hypnosis,
an abduction experience, and has returned with bodily lesions for
which there seems to be no other explanation. But in other situations, "complete" abduction does not appear to occur. The individual may have an out-of-body experience while others see that he
or she has not left the house. Abductees will also report a great
deal of "activity" that may or may not presage an abduction but
which may occur often, even on a nightly basis. This includes a
sense of the alien presence, disturbing vibratory and other bodily
sensations, odd noises in the house, and many kinds of light phenomena that appear in their minds or in the surrounding environment. All of these elements are clearly, from the experiencers'
point of view, related to the abduction phenomenon.

THE RECEPTION OF INFORMATION
The transmission of information from the alien beings to the experiencers appears to be a fundamental aspect of the abduction
phenomenon. Indeed, for some abductees, including Arthur and,
to a certain degree, Paul and Eva, there is relatively little trauma;
the experiences seem to be primarily informational or transformational in character. Information during abductions appears to
be transmitted in two forms-by direct, mind-to-mind conveyance, or through depiction of phenomena or events on televisionlike screens. As in Catherine's case, an entire conference room
setting was displayed for her benefit in order, apparently, to create
the right conditions for communicating with her about the state of
the earth's living systems.
The information that abductees receive is concerned primarily
with the fate of the earth in the wake of human destructiveness.
Scenes are shown of the planet wasted by nuclear war and especially of the ' earth's environment devastated by pollution and toxic
clouds. Sara and Arthur, for example, were shown great black
clouds or "blobs" suffocating the earth's living systems, the effects
presumably of environmental catastrophe. A number of abductees
have been shown apocalyptic images of the earth itself literally
· cracked open or broken up, followed by elaborate triage scenes in
which ·some people will die, others will survive in some way on
Earth, and still others will be transported to some other place
where human life will continue in a new way.
It is not clear what to make of these images. Although as prophetic visions they may be viewed metaphorically by outsiders,
for the abductees themselves they are experienced with conviction
, as literal and concrete. The visions cause great sadness. In Ed's
case even the spirit beings themselves have been afflicted by human folly and destructiveness. Scott is typical of experiencers
who have received information from the aliens about past destruction of their planet or environment. Now they are seen as trying
to prevent a recurrence.
· Although the alien beings appear to some experiencers to be in­
tervening to alter our consciousness in such a way that our aggres­
sion would be reduced, they seem genuinely puzzled regarding the
degree of our apparently mindless or gratuitous destructiveness.
As they communicated to Paul, they do not understand why we
would set about to destroy a realm of such transcendent beauty,
and they seem in some awkward way determined to stop us from
doing so. Environment, as Sara has said, means much more than
nature or our physical ecology. It refers to the entire context of
life itself. It is, in her words, "the creative, life-affirming" place of
unconditional love. "You are your environment," she said. The
aliens seem to be concerned with our "environment" in this total
sense.

TRANSFORMATIONAL AND SPIRITUAL PHENOMENA
The aliens themselves seem able to change or disguise their form,
and, as noted, may appear initially to the abductees as various
kinds of animals, or even as ordinary human beings, as in Peter's
case. But their shape-shifting abilities extend to their vehicles and
to the environments they present to the abductees, which include,
in this sample, a string of motorcycles (Dave), a forest and conference room (Catherine), images of Jesus in white robes (Jerry),
and a soaring cathedral-like structure with stained glass windows
(Sheila). One young woman, not written about in this book, recalled at age seven seeing a fifteen-foot kangaroo in a park, which
turned out to be a small spacecraft. I heard recently of a case
where a number of children were transported into the sky in asmall craft that appeared to them initially as a booth at a carnival
in which aliens disguised as humans asked if they wanted to go
on a journey. -
Other experiences relate to the expansion of consciousness and
its separation from the body in present time, as in Paul 's ability to
"travel" to the time of the crash of a space vehicle, or even to the
period when dinosaurs were on Earth. The frequency with which
"past life" experiences emerge during the hypnotic sessions relates
also to the idea of expanded identity, i.e., in some sense the human spirit or soul may not be limited to this lifetime but may
have extended over hundreds and even, as in Catherine's case,
thousands of years. "Past life" material becomes particularly powerful when it helps us to perceive, as in Joe's and Dave's cases,
a possible continuity of personal growth over more than one lifetime.
Many of the abductees written about in this book have experienced a dual identity as both a human and alien being. As an alien
they see the world from an alien perspective, and, as in Joe's case,
carry out the alien side of the reproductive enterprise. Peter, on
the other hand, was troubled to discover material about his mating
as a human being with an alien female. The alien self is sometimes perceived as the lost or abandoned soul of the human self,
linked once to a common source. The felt task then becomes one
of integrating the split-off alien self or soul and becoming whole
once again.
Many abduction experiences are unequivocally spiritual, which
usually involves some sort of powerful encounter with, or immersion in, divine light. This phenomenon is pervasive in Carlos's
case and is present in many I have studied. The alien beings, although resented for their intrusive activities, may also be seen as
intermediaries, closer than we are to God or the source of being.
Sometimes, as in Carlos's case, they may even be seen as angels
or analogous to God. A number of abductees with whom I have
worked experience at certain points an opening up to the source
of being in the cosmos, which they often call Home, and from
which they feel they have been brutally cut off in the course of
becoming embodied as a human being. They may weep ecstatically when during our sessions they experience an opening or return to Home. They may, as in Sara's case, rather resent having to
remain on Earth in embodied form, even as they realize that on
Earth they have some sort of mission to assist in bringing about
a change in human consciousness.
Related apparently to this opening to the divine source is the
experience that some abductees have of great cycles of birth, life,
and death, repeating over long stretches of time. This may become
particularly apparent when "past life" experiences are relived and
the abductee is able to enter the experiences of death and rebirth.
A related phenomenon, which I will describe in more detail later, might be called the reification of an archetype or metaphor.
Tubes, passageways, threads, et cetera may be literally seen, or
passed through or along physically, but at the same time they
symbolically represent important transitions from one state of being to another.

THE IMPACT OF ABDUCTION-EXPERIENCES
Most of the individuals discussed in this book have suffered the
multi-dimensional trauma that is associated with abductions-the
helplessness as terrifying intrusive procedures are inflicted on
their bodies, the isolation from family and friends, the inevitable
shock to their worldviews, and, especially, the realization that the
experiences may recur at any time to them or their children.
"We're not relieved of our continuing unrelenting other world
melodram" wrote Jen-Y, whose three children appear to have
been visited.
Yet the abduction phenomenon is not simply traumatic. Experiencers may be left with fears, nightmares, and other sequelae of
severe stress together with small bodily lesions, sinus headaches,
gastrointestinal symptoms, mild neuropathies, and psychosexual
dysfunctions that appear to be related to their abduction encounters. At the same time, however, in my caseload there is evidence
that the alien encounters have been responsible for healing conditions ranging from pneumonias and leukemia to limbs paralyzed
due to muscle atrophy from poliomyelitis. Furthermore, many
abductees seem to gain powers themselves as healers. Although
abductees may continue to resent the abduction experiences and
fear their recurrence, at the same time many in one way or another come to feel that they are participating in a life-creating or
life-changing process that has deep importance and value.
In addition, many abductees, including the cases discussed in
this book, appear to undergo profound personal growth and
transformation. Each appears to come out of his or her experiences concerned about the fate of the earth and the continuation
of human and other life-forms. Virtually all the abductees with
whom I have worked closely have demonstrated a commitment to
changing their relationship to the earth, of living more gently onit or in greater hannony with the other creatures that live here.
Each seems to be devoted to transforming his or her relationships
with other people, to expressing love more openly, and transcending aggressive impulses. Some abductees, like Eva, Peter, Carlos,
and Arthur, wish to use their evolving perspective to influence
others and have become teachers of a new way of living. In addition, abductees seem, especially once they confront and integrate their experiences, to be especially intuitive; they sometimes
demonstrate strong psychic abilities, including clairvoyance or the
ability to perceive at a distance. Further research is needed to document these capabilities.
Virtually every abduction researcher must at some point confront the question of whether these expressions of personal growth
are a consequence of trauma-a stressful confrontation with unknown forces--or are an intrinsic aspect of the phenomenon itself.
After all, it may be argued, victims of war, rape, abuse, and other
traumata may grow emotionally and spiritually simply because
their experiences lead them. to discover new and deeper resources
within themselves.
Comparisons to the "Stockholm syndrome,'' in which victims
of abusive behavior come to identify with the purposes of the
abuser, do not take into account the subtleties of these encounters.
Dr. Judith Herman, a specialist in the effects of chronic trauma on
battered women, political prisoners , and victims of torture
(Herman 1992), cites an inability to recall details of the events as
one of the reactions to coercive control. Herman notes that when
a victim is threatened with violence or. pain, is denied control over
bodily functions, experiences unpredictability in the enforcement
of rules, and receives intermittent rewards, the victim's sense of
personal power is destroyed and the individual comes to feel helpless. Victims of such trauma identify strongly with theif captors,
"voluntarily" choosing to remain with them in the absence of
physical restraint.
·
It is true that abductees may experience terror and some pain
with the examinations performed on them. The aliens' actions are
also in many ways unpredictable, sometimes frightening and
sometimes rewarding. However, in contrast to the narrow and
self-serving purposes of human abusers and political kidnappers,
the beings reveal a shared purpose, and offer the possibility of
openings to an inclusive, more expansive worldview that is powerfully internalized by many abductees.
My own impression, gained from what abductees have told me,
is that consciousness expansion and personal transformation is a
basic aspect of the abduction phenomenon. I have come to this
conclusion from noting in case after case the extent to which the
information reported as having been communicated by alien
beings to experiencers is fundamentally about the need for a
change in human consciousness and our relationship to the earth
and one another. Even the helplessness and loss or surrender of
control which are, at least initially, forced upon the abductees by
the aliens-one of the most traumatic aspects of the
experiences-seem to be in some way "designed" to bring about
a kind of ego death from which spiritual growth and the expansion of consciousness may follow.
But my focus upon growth and transformation might reflect a
bias of mine. The people who choose to come to see me may
know of my interest in such aspects of human psychology, and
may be aware that I consider my work with abductees to be a cocreative process. In some cases-Arthur, for example-the commitment to environmental sustainability and human transfonnation
antedated contact with me.
A word must be said about the strain that the abductees' experiences places upon spouses and other intimates. Such experiences
may dominate their lives, and as Peter and Jerry did, abductees
may require a great deal of support from wives, husbands, and
others, who may feel at the same time that their own needs are
not being met when the experiencers are so preoccupied with
what has happened to them. Furthermore, if those close to an experiencer are not themselves experiencers, they may find the
whole situation difficult to believe, as their sense of reality is being assaulted. They may wish to deny the whole matter despite
strong evidence that something important is happening to their
loved ones.
Or parents, who may themselves be abductees, can become
alienated from their children when they cannot bear what is happening to their offspring; in some instances it is even more painful
for a parent-! have seen several cases where the child experiences an alien being as his or her "true" parent. In some instances,
as in Eva's case, strain in a marital relationship may arise when
the abductee feels that he or she has in some sense outgrown the
spouse, who may be unable or unwilling to follow the abductee
into the expanded realms he or she describes. More work is
needed in supporting family members of abductees who need to
understand and participate in their loved ones' experiences.SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THE ABDUCTION PHENOMENON
As the power of her abduction experiences sank in Sheila said, "It
simply does not make sense in the world as I know it to be."
Faced with this fact Sheila, like each of us, has a choice. We can
continue to try to make the phenomenon fit the world as we have
known it, jamming it into a kind of procrustean bed of consensus
reality. Or we can acknowledge that the world might be other than
we have known it. Then we are free to see where our thinking
leads us. I cannot discourage those who try to discover conventional · explanations for the abduction phenomenon. I would only
point out that as a cli nician, I have spent countless hours trying to
find alternate explanations that would not require the major shift
in my worldview that I have had to face. But as I discussed in
chapter 2, and as I have tried to make clear in the case narratives,
no familiar theory or explanation has come even close to accounting for the basic features of the abduction phenomenon. In short,
it is what it is, though the ultimate source of these experiences remains a mystery.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
Several of the people described in this book were seen by psychologists, psychiatrists, and other physicians who were not familiar with the UFO abduction phenomenon. Scott was subjected
through much of his childhood and adolescence to medical tests
for epilepsy, was given anti-epileptic medication over a period of
years, and was even hospitalized to evaluate and treat his strange
abduction-related symptoms. Sheila was treated in unavailing psychotherapy for many years and evaluated extensively by mental
health professionals who remained doubtful about the reality of
alien abductions and UFOs. This resulted in considerable, and in
my opinion unnecessary, stress for her. Paul spent years in psychotherapy with a psychologist who could not accept the reality of
his abduction experiences. Jerry and her first husband went to several counselors who offered useless conventional interpretations of
her abduction-related conflicts about intimacy and sexuality. There
are specific challenges for mental health professionals who treat
abductees.
There can, of course, be genuine value in trying to establish
whether some other condition might account for, or exist in addition to, abduction-related symptoms. I have been working recently
with a young woman who is struggling to come to terms with
both alien abductions and experiences of sexual abuse. Careful interviewing, however, has shown · that one set of experiences does
not explain the other, and that this woman is quite capable, when
given the opportunity, of distinguishing the different effects of
each. But evaluations of possible abduction cases should be pursued by physicians and other clinicians who are at least familiar
with and open to the reality of the phenomenon, even when they
do not "believe" in it. There is sufficient information available
now in books, popular periodicals, and other media, if not in professional journals, to suggest strongly that something that defies
conventional explanation is happening to many people. As Sheila
said, there is no excuse "for an ignorant stance."
The abduction phenomenon also raises interesting questions
about the nature of memory and the control of consciousness. As
discussed in chapter 1, prevalence or incidence polls of UFO abductions are rendered almost meaningless by the fact that long
forgotten abduction memories may be triggered by an event-Ed's
I walk along the coast in Maine, or Arthur's conversation with his
sister at a family reunion-the timing of which is itself unpredictable. What are the forces that keep the memory out of consciousness during the years-more than twenty-five in these two
cases-during which there is seemingly no recall of the events in
question? The abductees themselves feel that something more
than simple repression is at work-that some repressing force is
imposed by the alien beings themselves. Ed, as I reported, remembers being told that he will remember "when you need to know."
Sometimes this not remembering appears to protect the abductees
from a distress that they could not handle, especially in the case
of children. But we have little understanding of how this repressing force works, or, for that matter, why an altered state of consciousness, facilitated in a caring, protective setting, is so effective
in recovering abduction memories.
These odd vicissitudes of memory appear to be part of a larger
phenomenon. The aliens of these perceived encounters, or some
other agent, appear able to control the minds and perceptions of
abductees. It is common during abductions that spouses and others
who are in the room when the abductee is taken seem to be
"switched off," i.e., rendered in some way unconscious during the
abduction. This may be quite aggravating to the abductee calling
for assistance in his or her helpless distress. This alteration of con- ·
sciousness may be related to the differential perception of UFOs
themselves on the part of witnesses. There are reported occasions
in which some of the people in a particular setting may not see aUFO that is quite clear to others (Crawford 1993). Research into
these matters may, indeed, lead us through new doors of perception.
The alien abduction phenomenon appears to have something to
teach us about the redemptive and transformational role of emotion in human life. The terror, rage, grief, and, on a few occasions,
joy expressed during my sessions with experiencers, are among
the most powerful I have ever witnessed. For me and others who
have attended the sessions, as well as for the abductees themselves, it is this intensity of recovered emotion that lends inescapable authenticity to the phenomenon. Something, everyone who
goes through these sessions agrees, has happened to these people,
whether or not it is possible to identify the source of what has occurred.
Furthermore, this intense emotion, especially as it is felt and
discharged through bodily movements and powerful vocalization,
appears to have transformative power, especially when the facilitator can be fully with the experiencer through the course of its
most powerful re-evocation. The bodily responses seem quite literally to drive the experience into new realms of psychical awareness. When this occurs an expansion of consciousness or
broadening of knowledge becomes possible. Peter, for example,
found that it was the very intensity of his bodily experience when
reliving his abductions that pennitted-perhaps forced-him to
consider the reality of the alien beings themselves, which was a
basic step in his spiritual journey. It is possible that experiencing
terror, or "pushing through" it, is an intrinsic or necessary aspect
of breaking the psychological boundaries that limit our perception
of reality. When Catherine found that she was able to experience
within herself-and express fully to the alien beings-her terror
and rage, a more reciprocal, meaningful, and creative relationship
with them became possible. Indeed, the alien abduction phenomenon seems to open abductees and those who work with them to
deeper realms of human emotion, whether or not that is a specific
"purpose" of the phenomenon.
The abduction phenomenon also seems to offer new perspectives on human destructiveness. The aliens, as illustrated, for example, in Peter 's and Paul's cases, appear to some experiencers as
genuinely puzzled about the extent of our aggressiveness toward
one another and especially our apparent willingness to destroy the
planet's life. As Paul said when speaking from an alien point of
view, "'We don't understand why you choose destruction." Indeed,
the extent of this destructiveness, as reflected to us from an alien
vantage point, demonstrates the inadequacy of our biological and
psychological theories of aggression and the need for a fresh look
at this aspect of our individual and collective selves. "An organism that gets to be at such a degree of destruction should flip
back and learn upon itself," Paul said. As one who has long studied the psychological consequences of the nuclear threat, I can
only agree.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICS, TECHNOLOGY, AND BIOLOGY
The first reports of UFOs raised questions for contemporary science, which has dealt with the issue largely by ignoring or denyi ng the whole matter. If, as described in numerous reports, UFOs
are spacecraft, how did they get here? What are their propulsion
systems? How did they project light and heat of extraordinary intensity over huge distances, or accelerate and change direction in
apparent defiance of the laws of gravity? These are questions difficult to address within the parameters of modern physics. The abduction phenomenon has only added new ingredients to old
technological puzzles. How, for example, do the aliens pass people through walls? Questions such as this might seem absurd, or
suggestive only of observational error or psychosis, to those
whose parameters of reality have been limited to our understanding of the physical world as we have known it. Carlos describes
the sensation of having his cells vibrate and dissolve as he is
transported by a light beam, leaving behind a kind of ghostly
shape. B ut exactly what this transformational process consists of
we have virtually no knowledge.
What is the mechanism whereby cuts and other lesions are apparently healed so promptly? One man told me of a gash several
inches deep that appeared on his leg following an abduction experience. Yet he said this cut virtually disappeared in twenty-four
hours . What is the process whereby abductees are seemingly
tracked, so they can be found whenever and wherever the beings
wish? Are implants involved in this? It has been suggested that
the aliens are many thousands of years ahead of human beings in
their mastery of various technologies. Perhaps so. In any event,
we cannot begin to answer any of these questions within the
framework of modern science. As is frequently remarked upon in
this field, multidisciplinary studies combining physics with comparative religion and spirituality are needed to further consider
how the interdimensional bridging properties of the abduction
phenomenon might work.

PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS
When I say that the UFO abduction phenomenon seems to require
a shift in our worldview, this may be thought of in two senses. On
the one hand the aliens and the UFOs themselves seem, as discussed above, to act in ways that defy accepted laws of physics
and principles of biology, requiring that we at least extend our
know ledge of the material world before we can understand how
UFOs function. But these problems are more or less in the domain
of science as it has evolved over the centuries. After all, the capabilities of contemporary space shuttles and electronic communications systems would appear altogether magical if confronted by
someone from the Middle Ages. Yet their creation are real accomplishments of science and technology in the Western tradition. But
there are more fundamental questions raised by the abduction phenomenon which seem to lie outside the ontological framework of
modern science and appear to be unapproachable by its methods.
Foremost among these is the problem of defining in what reality
the abductions occur.
Quite a few abductees have spoken to me of their sense that at
least some of their experiences are not occurring within the physical space/time dimensions of the universe as we comprehend it.
They speak of aliens breaking through from another dimension,
through a "slit" or "crack" in some sort of barrier, entering our
world from "beyond the veil." Abductees, some of whom have
little education to prepare them to explain about such abstractions
or odd dislocations, will speak of the collapse of space/time that
occurs during their experiences. They experience the aliens, indeed their abductions themselves, as happening in another reality,
although one that is as powerfully actual to them as--or more so
than-the familiar physical world.
Sara, who is one of the most educated individuals in my sample, spoke perhaps for many experiencers when she described one
of her abductions as "dimensional merging ... You can't really
evaluate it in the language and physical descriptive terms of this
dimension," she said, "because it really wasn't happening here. It
was half happening here and half happening somewhere else."
Catherine, in a regression in January 1993, some weeks after the
last one I reported on, spoke of a "place" she remembered between times of embodiment on Earth. In that "place" bodies were
not solid, appearing only in a kind of energy outline. "This was
from a long, long, long, long time ago," she explained. "This
was before any of us had lives here. This place is in a totally different universe. It's not in our Earth space/time dimension."
A young woman abductee I will call Anne tried to explain to
me during a regression her sense of converging time frames that
occurs in her abductions. Anne felt as if she were functioning simultaneously in different times. "All times can come to one
place," she said. ''This is real. It's not philosophical," she insisted.
"I can really go to another time frame and [my experiences] can
pull me from other time frames to here."
Our use of familiar words like "happening," "occurred," and
"real" will themselves have to be thought of differently, less literally perhaps. When an event seems to have occurred in another
dimension, as described, for example, by Catherine and Anne, and
we know about it principally through powerfully felt experiencewhen consciousness is the principal available epistemological
tool-how do we decide what is "real" or "true"?
The word "dreatl).," or the idea of dreams, provides a good example of how a familiar term has to be looked at more carefully,
even redefined. When abductees call their experiences "dreams,"
which they often do, close questioning can elicit that this may be
a euphemism to cover what they are sure cannot be that, namely,
an event from which there was no awakening that occurred in another dimension. On several occasions I have seen a look of distress, even tears, on the face of an abductee who is realizing that
an experience that he or she had chosen, more comfortably, to
consider a dream had occurred in some sort of fully "awake" (another word that might need to be redefined) or conscious state,
however different this might be. The problem is complicated further by the fact that dreams are an important way that we normally process and integrate experience during the night.
Therefore, it is not surprising that, since abductions are themselves powerful and disturbing experiences, they may frequently
give rise to true nightmares or dreams that re-create in modified
form the abduction experience, even during the same night that
the abduction experience occurred.
Again, it will require careful questioning to establish whether
what is being reported is (1) an abduction, distortedly reported as
a dream; (2) a dream that relives an abduction experience; or (3)
simply a dream that contains UFO-related material but does not
necessarily reflect an abduction experience. The second scenario
may be distinguished from the first by the fact that a moment of
waking, of realizing that a dream has occurred may be identified;
or there may be elements of experience that do not occur withinthe familiar abduction scenario. Finally, we know that in the abduction the event proceeds inexorably to the end, and that the person is unable to end it or force him- or herself to "wake up." Ordinary dreams that contain UFO elements may be separated from
dreams that recapitulate abductions in that they tend to be less
vivid or intense, and the dreamer does not have the sense, as in
the abduction-related dreams, that an actual experience is concealed behind the dream representations.
Allow for the time being that there is little knowledge about the
domain from which the alien beings-whatever they "are" or
represent--derive; perhaps there are not even words or concepts
to describe it. Yet acknowledge too that something is going on
that cannot be dismissed out of hand. If, as appears now to be the
case, no traditional explanation can be found, then we may be living in a vastly different universe from that which I, for one, was
taught about at home and in school. This universe, the one that
Western science has analyzed and categorized so successfully,
consists of matter and energy, arranged exquisitely perhaps, but,
devoid, as far as we can tell, of intelligence or intelligences that
can be discovered by its methods.
In this worldview the various spirit entities, God or gods and
other mythic beings that peoples throughout the world, including
in our own culture, experience as altogether real have no objective
reality. They are the subject matter of psychology and psychopathology, anthropology, religious study, and science fiction, the projection outward of the perceptions and images of the brain. If we
make these entities real, it is through metaphor and symbol, as poets do so well. To acknowledge that the universe (or universes)
contains other beings that have been able to enter our world and
affect us as powerfully as the alien entities seem able to do would
require an expansion of our notions of reality that would all too
radically undermine the Western scientific and philosophical ideology which Tulane philosopher Michael Zimmerman calls "naturalistic humanism" (Zimmerman 1993).
The alien beings that appear to come to us from the sky in
strange spacecraft present a particularly confusing challenge to
such a naturalistic or objectivist ideology. For they seem to partake of properties belonging to both the spirit and the material
worlds, bridging, as if effortlessly, the division between these
realms which has become increasingly sacred and unbreachable
since science and religion went their separate ways in the seventeenth century (Toulmin 1990). On the one hand these beings
seem able to be seen by the abductees, who feel their bodies
moved and find small lesions inflicted upon them. On the other
hand the beings seem to come, like intermediaries from God or
the Devil, from a nonembodied source, and they are able to open
the consciousness of abductees to realms of being that do not exist
in the physical world as we know it. Before concluding I will
speculate about why the barrier between the spirit and material
worlds has become so entrenched in the West. For it is this pos1 sibly false dichotomy that makes our confrontation with beings
who do not respect this gulf so shocking.

SPIRITUAL IMPLICATIONS
I am often asked how experiences that are so traumatic, and even
appear cruel at times, can also be spiritually transformative. To me
there is no inconsistency here, unless one reserves spirituality for
realms of the sublime that are free of pain and struggle. Sometimes our most useful spiritual learning and growth comes at the
hands of rough teachers who have little respect for our conceits,
psychological defenses, or established points of view. Zen Buddhist teaching is notorious for its shock treatment methods. One
might even go further and argue that genuine spiritual growth is
inevitably disturbing, as the boundaries of consciousness are
breached and we are opened to new domains of existence. This
does not, of course, "forgive" the cruelties associated with the abduction phenomenon.
The alien beings that abductees speak about seem to many of
them to come from another domain that is felt to be closer to the
source of being or primary creation. They have been described,
however homely their appearance, as intermediaries or emissaries
from God, even as angels, by Carlos for one. The acknowledgment of their existence, after the initial ontological shock, is
sometimes (see Peter 's and Catherine's cases, for exrunple) the
first step in the opening of consciousness to a universe that is no
longer simply material. Abductees come to appreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itself intelligent. They develop a sense of awe before a mysterious cosmos that becomes
sacred and ensouled. The sense of separation from all the rest of
creation breaks down and the experience of oneness becomes an
essential aspect of the evolution of the abductee's consciousness,
as Joe spoke of in relation to his own and his baby son's development. Joe felt the choice he was facing was, as he put it, between oneness and insanity. The aliens themselves may come to
be seen as a split-off part of the abductee's soul or Self; his or herown reensoulment requires the integration of this separated dimension.
Many abductees with whom I have worked, including several
not written about in this book, experience a kind of ecstasy which,
as in Carlos's case, can reach orgasmic proportions as they feel
themselves open through their experiences (or the reliving of
them) to a divine source or creative center of being in the cosmos.
This source is, to the abductees, inexpressibly luminous and filled
with color, and they may weep when they find themselves in its
presence, for separation from it was painful beyond words. When
they do open to the source once again, they may call the experience a "return" and protest once again having to fulfill even a
newly agreed upon purpose as a human being.
As their experiences are brought into full consciousness, some
abductees come to feel increasingly a sense of oneness with all
beings and all of creation. This is often expressed through a special love of nature and a deep connection with animals and animal
spirits. Sometimes there is a strong identification with one type of
animal. Deer are, for example, "totem" creatures for Dave; Carlos
feels a special kinship with lions; and Arthur has a remarkable capacity to connect with a variety of animals. The aliens themselves,
as we have seen, may appear at various times to the abductees in
animal form. The connection that they have with animal spirits, a
kind of shamanic dimension, remains to be explored.
Finally, many if not most of the abductees with whom I have
worked intensively come to feel that their enhanced spiritual
awareness must be translated into some sort of teaching or higher
purpose. Some may be saddened, and even become hopeless
about the ecology of the planet and the fate of the earth's lifeforms. Yet they may feel that their experiences are, ultimately,
about preserving life and that they must do something toward this
end. Ed, Joe, Jerry, Eva, Peter, Sara, Arthur, and others each feel
that they have a particular mission or responsibility to teach a different sort of consciousness concerning the human place on Earth.
Some, like Peter, Ed, and Eva, have even changed their jobs or
are seeking to shift the direction of their work in order to better
fulfill their life's new purpose. Peter envisions a future "Golden
Age" of learning and opportunity, which he hopes to help bring
about.

IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN IDENTITY
Each abductee experiences in some sense an expansion of his or
her sense of self, of identity in the world. Paul wondered how we
had come to mistake the "shell" of our being for the "whole" of
it; and Eva, in her recall of the Soul Bird story of her childhood,
recognized there were compartments of self which she was opening up and merging in order to move from fragmentation toward
wholeness. The change that abductees experience is fundamentally
that they may no longer feel themselves to be separate from other
beings. They shed their identification with a narrow social role
and gain a sense of oneness with all creation, a kind of universal
connectedness.
This opening to a wider identity appears to be a direct result of
the abduction experiences, if not a central aspect of the whole
process. The change appears to be the result of two related elements. The abduction experiences themselves shatter the illusion
of our control, and demonstrate forcefully �hat we are helpless in
the face of forces and beings whose purpose we do not understand. Each abductee discovers that he or she is but one intelligent
being in a universe populated with various other entities that are
not "supposed to" exist. Human beings are not lords of the earth,
they realize, but children of the cosmos who must find their way
to live in harmony with all manner of creatures on the earth and
elsewhere. This is a terrifying lesson in humility that opens the
psyche to a wider perception of the universe, including the beings
and entities that inhabit it.
At the same time, as I noted, some abductees become open to
the presence of a divine source, which fills their being and gives
a sense of connection with a universal consciousness from which
they have come and to which they will return. "Past life" experiences, which seem to extend the sense of self over time in both
embodied and unembodied form, create a further expansion of the
feeling of what it is to be a human being. Finally, the peculiar
sense that many abductees gain during the relaxation sessions that
they have a dual huf!lan/alien identity reinforces all of the above
processes . For the alien self is felt to be a kind of missing part,
a soul link to the universal source of consciousness, the anima
mundi from which they feel they have been cut off.PoLITICAL, EcoNOMIC, AND RELIGious IMPLICATIONS
The Western scientific/materialist worldview has been hugely successful in its explorations of the physical world, revealing many
of its secrets and using this knowledge to serve human purposes.
We have overcome the harshness of winter, reduced suffering
through advances in medicine, and learned to communicate
electronically with those who are far away. At the same time we
have applied our knowledge to creating weapons of destruction
that can now easily destroy life as we know it. Our use of modern
technology to tear resources from the earth is bringing the biosphere to the brink of collapse. We are a species out of harmony
with nature, gone berserk in the indulgence of its desires at the
expense of other living beings and the earth that has given us life.
The task of reversing this trend is momentous. Even as we recognize the peril we have created, the vested interests that stand in
the way of discovering a balance in our relationship with nature
are formidable. Huge ·corporate, scientific, educational, and military institutions consume many billions of dollars of material
goods and maintain, as if mindlessly, a paralyzing stasis that is
difficult to reverse. For international business the world seems at
times to be nothing more than a giant market to be divided up
among the cleverest entrepreneurs.
But there are psychospiritual vested interests that resist change
and that are perhaps even more powerful than these material ones.
These interests are reflected in the attachment to the notion that
the physical laws we know describe all that is, and that if other
beings reside in the cosmos they will behave more or less like us.
The U.S. government-funded SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, which operates on the assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio waves out
into the universe, illustrates this bias. The possibility that advanced intelligences might not choose to communicate with us
through such a tiny or limited technological aperture, seeking perhaps some fuller opening of our consciousness, seems not to have
occurred to its inventors. As philosopher Terence McKenna has
suggested, "To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound a presumption as
to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant" (McKenna
1991).
It is not altogether clear to me why we become so attached to
our ways of seeing the world. Perhaps a comprehensive scientific
paradigm, like any ideology, gives a sense of mastery and power.
Mystery and the sense of not knowing are antithetical to the need
to maintain control and seem, at times, to inspire such terror that
we fear that we might blow apart, like the frog in the Tibetan
story when confronted with a universe too vast to comprehend.
This might explain why it is the intellectual and political elite in
our culture that seems most deeply wedded to perpetuating the
materi alist view of reality. The UFO abduction phenomenon,
which strikes at the heart of the Western paradigm and reveals us
to be utterly without control, is more readily accepted at the grassroots level than by the culturally sophisticated or most intellectually advanced among us. For it is, to a large degree, the scientific
and governmental elite and the selected media that it controls that
determine what we are to believe is real, for these monoliths are
the principal beneficiaries of the dominant ideology.
This "politics of ontology" (Mack 1992) is then the primary
arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction
phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for
our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be
taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into
the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is
free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government
and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge
that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our
homes and abduct our people would create particular problems .
This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has
been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture
of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories.
There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a
game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence
a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to
reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the
meaning of our "power" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik
Erikson called .. pseudospeciation"}, is the source of prodigious
suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more
global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in
the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distrac-
tion from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance
of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking
the phenomenon and its implications seriously.
The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are
inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature
beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit
the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth
without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of
economic "indicators" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable
collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human
population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth
does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called "market forces") is not controlled, inequities in the
distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen,
giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO
abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It
does not, cannot, "save" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it
seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed,
the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of
our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,,
profoundly "enlightening" in the fullest sense.
The UFO abduction phenomenon presents a particular problem
for some organized religions. From the beginnings of history
groups of human beings, recognizing the power and potential perils of spirit forces "out there," have taken upon themselves the
task of guiding us through the "ultimate matters" (Zock 1990) of
life. Religious leaders instruct us in the nature of God, and determine for us what spirit beings or other entities may exist in the
cosmos. The Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, for example, in
its zeal to impose a particular sort of monotheism based on the
Trinity, quite ruthlessly suppressed the nature-worshipping polytheism of much of Europe.
There can be little place, especially within the Judeo-Christian
tradition, for a variety of small but powerful homely beings who
administer an odd mixture of trauma and transcendence without
apparent regard for any established religious hierarchy or doctrine.
It is one thing to acknowledge that "spirit" resides in the universe
and "we are not alone." It is quite another for "spirit" to show up
in such an odd and threatening form, created partially in our own
image. At best, this would seem puzzling and difficult to integrate. At worst, to the polarizing perception of Christian dualism,
these dark-eyed beings must seem to be the playmates of the
:oevil (Downing 1990). Eastern religious traditions, such as Ti1lbetan Buddhism, which have always recognized a vast range of
spirit entities in the cosmos, seem to have less difficulty accepting
the actuality of the UFO abduction phenomenon than do the more
dualistic monotheisms, which offer powerful resistance to acceptance.

WHAT MIGHT THIS BE ABOUT?
It is difficult to ignore the fact that the UFO abduction phenomenon is taking place in the context of a planetary crisis of major
proportions. Human power and greed, made invincible by technol­
ogies that are ravaging the earth's environment, are bringing the
planet's biosystems to the edge of collapse. Positive efforts to arrest this process are evident at every level, but the overall destruc-
tive trend continues. Abductions seem to be concerned primarily
with two related projects: changing human consciousness to pre­
vent the destruction of the earth's life, and a joining of two species for the creation of a new evolutionary form.

CHANGING CoNSCIOUSNEss IN RELATION TO THE EARTH's EcoLOGY
Nothing in my work on UFO abductions has surprised me as
much as the discovery that what is happening to the earth has not
gone unnoticed elsewhere in the universe. But here, again, we do
·not know from what dimension or reality this apparent response is
.coming, or what we actually mean by "universe" in this context:
That the earth itself, and its potential destruction, could have an
effect beyond itself or its own environment was altogether outside
the worldview in which I was raised. But it would appear from
the information that abductees receive that the earth has value or
�importance in a larger, interrelated cosmic system that mirrors the
interconnectedness of life on earth. The alien abduction phenomenon may represent, then, some sort of corrective initiative.
Anne, the abductee to whom I referred earlier and whose case
is not included in this book, learned from her experiences that
"the whole universe is self-correcting, because if one part of the
universe can be ... like a feedback machine, the whole thing has
to be self-correcting like a feedback machine." She likened the
1 universe to a tapestry. "It's all connected. If you take one part of
the tapestry, and you put a hole in it or you rend it, you wreck the
1 parts that are next to it. If you take a thread out, the threads that
are next to it all get bumped and jostled about so you' ve got to
correct it ... If you make a mess in one part of the universe," she
continued, "you jostle the next part over, and the part that's able
to move in or to adjust will do so."
Virtually every abductee receives information about the destruction of the earth's ecosystem and feels compelled to do something
about it. But, as we have seen in the cases presented here, this is
not received merely cognitively, like a lecture. Abductees experience powerful images of vast destruction, with the collapse of
governmental and economic infrastructures and the total pollution
and desertification of the planet. This knowledge is felt profoundly in their bodies, and I have been greatly moved as they
sob on the couch and experience heartache so intense that they
can barely bring themselves to speak of it. It is the kind of knowledge that must be translated into action. Writer and futurist Jean
Houston, at the Congress of the World Parliament of Religions in
Chicago in September 1993, commented that all myths begin with
a form of betrayal. Perhaps the human betrayal of the earth itself
is giving rise to a new myth of interspecies relationship and creation.

THE HYBRID "PROGRAM"
The pioneering work of Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs has
shown what is amply corroborated in my cases, namely that the
abduction phenomenon is in some central way involved in a
breeding program that results in the creation of alien/human hybrid offspring. But we must be cautious not to assume that these
phenomena are taking place literally in our familiar material reality. Comparing the experiences of various abductees, they report
that during the abductions sperm are forcibly taken from men and
ova from women, after which this germ plasm is brought together
and altered. This process is called "genetic" by abductees and investigators, but we have no actual evidence of this. The altered
conceptus is reinserted in the uterus during a subsequent abduction, allowed to gestate for some weeks, and then removed. After
this the hybrid fetuses are "incubated" in tanks or cylinders (as
shown in Catherine's case and drawing) until the fetuses are old
enough to live outside of them in some sort of room on the ships.
Periodically the abductee mothers and fathers are brought to see
the hybrid offspring and encouraged to hold and love them, which
is one of the most disturbing aspects of the whole process. For the
abductees are naturally filled with conflict at the prospect of form-
ing a deep bond with an odd offspring that they can only see
rarely at the pleasure of the alien beings.
Despite their resentment of the forced and traumatic nature of
this process, virtually all the abductees with whom I have worked
come to accept their participation in this program. I believe that
"identification with the aggressor," as is sometimes suggested, is
a much too simple explanation of the abductees' attitude toward
the hybrid process. Many men and women come to feel, despite
their anger, that they are taking part-even that they have chosen
to participate-in a process that is life creating and life-giving.
Furthermore, for most abductees the hybridization has occurred simultaneously with an enlightenment imparted by the alien beings
that has brought home forcibly to them the failure of the human
experiment in its present form. Abduction experiencers come to
feel deeply that the death of human beings and countless other
species will occur on a vast scale if we continue on our present
course and that some sort of new life-form must evolve if the hurman biological and spiritual essence is to be preserved. They do
not generally question why the maintenance of human life must
take such an odd form.
I ask abductees repeatedly to explain to me why, if these hybrid
beings are to represent the species that will repopulate our planet
after the prophesied environmental holocaust, they appear so listless and frail on the ships, hardly vital stock to perpetuate the human or any other race. Only Peter has offered an answer by
insisting that to him the hybrids do not appear listless, but have a
vitality of their own. Jerry in a recent abduction has seen quite
beautiful, angel-like, young adult hybrids with porcelain skin;
their function was to show her on a screen the earth's inevitable
future if the present course is not changed. For me the future role
that the hybrid offspring are being prepared to play represents one
of the most puzzling aspects of the entire abduction phenomenon.
Those investigators who perceive the UFO abduction phenomenon from an adversarial perspective tend to interpret its meaning
one-sidedly. The aliens are using us, the argument goes, for their
own purposes, replenishing their genetic stock at our expense after
some sort of holocaust on their own planet. If they make us feel
that there is something worthwhile about the whole process, this
is the result of deception. I would not say that the aliens never resort to deception to hide their purposes, but the above argument
is, in my view, too narrow or linear an interpretation.
My own impression is that we may be witnessing something far
more complex, namely an awkward joining of two species, engi-
neered by an intelligence we are unable to fathom, for a purpose, that serves both of our goals with difficulties for each. I base this 
view on the evidence presented by the abductees themselves. First, many abductees, for example, Scott and Peter, become
aware in the course of our work that the alien/human union serves
the reciprocal needs of each species, completing aspects of the
identity of each that are missing or have been lost in the course 1
of evolution. Roughly speaking, the abductees experience the
aliens as having remained less densely embodied and closer to the
creative source in the universe from which human beings have
been cut off. Through their interaction with the abductees they
bring them (and all of us potentially) closer to our spiritual cosmic
roots, return us to the divine light or "Home," a "place" (really a
state of being) where secrets, jealousy, greed, and destructiveness
have no purpose. The aliens, on the other hand, as perceived by
the experiencers, long to enjoy the intense emotionality that
comes with our full embodiment. They are fascinated with our
sensuality, our warmth, our capacity for eroticism, and deep parental affection, and they seem to respond to openhearted love.
They act at times like love-starved children. They delight in
watching humans in all sorts of acts of love, which they may even
stage as they stand around watching and chattering as the
abductees perform them.
Second, the human/alien relationship itself evolves into a powerful bond. Despite their resentment and terrorization, the
abductees may feel deep love toward the alien beings, especially
toward the leader figures, which they experience as reciprocated,
despite the cold and businesslike way the abductions themselves
are conducted. The aliens may be perceived as true family, having
protected the experiencers from human depredations, disease, and
loss. The leader may be seen as a familiar, loving, and wise figure, known by the experiencer since childhood and, ultimately,
forgiven for the change from playfulness to a more serious or
grim purpose that occurs in the abductions when puberty is
reached and the hybrid-creating process begins.

Anne describes an amusing incident that occurred at the end of
one of her abductions in which an alien being seemed unwittingly
to betray his affection for her. She had been returned to her bed
at home and was, presumably, asleep. But she awoke to see one
of the beings "looking at me with a loving look ... just looking
at my face, looking at my features ... looking at my eyes, looking at them with such emotion, such love ... When he found out
I was awake," she said, "he freaked out ... His eyes [crinkled],
they [got] smaller. I think his mouth did open, but it was like a
silent kind of, he didn't really make any noise when he
screamed." She saw in· his face "a hint of fine, long bone strucfture." When she looked into his eyes the expression was one of
"Oh, my God, you' re awake and I'm in a shitload of trouble," and
"then he went whoosh out the window ... floating horizontal,
like lengthwise ... I think he was like a doctor-in-training," Anne
observed, and "he wasn't supposed to take it personally ... an
alien would be in trouble for waking somebody up because they
don't want us to know that they're around."
The connection that human beings experience through looking
into the eyes of the aliens seems to be a central feature of the acknowledgment of the existence of the beings and the establishment of the bond itself. Abductees have repeatedly described to
me a loving, totally engulfing feeling they experience when they
look into these huge, black, all-knowing eyes. This contact is
"fifty times more powerful" than any human-to-human connection, one woman said to me. For Peter and other men the eye connection serves to restore a lost "brotherhood," sundered when we
were both-humans and aliens-separated from a common primordial source. The experience can be one of profound, total,
even blissful merging. Some abductees have experienced actual
alien-human sexual connection or partnership-Joe, for example,
in his alien identity and Peter as a human connecting powerfully
with an alien partner with whom he is parenting hybrid offspring.
It needs to be stressed that we do not know if any of the above
phenomena exist literally on the purely material plane of reality,
despite the apparent physical manifestations, such as perceived
pregnancies and hybrid babies. According to the reports of the
abductees, the aliens seem to stress the evolutionary aspect of
the species-joining process, the repopulation of the earth subsequent to a total environmental collapse. But all this may be in
some mysterious way a kind of play of consciousness, embodied
in some sense, yet at the same time separate from our physical
bodies. It could all be "educational," a kind of mythic drama, intended by a transcendent intelligence to move our being to a
higher level. Or the merger of the alien and human species might
be more literally real, its very awkwardness the result of the prodigious difficulty of bringing together a densely embodied race
such as ours with more nearly spiritual entities like the alien beings.


ANOTHER INTELLIGENCE AT WORK: WHY DOES THIS SEEM SO MOMENTOUS?
At the end of one of her regressions Anne said, "Something else
is interested in us that we don't want to know about. This is happening. It's not just a happy little dream where you can feel like
you' re important. This is really a responsibility, and things that
you don't want to see happen are going to happen." Yet within
our culture, at least for those who determine for us what we are
to accept as real, the very existence of this other intelligence, this
"something else" that is "intere�ted in us," is difficult to accept.
Why should this be so, since every culture from the beginning of
recorded time and throughout most of the world, even in our own
time, has accepted the existence of other intelligences in the universe?
I have discussed already some of the reasons why the reality of
the abduction phenomenon has been so difficult for our culture to
accept-the material and philosophical vested interests, for example, attached to the Western worldview. But I believe there is a
core belief in our culture that is violated by the alien abduction
phenomenon, namely the total separation of the spirit and the
. physical world. We have made that gulf inviolate, relegating to religion the spirit (subjective) world and assigning to science the
material (objective) domain. We simply do not know what to do
with a phenomenon that crosses that seemingly inviolable barrier.
It shocks the foundations of our belief structure. Our minds have
no place to put such a thing.
The Dalai Lama once pointed out that the devastation of the
planet's ecology was destroying not only the habitat of plants and
animals but the realms in which the spirits reside as well. Perhaps
this has left them no choice but to manifest in our world, to appear to us in the only "language" that remains to us, the language
of the physical World. In the context of the planet's crisis they
have had no choice, but must find some way, however difficult, to
come to us. Perhaps our consciousness has become so atrophied
that we are simply unable, on our own, to be open to the spirit
world. Could it be that the intense resistance with which the alien
abduction phenomenon is sometimes met could be related to the
shock it brings to our carefully crafted psychological boundaries,
reopening us to a world from which we have distanced ourselves,
reanimating those senses whereby we might again know worlds 1
beyond the manifest physical reality? Perhaps we have created the
spiritual conditions that have made this necessary.

FURTHER IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
With the opening of consciousness to new domains of being,
:abductees encounter patterns and a design of life that brings them
a profound sense of interconnectedness in the universe. For Dave
this took the form of meaningful coincidences, similar to what
Jung called synchronicities, which he seemed to discover every­
· where he went, especially after he came to terms with his abduction experiences. Thoughts and ideas may appear more organically
·connected with the physical world during abduction experiences
than ordinarily seems apparent in everyday life. Metaphor becomes tangible or reified. Peter's "fourth step" through the wall of
a Nantucket house during his August 1992 abduction was both a
literal physical action and at the same time powerfully symbolic
of his decision to accept his passage from one plane of reality to
.another. For Arthur the illuminated thread or string which, quite
literally, was the source of energy that carried him to the space­
. ship when he was nine came to stand quite concretely for the ties
that have connected him with others during his life.
A forty-one-year-old health care executive spoke to me of large
tubes through which he passed during one of his abductions "into
the next plane where there was this light ... It was like a birth because there was fluid" in the tubes. Going through the tube was
'both literally and metaphorically a "rebirth," a passage "through
the veil to the other side." Catherine in an abduction subsequent
to the ones described in my chapter about her also spoke of a tube
or tunnel through which she and others passed from a spirit plane
outside space/time back to the embodied physical state on Earth.
Abduction experiences also open the consciousness of
abductees as I work with them to cycles of birth and death that
are reminiscent of the Tibetan transitional realities or bardos
(Sogyal Rinpoche 1992). This is most clearly illustrated in the
past life experiences that are emerging increasingly in our sessions
as I have become willing to listen to them. These reports suggest
that individual consciousness may have its own line of development, separate from the body. In our sessions abductees such as
Dave, Joe, Catherine, and Eva have told with great feeling of periods of embodiment, followed by deaths quite vividly
reexperienced. They speak of a return to or diffusion into some
sort of primal or universal creative consciousness or source, and
then a later rebirth through a woman's womb into a new embodiment on Earth.
The transition at the time of bodily death seems to include, as
Joe recounted, a feeling of being literally lighter and thinner. "It's
good to be back," he said. 'This is much more real." Eva reported
"going up, expanding, joy." She went "into a white, gold light"
and saw a dove released from a cage. ''That's my soul," she said.
In certain cases the alien beings, who seem to reside or belong in
this fluid dimension (although they periodically become embodied · to some degree on Earth), seem to have been with the abductees
through more than one lifetime. As discussed in considerable detail in Dave's and Joe's cases, it is possible to trace a development
or evolution of consciousness in the sequence of lives that they
have experienced over time.
It is not necessary to postulate that a past life identity belongs
literally to the individual abductee in the same way that our bodies are only ours while we inhabit them. As biologist Rupert Sheldrake has suggested, it is possible that there exi sts a kind of
eternal collective memory on which we all may draw. One might,
Sheldrake suggests, "tune in to particular people in the past who
are now dead, and, through morphic resonance, pick up memories
of past lives." This does not prove, he says, that "you were that
person" (Sheldrake 1992). This idea is consistent with the observation that the psyche or memory of the abductees seems to be
able to travel, especially during the opening of consciousness that
occurs in our sessions, to wherever or whenever the evolutionary
requirement of the moment seems to take it.

THE PARADIGM SHIFT
Needless to say none of this makes much sense within the modern
worldview brought to us by Western science, whose "governing
assumption," in philosopher Richard Tamas's words, is that "any
meaning the human mind perceives in the universe does not exist
intrinsically in the universe but is projected onto it by the human
mind" (Tamas, in progress). To Tamas "this complete voiding of
the cosmos, this absolute privileging of the human" is perhaps the ,"ultimate anthropocentric projection, the most subtle yet prodigious form of human self-aggrandizement" and represents an intellectual "hubris of cosmic proportions."
The experiences recounted by the abductees with whom I have
worked during the past four years constitute, I think, a rich body
of evidence to support the idea that the cosmos may contain at
least a few types of beings or intelligences whose source and purpose is quite unknown to us. Abductees may be led through their
experiences to feel that the cosmos is inherently intelligent in sub- ,
tie, complex, and exquisite ways that they can hardly begin to
fathom. I am reminded, particularly, of Carlos here. Other evidence, including the thoroughly documented near-death experiences and extraordinarily intricate and symbolic crop formations
appearing all over the world, provide additional indications, if we
will allow ourselves to realize their implications, of various expressions of intelligence in a universe that is reaching toward us.
As I come to the end of this story I cannot help wondering
what it might take to bring about the shift in consciousness in the
society as a whole, the change of paradigm, that is implicit in
what the abductees have undergone. It would appear that what is
required is a kind of cultural ego death, more profoundly shattering (a word that many abductees use when they acknowledge the
actuality of their experiences) than the Copernican revolution
which demonstrated that the earth, and therefore humankind, did
not reside at the center of the cosmos. UFO abductions and related phenomena suggest first that humans are not the preeminent
intelligent beings in a universe more or less empty of conscious
life. But abductees' experiences also indicate that we are participating in a cosmos that contains intelligent beings that are far
more advanced than we are in certain respects and have the power
to render us helpless for purposes we are only just beginning to
fathom.
Each abductee appears to me like a pioneer on a hero's journey.
For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us
to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the
existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human
psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly
interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to
acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer.
I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the
spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. "Why don't
they land on the White House lawn?" is the reigning cliche. The
most popular answer to this question among those who take the
phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest
themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might
attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the
rest of us.
I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that
is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book.
The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not
operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the
top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids
a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally
require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that
something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer
the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of
the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we
live in a universe different from the one in which we have been
taught to believe.
There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be
evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one
enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what
the hybrid "program," which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is
that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at
work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on
Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened.
But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view,
admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a
hope, of my own.
What is the vision of the possible human future that the
abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness
and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a
kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely
lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our
world, we might discover our place as one species among many
whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational
thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr�­
eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe
filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might
be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend.
The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a
fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the
sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective,
the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and
resources divided among competing human groups. The earth
would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place
where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic
Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches
open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided
mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world.
The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that
remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes
or their methods. It seems clear, however, that "they" have had to
come to "us," appearing in material form so that we might know
them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered
time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even
communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the
guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers
a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and
may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents,
quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the
choice to us.

================================================================
APPENDIX A: A BRIEF REVIEW OF ISSUES RELATING TO THE REALITY OF THE ABDUCTION PHENOMENON

Since the publication of the hardcover edition of this book in
April 1994, a number of questions have been raised about the reality of the alien abduction phenomenon and the evidential basis
for crediting the experiencers' accounts of what has happened to
them. These questions relate to the nature of the physical evidence
which accompanies the abduction reports; the clients' expectations
and possible investigator influence; the reliability of memory in
relation to the experiences; the degree to which hypnosis influences the accuracy of memory; and alternatives to the hypothesis
that what the experiencers describe is, allowing for the ordinary
reconstructions of memory, what has occurred. This is an entirely
new area of inquiry, and these are questions that can only be answered fully by a great deal more research. This appendix has
been added to begin a discussion of these questions, especially by
highlighting those aspects of the abduction phenomenon that, in
my view, would need to be considered if such future explorations
are to prove fruitful.

THE ONTOLOGICAL CONTEXT
Before any of these matters may be usefully considered, it is important to place the abduction phenomenon in an ontological
context. For the "reality status" of this, like any subject, will determine the relevance of more specific questions and criticisms.
This book describes a clinical map of the abduction territory,
which I believe shows that we are dealing with a phenomenon
that may not originate in our physical reality but penetrates variably into it or manifests within it in a variety of ways. This very
concept is somewhat revolutionary and difficult to understand
within our current modern secular worldview. Nevertheless, my
experiences with abductees push me toward this conclusion.
In the case of some abduction experiences, the individual appears actually to be missing as reported by others. But other incidents seem more like out-of-body experiences, or even encounters
with strange forms of ligh� sound, vibratory or other energies capable of creating strong tactile sensations but without the occurrence of. anything that could be called an abduction in any literal
sense. The phenomenon appears to operate in subtle, elusive, even
"tricky," ways, as if a mischievous intelligence were at work. Yet
I have come to the view after five years of involvement in this
field that this subtlety is intrinsic to it and must be embraced if we
are to penetrate the mysteries of the abduction phenomenon.
To some of my critics the possibility that the abduction experience actually occurred but not altogether in our physical reality,
nor in any reality or dimension to which we have access by empirical means, would be a contradiction in terms. But others have
been open to the possibility that these experiences are occurring,
at least in part, in another reality. Scientists like Fred Alan Wolf,
Rudolph Schild, Jacques Vallee, Carl Brunstadt, and Ronald
Bryan are confronting the possibility that there exist parallel universes or other dimensions of reality from which information and
material may enter our physical world.
But if the possibility may be allowed that there are "unseen"
domains of reality, and in exploring abduction experiences we are
dealing with a realm or realms in which objective, direct, and external measurement is not possible, then we must, of necessity,
rely for our knowledge on subjective reports of human experience.
Even research like psychiatric social worker John Carpenter's accounts of experiencers abducted simultaneously, where the reports
corresponded in minute detail, depends on the evaluation of subjective experience (Carpenter 1993).
It seems to me that a responsible and encompassing study of
the abduction phenomenon calls for the development and application of a science of subjective experience, such as that described
by Stolorow ( 1992). As personal reports are our principal source
of knowledge of abductions, we must be especially rigorous in
evaluating their authenticity, affective intensity, and consistency in
comparing them with one another, as well as the motivation, skep-
ticism, believability, and sincerity of the reporter in reference to
his or her experience, and the relation of the abduction experiences to the story of the person's life. I might point out, however,
that this kind of evaluation of subjective accounts without corroborating physical evidence is the principal data of psychoanalysis
and psychodynamic psychiatry. A correct psychodynamic formulation explains past memories and current behaviors and predicts
future behaviors. Similarly, an adequate analysis of subjective abduction experience should be corroborated by and inform physical
findings as well as predict future events.

THE QUESTION OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
I have been faulted frequently by critics, especially by professional colleagues in science and medicine, and even by those in
the UFO field itself who are seeking legitimacy within mainstream science, for not dealing in this book more fully with the
physical evidence that does exist for UFOs and abductions. This
is a fascinating and controversial field that invites further study by
those best qualified to do so. But it is important to keep in mind
that every aspect of the physical evidence-from the sightings of
UFOs, the burned earth they leave behind, and the strange behavior of electronic devices in association with abductions, to the reported absences of abductees during the abductions, n:llssing
pregnancies, subcutaneous implants, bodily cuts, scoop marks, and
other skin lesions-is also, as described above, subtle, elusive,
and difficult to prove. There is a large literature in this field which
the interested reader might wish to consult (Hopkins 1987;
Pritchard 1992; Vallee 1988; Jacobs 1992; Fowler 1979; Neal
1992; Howe 1989). I have chosen in this book to emphasize my
strong suit as a psychiatrist, namely, the power of carefully evaluated experiential reports corroborated where possible by physical
evidence.
From my perspective, the physical evidence is important to corroborate the experiencers' reports. But if taken out of this context,
the physical phenomena are rarely sufficiently robust to stand in
their own right. If, for example, I were to publish photographs of
skin lesions, even from several experiencers who obtained them in
the same night during reported abductions (as occurred in one
case in Aorida), I would, as a physician, be leaving myself open
to the legitimate criticism by dermatologists that I could not prove
that they were directly related to the abduction experiences and
not caused by other factors.

CLIENT EXPECTATIONS AND POSSIBLE INVESTIGATOR INFLUENCE
Another central issue in the study of abduction experiences concerns the possibility of investigator suggestion or influence. Critics have speculated that experiencers are producing abduction
accounts in compliance with my expectations or influence. As a
psychiatrist, I am well aware of how powerful the caring intention
of a therapist can be iri helping people change their lives. I have,
therefore, tried to be extremely scrupulous to avoid using that
power to elicit abduction material. Colleagues and others who
have observed my regression sessions, or who have transcribed regression sessions, verify that I do not lead my cases (Karen
Speerstra, personal communication, 1994 ). Indeed, if I consciously attempt to lead experiencers, I find it peculiarly difficult
to do so, in or out of hypnosis; they will directly contradict a
statement which is incorrectly reflected back to them, and will
clearly differentiate between material from their own experience
and material they have heard or read about which is inconsistent
with their own. Furthermore, I am often surprised and startled by
the material revealed to me by experiencers. When I was beginning this work their reports shattered all expectations, and they
continue to challenge my own sense of reality. For these reasons
I find it unlikely that experiencers are trying to provide stories
which conform to my expectations. Finally-and important for me
to underscore as a clinician-in speaking to the experiencers in a
manner that accepts the emotional truthfulness of their reports, I
am not taking a position that validates the literal occurrence of
these experiences in our physical reality; good clinical practice,
especially in cases of traumatized individuals, must follow different guidelines than "objective" scientific investigation.
There is, however, the possibility that the experiencers are
responding to more subtle pressures or expectations. I cannot altogether dismiss this possibility, but there are factors which argue
against it as a significant distorting element. Current research delineates two areas of suggestibility which may, at first glance, be
relevant to the retrieval of biased abduction reports. The first area
concerns post-event suggestibility. Laboratory memory researchers
have shown that apparently innocuous but leading questions about
the details of a slide show or film can significantly impair accuracy of responses (Loftus 1993). But abduction experiences differ
from laboratory experiences in that the former are firsthand, emotionally charged, and of central importance. Indeed, researchers of
events of impact have concluded that memory for these events is
retained better than laboratory audio-visual stimuli (Christianson
I 992). Second, the more involved a person is · in an event, the
greater the likelihood that the central event is accurate! y remembered over time (Yuille and Tollestrup I 992). Emotion has been
shown to aid memory for the central event of the story, although
it undermines memory for more peripheral details (Reisberg and
Heuer I 992). Thus, the lower levels of accuracy found in laboratory memory research are not likely to be directly applicable to
abduction research. Clearly, investigators should try to minimize
the use of leading questions in any case.
Investigation of interrogatory suggestibility clearly demonstrates that, under situations of extreme social pressure, false beliefs about actions and events can be created (Gudjonsson I 991;
Brown, in press). My interactions with experiencers do not approach the conditions under which such false beliefs develop.
First, my relationship with experiencers is not closed or exclusive.
Individuals contact me and meet with me irregularly, with
meetings weeks, months, or years apart. After initial disclosure to
a willing listener, many experiencers are reluctant to continue to
discuss their experiences, as they find it necessary to distance
themselves from the material in order to cope with their daily
lives. Second, there is little or no social value to be gained from
reporting abduction experiences. Third, no repeated questioning or
intense focus on past events is"necessary to bring forth these experiences; abduction material arises quite readily, often with a
minimum of relaxation and an attentional shift from an external
focus.
Lastly, experiencers are not motivated to believe in the "truth"
of their experiences. Often they prefer to believe that they have
had some sort of bad dream, and become intensely distressed
when they realize in the interview that they were not asleep when
the experience began. Or they hope that I will find some sort of
psychiatric explanation that can be treated so that the experiences .
can be stopped. Not only does the discovery of the actuality of the
abduction experiences "shatter" their sense of reality, but this realization means that they may be subject to these disturbing experiences in the future.
Accepting the presence of these extraordinary events in their
lives helps experiencers cope with some of the negative repercussions from those experiences. However, even after the powerful
"reliving" of abduction experiences, these individuals usually continue to resist accepting the actuality of what they report at some
level. Catherine, for example, who told me the story described in
chapter 7, became upset when I recently gave her a scientist's report of media accounts of UFO sightings along the Northeast Atlantic coast in March 1991. These accounts corresponded to the
time of one of her most powerful abduction experiences. This circumstantial corroboration of her experience in the physical world
undercut some of the remaining denial of its actuality, which had
enabled her to remain productive in a culture which also denies
this reality, and tends to discredit people who report such experiences.

RELIABILITY OF MEMORY
The apparently false accusation in some instances of parents and
other adults by individuals claiming they have been sexually
abused has led to a contemporary controversy regarding the accuracy of reports of previously forgotten memories, especially as recovered in the context of psychotherapy (Lindsay and Read 1994;
Brown, in press). The criticism of "false" or inaccurate memory
has, not unexpectedly, been leveled at abduction reports. Here,
again, the problem of responding to the relevant argum�nts is
complicated by the fact that we are still in the process of trying
to learn what has happened. In what reality is this phenomenon
occurring? Since we cannot answer the matter of the accuracy of
abduction memories by offering physical proof, the appropriate
questions might be: did something happen to these individuals
and, if so, how do we decide what it was?
There is good evidence that we can, indeed, trust · that something extraordinary has happened to experiencers. As mentioned
above, most research in the memory field indicates that memories
associated with events that are of central importance to the individuals ' lives tend to be more accurate than those that are of more
peripheral significance (Christianson 1992). In such core experiences, as previously noted, emotion tends to aid memories of the
central events of the story while undermining memory for more
peripheral events (Reisberg and Heuer 1992). Adding complexity
to this picture, however, are the findings that traumatic memories,
or experiences occurring under conditions of high arousal, may be
stored differently in the limbic system of the brain than less intense events (van der Kolk 1994; Ledoux 1993). In these situations memory appears to be encoded along sensorimotor,
olfactory, and visual channels, rather than within the semantic
framework of normal memory. This may make traumatic memo-
ries less vulnerable to the same reconstructive but distorting tendencies of normal memory processing (van der Kolk 1994; .
Corbisier 1994; Brown, in press) . However, at the present time
this is merely speculation. There is little hard data about the accuracy of material transformed from traumatic to semantic memory.
More research is needed in this area.
Clearly abduction experiences are of vital importance to their
experiencers and they are sometimes, although not always, highly
traumatic. Virtually everyone who has been with an abduction experiencer while he or she was recovering abduction material has
been impressed with the affective power and the intensity of the
bodily sensations that the individual is undergoing. These observers, like myself, have been impressed that something important
has happened, even if we cannot know exactly what took place,
or that every detail reported was exactly accurate. Similarly, in
commenting on the controversial application of laboratory memory research to the courts, Scheflin notes: "it is illogical to reason
from the fact [emphasis his] that a memory has false details to the
conclusion that there is no real incident from which this false
memory is an accurate depiction" (Scheflin, in press).
As has so often been said, there is, as yet, no recorded abduction experience that proved, upon investigation, to be a reflection
of some other trauma or experience, despite a great deal of effort
on the part of investigators to find some other source for these experiences. Nevertheless, therapists must be very careful not to validate the literal truth of what abduction experiencers report,
helping experiencers keep an open mind as to what "happened"
while exploring all possibilities. It seems clear to me at this time
that we are not dealing · with "false" or confabulated memories.
However, because we are so dependent in abduction research
upon subjective recall, it is vitally important to continue to collect
abduction accounts from many different individuals so that the
consistencies, variabilities, and other qualities of these narratives
may be more firmly established.

ACCURACY OF HYPNOSIS
The potential inaccuracy of memories recalled under hypnosis
must be considered in evaluating abduction reports (Frankel
1993). Studies do show that inaccurate material may be recovered
under hypnosis (McConkey 1992; Scheflin and Shapiro 1989).
For this reason, hypnotically obtained reports must be compared
to reports made from conscious recall, and to other corroborating
evidence. However, it is wrong to assume "that because hypnosis
can interfere with memory it i nevitably must do so" (Scheflin, in
press).
My personal experience is that abduction material recovered
under hypnosis parallels what has been obtained by conscious reporting. And, although research shows that some subjects have
greater confidence in both these and false memories, recalled
under hypnosis, the abduction experiencers with whom I have
worked retain, for the most part, a skeptical and inquiring attitude
regarding the factual accuracy of their encounters-this in spite of
the emotional power of the apparent memories that are recovered.
Furthermore, in some of my cases (see, for example, Ed and
Sheila in chapters 3 and 4) the material recalled during the regression seemed more likely to be accurate than that reported in faceto-face interviews because 1) the information was less self-serving
or compatible with positive self-esteem, or, conversely, more disturbing to self-regard, and, in some instances, even humiliating; 2)
the material that emerged in the regressions was more believable
in the sense that it was consistent with accounts provided by other
experiencers-it lacked the gloss and ordering of recollections in
conformity with conventional reality that tends to occur with conscious reporting; and 3) although emotional involvement is no
guarantee of the accuracy of memory with or without hypnosis,
the intensity of affect and expressed bodily feeling that occurs
during the regression sessions of abduction experiencers is so
powerful that even the most determined skeptic would be hardpressed to conclude that something quite extraordinary and realityshattering did not occur. Sheila's psychiatrist, for example, who
had worked with her for seven years, came away from the two regressions he observed convinced that if not actual alien abductions, something very much like them had occurred.
It is hard to imagine how the psyche could generate so intense
a level of emotion without some kind of exposure to an extraordinary experience as the template for that emotion. Most importantly, it might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the
material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters
appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal
relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word "hypnosis" at all.
The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer's need
to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face
conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing
memories and emotion. In the case of the abduction phenomenon
this process appears to fill out the recalled experience. Ongoing
research is needed to explore the degree to which significant distortion occurs with hypnosis in abduction cases.

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS
It is useful, I think, to observe that the most intense demand for
alternative explanations tends to come from those who are either
unfamiliar with the rich complexity of the abduction phenomenon
itself, or from those who are so wedded to a worldview in which
the idea of an intelligence or beings from outside of the earth visiting us is simply not possible, that they fmd unacceptable the idea
that such experiences might actually be occurring. These individuals might believe in the existence of a personal God or a supreme being, yet not find possible the notion that cosmic entities
such as these might enter our physical and mental world. What
some of these critics may not realize is that frequently abduction
experiencers have already been subjected to intense investigations
of their abduction-related symptoms by physicians and various
mental health professionals seeking a variety of neurophysiological and/or psychological and emotional explanations, sometimes
with frustrating and even damaging effects (see, for example, the ­
cases of Scott, Sheila, and Paul in this book).
It is not possible within the confines of this study to review all
of the alternative explanations that have been offered to account
for the abduction phenomenon. They range from various forms of
psychopathology to physiological disorders or responses of the
brain to psychosocial and cultural interpretations. Most of these
ignore fundamental aspects of the phenomenon, such as the strong
doubting of the experiencers themselves, the tight association with
UFOs (sometimes observed independently in the experiencer's
community), the various physical findings (including the fact that
the experiencer is sometimes observed to be missing), or the occurrence of the phenomenon in small children. For any theory to
be taken seriously it must, at least potentially, take into account
the entire complex range of phenomena associated with alien abduction experiences.
Psychiatric examinations and numerous psychological tests
have failed to reveal forms of mental illness that could, conceivably, explain the abduction phenomenon (Mack 1995;
Bloecher, Clamar, and Hopkins 1985 ; Parnell and Sprinkle
1990; Rodeghier, Goodpastor, and Blatterbauer 1991; Zimmer
1984; Spanos, Cross, Dickson, and DeBreuil 1993). Some have
suggested that we might be dealing with some sort of displacement from another kind of trauma, especially sexual abuse (Klass
1988). It is true that abduction experiences do show some of the
symptoms associated with post-traumatic states, but these symptoms appear to be the result, not the cause, of what the experiencers have undergone. Furthermore, there is much more involved in
the complex narratives of abduction experiences than human
trauma per se. There are, for example, consistent details of passage to and from the craft, the rich descriptions of the alien beings
and the intricate relationships to them, the n1any non-traumatic activities and observations that occur within the craft, and the elaborate communications concerning the earth's ecology and other
psychospiritual matters which are, in my experience, a frequent, if
not regular, dimension of the abduction phenomenon. I have never
encountered anything similar to this in patients I have known to
be traumatized by humans, or in psychotic patients suffering from
delusions.
Some experiencers do have histories of sexual abuse and other
traumas. One investigator has even found a higher than average
incidence of sexual abuse among individuals reporting UFO encounters (Ring · 1992). If abduction were acting as an effective
screen memory, one would expect the prevalence of sex abuse to
be lower, not higher. Furthermore, abduction experiencers seem
able, when interviewed carefully, to distinguish the residua of
their alien abduction experiences from other kinds of trauma they
may have undergone. It bears repeating that no case has yet been
reported where the alien abduction story masked another kind of
traumatic experience. The reverse, however, has frequently been
noted, including in my case experience-i.e. that a client presepting with a complaint of possible sexual abuse or trauma has discovered a history of alien abduction experiences, even when being
treated by a therapist unfamiliar with the phenomenon and certainly not expecting that an abduction story would emerge. Others
have suggested that abduction experiences are a reworking of
imagery related to birth trauma. Lawson ( 1984) and his colleague
McCall found that imagined abduction imagery in a small sample
of nonexperiencers was related to aspects of their birth histories,
but this has not yet been replicated with individuals reporting abduction experiences. Obviously, the relationship between abduction phenomena and other forms of trauma needs to be
investigated further.
Others explain abduction phenomena based on the notion that
abduction experiencers have personality traits, such as fantasy
proneness, hypnotizability, or a strong tendency to dissociation,
which predispose them to these experiences. Individuals who are
highly hypnotizable have the capacity to generate rich images and
fantasies which are reported to rival real events in intensity (Wickramaseka 1986). Studies by Rodeghier et al. (1991) and
Spanos (1993) fo�nd that experiencers were neither more hypnotizable nor more fantasy prone than the general population, although these results remain to be replicated. Abduction may be
related to dissociation, a tendency to split off some elements of
the ego from disturbing mental content in order to preserve the
stability and functioning of the psyche (Jacobsen 1995; Powers
1994). But as already discussed in this book, dissociation is a coping mechanism; a strong tendency to dissociate tells us nothing
per se about the source of the stress that gave rise to this mode
of adaptation.
Neurophysiological explanations include sleep paralysis and
temporal lobe epilepsy (Spanos et al . 1993; Persinger 1992;
Blackmore 1994), but researchers exploring these possibilities
have either failed to find such pathology among abduction experiencers or have chosen to overlook important aspects of the phenomenon. For example, many abduction experiences occur under
conditions that do not appear to be associated with sleep. Second,
abduction experiences are often corroborated by independent UFO
sightings or physical evidence. Third, neurophysiological explanations do not account for hyperarousal and anxiety triggered by
certain events or images symbolically linked to abduction. With
the integration of the specific abduction-related traumatic experience, these reactions sometimes resolve, as predicted by theories
of post traumatic stress disorder.
Some have suggested that in alien abductions we are dealing
with some sort of mass psychosis, hysteria, or hallucination
(Sagan 1993). But abductions do not resemble mass phenomena
(Hall 1995). Abductees are generally individuals who have, at
least before being brought in contact with other experiencers for
purposes of support, been isolated from people having similar experiences. Many of the details they report are not known in the
culture or, at least until recently, reported in the mass media. Although it cannot be proven that no elements of abduction experiences have been incorporated from these media, by and large
abductees avoid media accounts of abductions and are uniquely
distressed by them. My impression is that the traffic is stronger
the other way-i.e. that abduction stories, based on actual clinical
cases, find their way into the work of media producers hungry for
this material. Careful research on the complex relationship between the electronic and print media and the evolution of the alien
abduction phenomenon waits to be undertaken.
Finally, a Jungian depth psychological explanation of abductions might be fertile ground for further explanation, especially
since Carl Jung pioneered the exploration of this field (Shubow
1994). Abductees may, in fact, communicate in their reports material suggestive of the Jungian archetypes of birth, death, cosmic
powers, joining with the source of creation, etc. This material, I
believe, is important insofar as it reflects the profound psychological impact, opening, and meaning of the abduction experiences. I
have considered a Jungian interpretation, but a radical application
such as this of Jung's notion of archetypes would inevitably introduce a wealth of new philosophical and scientific questions, without the possil?ility of doing justice to them. Unless we are tp
consider the whole universe in its psychospiritual and physical dimensions as but the play of consciousness, we would be hardpressed to explain UFOs and all the physical elements associated
with the abduction phenomenon in these purely depth psychological terms. In addition, a Jungian approach, to be really helpful,
would need to account for the rich complexity, the detailed narrative consistency, and the specific contemporary forms of the UFO
phenomenon and the abduction experiences.

SUMMARY
In sum, the position to which I have come, after many hundreds
of hours of work with abduction experiencers, is that we are dealing here with a profound mystery that has potentially vast implications for our contemporary world. For I have no basis for
concluding as yet that anything other than what experiencers say
happened to them actually did. The experiential data, which, in
the absence of more robust physical evidence, is the most important information that we have, suggests that abduction experiencers have been visited by some sort of "alien" intelligence
which has impacted them physically and psychologically. Indeed,
this conclusion fits so tightly with· the data that I and other abduction researchers have collected, that it is doubtful to me that this
possibility would be so vigorously resisted if the phenomenon did
not violate our scientific worldview and the implied control of our
living environment that accompanies it.
It seems impossible to avoid the observation that the alien abduction phenomenon is occurring in the context of a planetary
ecological crisis that is reaching critical proportions and that information about this situation is often powerfully conveyed by the
alien beings to the experiencers. As part of our effort to explore
whether the abduction phenomenon, as has been suggested, is primarily a Western occurrence, my colleague Dominique Callimanopulos and I have been exploring alien abductions in other
countries and among American indigenous peoples.
In November 1994, we interviewed Credo Mutwa, a Zulu medicine man in South Africa, who described classical abduction experiences, and we also talked with many children in a school
outside Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, who reported seeing in
broad daylight during a classroom break several UFOs and two
alien beings just outside the schoolyard perimeter. Mr. Mutwa,
who was seventy-three when we i nterviewed him, recalled vividly,
for example, a terrifying experience he had had when he was
thirty-seven. While on a mining job in the bush he was suddenly
transported to an enclosure with curved walls where he found
himself on a table surrounded by alien beings whose description
was similar to the small "grays" with which we are familiar in
this country. He was then subjected to the kinds of humiliating experiences described in this book. In February 1994, a fanner in
Brazil reported to us with intense feeling a similar encounter with
small gray beings.
Mr. Mutwa and the children were both distressed by their experiences. But they also spoke spontaneously of receiving powerful
communications from the alien beings, especially through their
huge black eyes, about the failure of our species to take proper
care of the earth. This unsolicited information is quite consistent
with what I have been learning from American experiencers. A
recently interviewed geologist and abduction experiencer wrote
me that his experiences have taught him that "We are a run-away
species bent on self-destruction, because we (collectively) are unwilling to impose self controls to stop our growth and to plan for
our future with forethought and higher purpose" (Bruce Cornet,
letter to the author, December 1994 ).
The interpretations and conclusions in this book are hypotheses,
designed to invite others to join me in the exploration of this important mystery. The alien abduction field is a new one, and it deserves a broad and systematic multi-disciplinary inquiry. It is my
hope that, if nothing else, this book will encourage at least some
of the skeptics who have criticized my methods and hypotheses to
immerse themselves in the primary data of this field, namely the
experiences of those who have undergone the abduction encounters, and draw their own conclusions about what is taking place
here and what it might mean for the human future.

APPENDIX B: A HISTORICAL AND CROSSCULTURAL PERSPECTIVE ON REPORTED ENCOUNTERS BY DOMINIQUE CALLIMANOPULOS AND JOHN E. MACK, M.D.

BEINGS FROM THE SKY OR OTHER DOMAINS THROUGH HISTORY
The connection between humans and beings from other. dimensions has been illustrated in myths and stories from various cultures for millennia. There are peoples around the world who
customarily communicate with nonhuman intelligences and spirits
through a variety of means. These communications and the myths
they generate are an integral part of the cosmologies of many nonWestern cultures, constituting for each a kind of ontological skeleton upon which hangs the balance of culture, customs, and
lifestyle.
Throughout history, many societies have acknowledged consciousness as something more potent than we have in the
West-as a sieve or receiver and transmitter of communication
with forces, not always visible, other than ourselves. The contemporary Western tenet that we are alone in the universe, conversant
only with ourselves, is, in fact, a minority perspective, an anomaly.
· Across many epochs,o humans have reported making contact
with a multitude of gods, spirits, angels, fairies, demons, ghouls,
vampires, and sea monsters. All have been said to instruct, direct,
harass, or befriend humans with varying dispositions, motives, and
purposes. While many of these beings have seemed quite at home
on Earth, the majority made their visits from other habitats or dimensions. The sky, in particular, has always been a popular haven
for nonhumans and has come to represent extraterrestrial dimensionality rather opulently, especially as Earth's frontiers seemed,
in recent times, to have shrunk. As Ralph Noyes has noted, "we
used to populate the Earth with spirits and Gods. Now they have
been chased away and the sky is their haven" (Noyes 1990).
In Truk, located in the Marshall Islands, people have traditionally believed in an outer world that corresponds in some ways to
our modern conception of outer space. It is a world of mystery
and power, a world from which people in this world derived their
being. There was, moreover, a continual dialogue between the
people of this world and the inhabitants of the outer spirit world
(Goodenough 1986, p. 558). Likewise, Native American Hopi
were traditionally taught by the Kachinas, spiritlike beings from
other planets, who instructed them in agricultural techniques and
gave them philosophical and moral guidelines that have shaped
Hopi culture (Clark and Coleman 1975, p. 215). People in Ireland
believed that fairies or the gentle folk were not earthly, having
originated on other planets. Fairies often travel about the skies in
cloudlike aerial boats called "fairy boats" or "spectre ships"
(Rojcewicz 1991, p. 48 1 ) .
Mircea Eliade, the renowned mythologist, has amply documented the symbolic significance of the differentiation of sky and
Earth as illustrating both the separation and connection between
the human and spirit worlds. According to Eliade, "archaic myths
worldwide speak of an extremely close proximity that existed primordially between Heaven and Earth. In illo tempore, the gods
came down to Earth and mingled with men and men, for their
part, could go up to Heaven by climbing the mountain, tree
creeper or ladder, or might even be taken up by birds" (Eliade
1957' p. 59).
These ascension myths, Eliade says, these images of the earth
and the heavens being somehow joined, are found in many tribes
(including Australian, Pygmy, and Arctic) and have been elaborated by pastoral and sedentary cultures and transmitted right
down to the great urban cultures of Oriental antiquity. When
Heaven was abruptly separated from Earth, when the tree of the
Liana connecting Earth to Heaven was cut, or the mountain which
used to touch the sky was flattened out-then the paradisiac stage
was over and humans entered into their present condition (Eliade
1957' p. 59).
"In effect, all these myths ·show us primordial man enjoying a
beatitude, a spontaneity and freedom, which he has unfortunately
lost in consequence of the fall-that is, of what followed upon the •
mythical that caused the rupture between Heaven and Earth ...
Immortality, spontaneity and freedom; the possibility of ascension
into Heaven and easily meeting with the gods, friendship with the
animals and knowledge of their language. These freedoms and
abilities have been lost, as the result of a primordial event-the
fall of man, expressed as an ontological mutation of his own condition, as well as a cosmic schism" (Eliade 1957, p. 6 1 ). Only
special members of every culture, like shamans, could continue to
move between Heaven and Earth, between humans and the spirit
world.
The Koryaks of Siberia remember the mythical era of their
Great Raven, when humans could go up to Heaven without difficulty: in our days, they add, it is only shamans who are capable
of this. The Bakairi of Brazil think that, for the shaman, Heaven
is no higher than a house, so that he reaches it in the twinkling of
an eye (Eliade 1957, p. 65).
There are countless myths, tales, and legends concerning human or superhuman beings who fly away into Heaven and travel
freely between Heaven and Earth. Again, according to Eliade,
"the motifs of flight and ascension are attested to at every level
of the archaic cultures, as much in the rituals and mythologies of
the shamans and the ecstatics as in the myths and folklore of other
members of the society who make no pretense to be distinguished
by the intensity of their religious experience. A great many symbols and significations to do with spiritual life and above all, with
the power of intelligence, are connected with the images of
'flight' and 'wings' ; they all express a break with the universe of
everyday experience ... both transcendence and freedom are to
be obtained through the flight" (Eliade I 957, p. I 05).
It would seem that today's UFO abductees are continuing an
amply documented tradition of ascent and extraterrestrial communication. But alien abductions and their effects on abductees possess their own uniqueness. Peter Rojcewicz, a folklorist, has
compared the experience of. today's abductees or experiencers
with other aerial and abduction phenomena and alludes to the possibility of the existence of an intelligence, a spirit, an energy, a
consciousness behind UFO experiences and extraordinary encounters of all types, that adapts its form and appearance to fit the environment of the times (Rojcewicz 1991 ) .
Rojcewicz cites the long history of sightings of unusual aerial
phenomena, and beings or objects of light. In ancient times there
were sightings of "celestial cars, chariots that flew in the sky, flying palaces that shined and moved about in the sky ... There are
also many different descriptions of fiery shields in the sky, like
triangles. Fiery crosses were also seen over western Europe." He
also notes the presence of clouds or cloudy light surrounding unusual objects, including UFOs, as well as the spontaneous appearance of luminous religious images in the sky, frequently witnessed
by thousands of people. In the United States, as recently as the
last century, Americans witnessed ships-schooners and boatssailing in the sky (Rojcewicz 1992). Jerome Clark, after a careful
investigation of the airship sightings of the late 1890s, concluded
that the vehicles in the sky observed frequently in the United
States may have been related to contemporary UFOs but interpreted according to the technology and mythology of the time
(Clark 1991) .
According to Mario Pazzaglini, a psychologist who has been
interested in the abduction experience for a number of years, manifestations of a "UFO-associated" nature have been recorded for
the last ten thousand years, starting with an engraving of Ezekiel
in the Old Testament in which he depicts a vision containing
wheels, angels, light, and clouds (Pazzaglini 1992).
Unusual sky phenomena were also recorded by the Romans, the
Greeks in the fourth century, and in the Middle Ages. Sometimes
manifesting as stars, fires in the sky, crosses, lights, or beams, apparitions would often simply disappear or sometimes leave their
mark. Many of these sightings were viewed by thousands of people and interpreted as religious miracles. Often these phenomena
fit nicely into already existing spjritual beliefs held by the viewers.
The phenomenon of humans being transported into other di-:­
mensions also has a long history in most cultures. Tibetans have
long believed that humans could separate from the "etheric" or
"subtle" body and go traveling in an "out of body" capacity for
hours or days at a time. "They have experiences in different
places and then return." Tibetans distinguish between different
gradations of subtlety and grossness, or density of beings. "The
mind or consciousness produced by grosser matter cannot communicate with these subtle things . In some, you witness the
grosser level of mind subdued and the more subtle mind become
active. Then there's an opportunity, a chance to communicate with
or sometimes see another being who is more subtle than our mind
or body." (The Dalai Lama 1992) . Contemporary examples of
such entities in the West might be the "spirit guides" that are reported by many individuals. Descriptions of these spirits who appear to individuals or to intermediaries vary widely.
Rojcewicz includes UFO abductions within a wide range of
paranormal experiences, including near death experiences; powerful psychic, spiritual, mystical, and out-of-body experiences; and
encounters with a range of beings-such as witches, fairies,
werewolves-that often result, for an individual, in a substantive
transformation of values and orientation. The question of whether
and why these events occur, of course, remains unanswered. There
is much debate even about how to frame such questions.
The most commonly debated issue, whether abductions are really taking place, leads us to the center of questions about perception and levels of consciousness. The most glaring question is
whether there is any reality independent of consciousness. At the
level of personal consciousness, can we apprehend reality directly,
or are we by necessity bound by the restrictions of our five senses
and the mind that organizes our worldview? Is there a shared, collective consciousness that operates beyond our individual consciousness? If there is a collective consciousness, how is it
influenced, and what determines its content? Is UFO abduction a
product of this shared consciousness? If, as in some cultures, consciousness pervades all elements of the universe, then what function do events like UFO abductions and various mystical
experiences play in our psyches and in the rest of the cosmos?
These are questions that are not easily answered. Perhaps all we
can do at this point in time is to acknowledge the questions as we
listen to the experiences of those who have moved beyond our
culturally shared ideas of "reality." The UFO abduction experience, while unique in many respects, bears resemblance to other
dramatic, transformative experiences undergone by shamans, mystics, and ordinary citizens who have had encounters with the paranormal. In all of these experiential realms, the individual 's
ordinary consciousness is radically transformed. He or she is initiated into a non-ordinary state of being which results, ultimately,
in a reintegration of the self, an immersion or entrenchment into
states and/or knowledge not previously accessible. Sometimes the
process is brought on by illness or a traumatic event of some kind,
and sometimes the individual is simply pulled into a sequence of
states of being from which he or she emerges with new powers
and sensitivities. "During his initiation, the Shaman learns how to
penetrate into other dimensions of reality and maintain himself
there; his trials, whatever the nature of them, endow him with a
sensitivity that can perceive and integrate these new experiences
... through the strangely sharpened senses of the Shaman the sacred manifests itself' (Eliade 1957, p. 66). Like many abductees,
the initiate hones his new sensibilities in the service of wisdom
that can be used by hls people.
Revelation is not just accessible to those in pursuit of enlightenment, but it can knock on any door at any time. Earlier in thls
century, a Dr. Buche described what seems to be a certain kind of
archetypal experience: "He and two friends had spent the evening
reading Wordsworth, Keats, Browning and especially Whitman.
He was in a state of almost passive enjoyment. All at once, without warning of any kind, he found hlmself wrapped round, as it
were, by a flame-colored cloud . . . The next he knew, the light
was withln hlmself. Directly afterwards came upon rum a sense of
exaltation, of immense joyousness accompanied or followed by an
intellectual illumination impossible to describe. Into his brain
streamed one momentary lightning flash of Brahmic splendour,
leaving him thenceforth for always an aftertaste of Heaven"
(Eliade 1965, p. 69).
The experience of internalizing what is first perceived as external light happens frequently during mystical flashes or transcendental journeys that result in spiritual rebirth. Perhaps an analogy
might be drawn to UFO encounters where the abductee is initially
"struck by a beam of light," spies a bright ship, and is then taken
inside. Brazilian abductees in particular seem to have perceived illuminated clouds, frequently red in color, in association with
spaceships (Story 1980). ·
The mystic or the shaman, like the abductee, makes a pilgrimage, usually with ardor, to receive a new dimension of experience
or knowledge. This invoJves a rebirth whfch is sometimes very
distressing, a retracing of one's steps to a preternatural, primordial
arena to recondition the consciousness of the experiencer. The resulting psychlc chaos is a metaphor for the precosmogenic chaos,
amorphic yet penetrating, that the individual has been exposed to.
The abductee is a modern Dante, whose ontological underpinnings
are unraveled. Returned to his bed or his car after his time with
aliens, he struggles to reassemble his worldview. Most often, he
undertakes his journey alone, and many times his absence is not
even noticed by those to whom he might turn to corroborate his
coordinates.
Jacques Vallee, perhaps the most comprehensive cross-cultural
ufology investigator, discusses the international history of UFO
encounters in his two books Dimensions and Passport to
Magonia. Describing hundreds of sightings of strange sky-born
objects and their occupants across time, continents, and societies,
he cites the seemingly unexplainable presence of disks in the symbology of various civilizations-the Phoenicians and early Christians, for instance, associated them with communications between
· angels and God. He compares some of the phenomenology of a
UFO encounter with historical records of experiences of a mystical nature. Beams of light commonly play a role in both UFO and
out-of-body encounters (Vallee 1988, p. 34). As for the beings
themselves, Vallee draws many analogies to the worldwide sightings of nonhuman, shape-shifting, aerially adept beings throughout
history. These beings appear to mankind in thousands of different
guises; they possess extraordinary powers and frequently aim to
partake of and/or take away something belonging to humans, desiring to communicate with or simply play tricks on them. He
concludes, 'The UFO occupants, like the elves of ol<L are not extraterrestrials. They are denizens of another reality" (1988, p. 96).
Vallee believes that abductees' interaction with aliens is a part of
"an age-old and worldwide myth that has shaped our belief structures, our scientific expectations, and our view of ourselves"
( 1988, p. 99). He writes, "The same power attributed to saucer
people was once the exclusive property of fairies" (1988, p. 1 34).
Vallee draws parallels between religious apparitions, the fairyfaith, the reports of dwarf-like beings with supernatural powers,
the airship tales in the United States in the last century, and the
present stories of UFO landings ( 1988, p. 140). He speculates
broadly:
Or should we hypothesize that an advanced race somewhere
in the universe and sometime in the future has been showing us
three-dimensional space operas for the last two thousand years,
in an attempt to guide our civilization? If so; do they deserve
our congratulations? . . . Are we dealing instead with a parallel
universe, another dimension, where there are human races living, and where we may go at our expense, never to return to
the present? Are these races only semihuman, so that in order
to maintain contact with us, they need cross-breeding with men
and women of our planet? Is this the origin of the many tales
and legends where genetics plays a great role: the symbolism of
the Virgin in occultism and religion, the fairy tales involving
human midwives and changelings, the sexual overtones of the
flying saucer reports, the biblical stories of intermarriage between the Lord's angels and terrestrial women, whose offspring
were giants? From that mysterious universe, are higher beings
projecting obj ects that can materialize and dematerialize at
will? Are the UFOs "windows" rather than "objects"? There is
nothing to support these assumptions, and yet, in view of the
historical continuity of the phenomenon, alternatives are hard to
find, unless we deny the reality of all the facts, as our peace of
mind would indeed prefer ( 1988, p. 143-44 ).
Where facts are lean, inconsistent, or disparate, human beings, ·Vallee assures us, are quick to fin· in the gaps. "Because many observations of UFO phenomena appear self -consistent and at the
same time irreconcilable with scientific knowledge, a logical vacuum has been created that human imagination tries to fill with
fantasy" ( 1988, p. 1 45).
Ultimately, Vallee prescribes our remaining open to learning
from phenomena that we do not yet understand. 'These unexplained observations need not represent a visitation from space
visitors, but something even more interesting: a window toward
undiscovered dimensions of our environment" (1988, p. 203). "I
believe that the UFO phenomenon represents evidence for other
dimensions beyond spacetime; the UFOs may not come from ordinary space, but from a multiverse which is all around us, and of
which we have stubbornly refused to consider the disturbing reality in spite of the evidence available to us for centuries" ( 1988,
p. 253).

THE UFO ABDUCTION PHENOMENON WORLDWIDE
Another question concerns the worldwide distribution of abductions;or reports of the phenomenon, which may be quite a different matter. UFO abductions have been reported and collected most
frequently in Western countries or countries dominated by Western culture and values, but our investigations are revealing that the
phenomenon, in its familiar form, occurs among native peoples in
North and South America and in Africa
The first publication of an abduction case took place in Brazil,
involving the reported abduction of the son of a rancher, Antonio
Villas-Boas, in 1957. Reports of UFO sightings worldwide, however, far outnumber accounts of actual abductions. The most comprehensive guide to abductions overseas was put together in 1987
by Thomas Bullard, a folklori st at the University of Indiana
(Bullard 1987). Bullard's lists reported abductions from seventeen
countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada,
Chile, England, Finland, France, Poland, South Africa, the Soviet
Union, Spain, Uruguay, and West Germany.
The United States leads the way in sheer numbers of reported
abductions, with England and Brazil following behind, perhaps
because of the availability of practicing therapists working with
abductees in these countries. In illustration of this point, China
boasts the largest number of witnesses of a single UFO
sighting. On August 24, 1981, one million Chinese saw a spiral shaped UFO simultaneously (Chiang 1993)-but there is no record of any follow-up questioning of individual witnesses.
The therapeutic exploration of abduction experiences is, however, gradually catching hold. In May 1993, Germany's second
largest television station presented a forty-five-minute documentary about the abduction phenomenon which won Germany's
highest television award. Even accounts of UFO sightings are,
throughout the world, shrouded in secrecy. Spain's Ministry of
Defense UFO files were released in 1992. These contain, mostly,
reports of sightings by air force personnel. Much work remains to
be done in persuading other nations similarly to open up classified
files on the subject.
In some countries, where people hold all sorts of beliefs in supernatural beings, abduction experiences are confused or simply
connected with other visitations. Cynthia Hind, a researcher from
South Africa reports, "Their reactions are as perhaps Westerners
would react to ghosts; not necessarily terrified (or not always so)
but certainly wary of what they see" (Hind 1993, p. 1 7).
Abductees overseas seem to have contact with a greater variety
of entities than Americans. These range from tiny men to tall,
hooded beings, and include naked individuals of both sexes and
humanoid beings with every manner or shape of head, feet, and
hands. A Dutch couple recently described their UFO visitors as
being tiny and appearing in rainbow hues-green, orange, and
purple (personal communication, September 1992).
But universal properties of the abduction experience remain.
Most often, abductees everywhere are compellingly drawn toward
a powerful light, often while they are driving or asleep in their
beds. Invariably, they are later unable to account for a "lost" period of time, and they frequently bear physical and psychological
scars of their experience. These range from nightmares and anxiety to chronic nervous agitation, depression, and even psychosis, to actual physical scars-puncture and incision marks,
scrapes, bums, and sores. Some encounters are traumatizing, mysterious, even seemingly sinister. Others seem to bear a healing and
educational intent. Often abductees report they are told or warned
by the beings not to tell about their experiences.
Even less well documented than the actual abductions are the
consequences of the experience. In working with abductees, Gilda
Moura, a Brazilian psychologist, reports on the paranormal abilities ll)any Brazilian abductees experience after an encounter.
These include increased telepathic abilities, clairvoyance, visions,
and the receiving of spiritual messages which are often concerned
with world ecology, the future of humankind, and social justice.
Many abductees decide to change their profession after their experience (Moura 1995).
It is likely that with the publicizing of therapeutic and hypnosis
techniques currently being pioneered in the United States, much
more information about abduction experiences overseas will be
available in coming years; for the rest of the world certainly does
not lack awareness of the UFO phenomenon, as is evidenced by
the proliferation of UFO bureaus, offices, and research organizations abroad.
MODERN-DAY ABDUCTION EXPERI ENCES
With the exception of the 1957 Vil las-Boas case, referred to
above, the modern history of abductions begins with the experience of Barney and Betty Hill in
September 1961 (Fuller 1966).
The Hills, a stable, respectable interracial couple living in New
Hampshire, had suffered from disturbing symptoms for more than
two years when they reluctantly consulted Boston psychiatrist
Benjamin Simon. Barney was an insomniac and Betty had frequent nightmares. Both were so persistently anxious that it became intolerable for them to continue their lives without looking
into disturbing repercussions of the September night in which they
could not account for two hours during the return journey from a
holiday in Montreal. Except for the distresses related to the incident they described, Dr. Simon reported no psychiatric illness.
The Hi lis reported that on the night of September 19, 1961 ,
they observed an unusual flying object occupied by small, gray
humanoid beings with unusual eyes. Before this they had noticed
an erratically moving light and then a strange craft. With binoculars Barney had been able to see the creatures inside the craft. The
Hills were amnesiac about what happened to them during the
missing hours until undergoing repeated hypnosis sessions with
Dr. Simon. In their meetings with him, Dr. Simon instructed the
Hills not to tell each other details of the memories that were
emerging. After being taken from their car the Hills said they
were led by the beings against their wills onto a craft. Each reported that on the craft they were placed on a table and subjected
to detailed medical-like exarrtinations with taking of skin and hair
"samples." A needle was inserted into Betty's abdomen and a
"pregnancy test" performed. Researchers have reported recently
that Barney said that a sperm sample was taken from him, a fact
that was originally withheld by him and John Fuller, who later
wrote about their case, because it was too humiliating at the time
for Barney to admit (Jacobs 1992). The Hills said that the beings
communicated with them telepathically, nonverbally, "as if it were
in English." The Hills were "told to" forget what had happened.
Despite Dr. Simon's belief that the Hills had experienced some
sort of shared dream or fantasy, a kind of folie a deux, they persisted in their conviction that these events really happened, and
that they had not communicated the corroborating details to each
other during the investigation of their symptoms. Barney, who
died in 1969 at the age of forty-six, had been particularly reluctant
to believe in the reality of the experience lest he appear irrational.
"I wish I could think it was an hallucination," he told Dr. Simon
when the doctor pressed him. But in the end Barney concluded,
"we had seen and been a part of something different than anything I had seen before," and "these things did happen to me."
Betty, who continues to speak publicly about her experience, also
believes in the reality of these events. In 1975 a film about the
Hill case, The UFO Incident, starring James Earl Jones as Barney,
was shown on television in the United States.
A number of books and articles documented abduction experiences by other individuals in the years following the Hills's testimony (Lorenzen and Lorenzen 1976; Lorenzen and Lorenzen
1977 ; Haisell 1978; Fowler 1979; Rogo 1980; Druffel and Rogo
1980; Bullard 1987, pp. 1-15; Clark 1990, p. 2). It has been the
pioneering research of New York artist and sculptor Budd
Hopkins, however, over almost two decades with hundreds of
abductees, that has established the essential consistency of the abduction phenomenon. Hopkins's first book, Missing Tzme, published in 1981, documented the unaccounted-for time periods and
associated symptoms that indicate that abduction experiences
might have taken place, as well as the characteristic details of
such experiences (Hopkins 198 1). Hopkins also found that abduction experiences were possibly associated with previously unexplainable small cuts, body scars, and scoop marks; the narratives
even suggested that small objects or "implants" may have been
inserted in victims' noses, legs, and other body parts. In his second book, Intruders, published in 1987, Hopkins defined the sexual and reproductive episodes that have come to be associated
with the abduction phenomenon (Hopkins 1987). Temple University historian David Jacobs has further refined the basic reported
pattern of an abduction experience (Jacobs 1992). Jacobs identifies primary phenomena such as manual or instrument examination, staring, and urological-gynecological procedures; secondary
events, including machine examination, visualization, and child
presentation; and ancillary events, among them miscellaneous additional physical, mental, and sexual activities and procedures.
Polls of the prevalence of the UFO abduction phenomenon in
the United States, including a survey of nearly six thousand
Americans conducted by the Roper organization between July and
September 1991 (Hopkins, Jacobs, and Westrum 1991) suggest
that from several hundred thousand to several million Americans
may have had abduction or abduction-related experiences. The
Roper poll has been justly criticized on the grounds that the indicators of possible abduction used--such as seeing unusual lights,
missing time, or a feeling of flying-may not in fact actually
mean that an abduction has occurred. But an even more serious
difficulty in estimating the prevalence of abductions lies in the
fact that we do not know what an abduction really is-the extent,
for example, to which it represents an event in the physical world
or to which it is an unusual subjective experience with physical
manifestations. A still greater problem resides in the fact that
memory in relation to abduction experiences behaves rather
strangely. As in the cases, for example, of Ed (chapter 3) or Arthur (chapter 1 5) the memory of an abduction may be outside of
consciousness until triggered many years later by another experience or situation that becomes associated with the original event.
The experiencer in a situation such as this could be counted on
the negative side of the ledger before the triggering experience
and on the positive side after it.
None of this work, in my view, has come to terms with the potential implications of the abduction phenomenon for the expansion of human consciousness or the meaning for our world of this
apparent opening to a mysterious reality that may be beyond the
manifest physical world.

THE PROGRAM FOR EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE RESEARCH (PEER)

The Program for Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER) is a nonprofit research and education group dedicated to a deeper understanding of the varieties of extraordinary experience. We are currently exploring the phenomenon
commonly known as "alien abduction" and the larger context in wruch to
place these experiences. PEER was founded in 1993 by John E. Mack, M.D.,
as a project under the auspices of the Center for Psychology and Social
Change, an affiliate of the Department of Psychiatry at The Cambridge Hospital, Harvard Medical School.
PEER works with individuals having these experiences and the mental
health and academic communities to foster an understanding of anomalous experiences, develop a network of support and education, consider the implications of the phenomenon, and disseminate information to the general public.
PEER is interested in exploring and documenting experiences worldwide. We
are happy to hear from individuals who would like to provide us with information or who have inquiries about our program. All information will be kept
confidential. Please do not send original documents or materials that you wish
to have returned.
If you would like to write to us, please include the form below with your
