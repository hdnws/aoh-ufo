        "text_source": "In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

        "text_target": "There are those individuals in positions of power in commerce and government who are already in liaison with the Intervention. Their numbers will grow, and their strength and influence will grow if the Intervention is not stopped and if public education cannot be successfully generated. The next group of individuals who have been targeted are leaders of your religious organizations. Those amongst them who are deemed receptive and cooperative will be targeted and ideas and information will flow into their minds until such time as a direct encounter can be arranged. What will be offered to each of them is the promise that their particular religious organization and teaching will become predominant in a new world order. And even beyond that, it will be promised to each of them that their religious teaching, being greater than the others, will be able to extend beyond the world and have influence in the Greater Community itself. What devout religious leader could resist this temptation to have their tradition grow and extend even beyond the confines of this world? Not all leaders will be contacted. Only those who are deemed to be receptive and cooperative and who could become sympathetic and functional within the Intervention itself. Interventions are part of your own human history. We understand that such things have happened countless times. As greater nations attempt to overtake weaker ones, they seek to seduce the leaders of those weaker groups and nations with promises of power and authority and gifts of technology, mere trinkets. How effective this has been. Yet this is not unique to your world. It happens throughout the universe. Leaders of your religious organizations will be given the promise of pre-eminence in your world. Even their beliefs will be acknowledged, yet this is but deception again. The visitors do not care about your religions. They believe they are only the folly and the superstitions of humanity. Having no religion of their own that you could possibly recognize and understand, they will seek to use yours in order to garner your allegiance to them. The Collectives believe this is entirely ethical, for they believe that humanity will destroy the world without their Intervention. This is of course untrue, but this is their belief. And they feel that such methods are needed to secure the end that they are attempting to achieve. The Collectives justify these behaviors because they believe in the superiority of their race and in the necessity of their mission here in the world. Their thought is, Why let the natives ruin the world when we can run it for them and we can teach them the great value and benefit of our collective community? This is why you must not view the Intervention in a superstitious manner. The visitors are not angels, and they are not demons. They are driven by the same needs that drive humanity, and they will employ many of the same techniques that humanity has attempted to employ, though on a far lesser scale, in order to achieve their goals. Next, the inducement will be focused upon two distinct groups of individuals. Actually, these are not groups of individuals, but really classifications, of individuals. The first are those who are considered psychic and sensitive. The inducement here is to validate their sensitivity and to induce them into the collective mind of the Intervention itself. Here these individuals will be encouraged to support the Intervention, and their own beliefs regarding the frailties and the sinfulness of humanity will be encouraged. And their hope that some greater power from beyond the world will come to rescue humanity from its own demise will be greatly encouraged. Here it will be taught to them that they are part of a greater association of life that is demonstrated by the Intervention itself. Here their religious views and aspirations will be encouraged but directed towards the Collectives. These individuals will be told to trust in the extraterrestrial presence that is in the world, that it is here to uplift humanity, to transform humanity, and to rescue humanity from its own errors. They will be encouraged to become its representatives, to become its speakers, to inspire others to give their faith and their trust to the extraterrestrial presence and to become part of this movement in consciousness, this great evolutionary change that is occurring in their midst. Yet these individuals, without knowing the real nature or intentions of the Intervention, will unwittingly become its speakers and its representatives. Having become part of the visitors' Pacification Program, these people will now pacify others and bring them to the Intervention. So while the visitors seek liaison with individuals in positions of power in government and religion, they also seek to establish emissaries throughout the human population. For those sensitive individuals who cannot become receptive to and cooperative with the Intervention, their skills and abilities will be thwarted and offset. If such individuals begin to gain an insight into the real nature of the Intervention, they can become the target of real mental disruption. In addition, amongst the sensitives and the psychics, there will be a search for those few individuals living in the world today who have an inborn and intuitive awareness of the depositories. The search for these individuals is underway. The visitors understand that the key to human allegiance is the quest for power, wealth and spiritual fulfillment. Here people will operate against their own best interests if they believe that their activities are ordained and supported by a greater power. We have spoken of this already in our first series of discourses. Yet again we must elaborate on this point. Perhaps you will see those who claim to be psychic and sensitive being supportive and encouraging people to trust and to believe in the presence of the visitors, believing that the visitors represent a spiritual awareness, a spiritual force, even evolution itself. The visitors will tell them, Look, we have no war. We live in peace and cooperation. You have not achieved these things. Therefore, trust that we are able to give them to you and teach you the ways of cooperation and teach you how to live in peace, harmony and equanimity. Who amongst the idealistic can resist such a temptation, having lost faith in the human spirit? Having disavowed human institutions to a certain extent, they now look to the heavens for help, for inspiration and for salvation itself. And when they are taken by the visitors or contacted by the visitors, such predispositions put them in the perfect position to become receptive to the Intervention and to become emissaries for the Intervention. Those who will not cooperate will be given confusing information. They can even be tormented mentally unless they call upon the power of the Unseen Ones, the Angelic Presence, to help them. And they must gain a strong position of resistance to the Intervention with a real understanding of its motives. Our words will give them strength and encouragement. This in part is why our message is so urgently needed in the world today. The next group who will be contacted will be those who are zealous representatives of their own religious traditions. Their fundamentalism is very close in many respects to the philosophy and the mentality of the Collectives. The Collectives support only one view of reality and only one view of community, and they hold this in reverence almost to the point of it being a religious emphasis. Those people who are zealous, especially those who are filled with anger and resentment against the world and against those who they see oppose them, will become prime candidates to espouse a cooperation with the Collectives and the destruction of those who stand against the Collectives. This is a very difficult and dangerous situation, for the visitors will use human allegiance and their human emissaries to carry out their destructive activities in the world. It will not be the visitors who will destroy those who will not and cannot cooperate. It will be the visitors' human counterparts, their human representatives, who will carry out such destruction. In this way, the real nature and purpose of the Intervention remains hidden and such acts of violence will simply be attributed to human error and to human violence and demonstrate the need for the Intervention. For the visitors again will say, Look at these terrible acts of violence! We are not violent. We do not come with weapons of war. We do not destroy you. This is the result of human ignorance and human depravity. We will teach you how to outgrow all of these things. So even the violence that is perpetrated by the Intervention will be used by the visitors to support their superiority and to contribute to the illusion that they themselves do not use deception, manipulation or force to gain their advantage. Clearly, there are individuals in your world who are very zealous in representing their religious beliefs and aspirations. The Unseen Ones have told us much about this, and we of course have seen this in many other worlds. It is not unique to humankind. Yet it is a form of blind passion, and blind passion fueled by anger and hostility becomes a consuming force for the individual, a force which can be highly manipulated and is vulnerable to usurpation by the Intervention itself. Such zealous people will rally a movement of strict adherence and will draw out those who oppose such a strict adherence. Violence will be wrought upon the unbelievers, and they shall be cast aside. In this way, through the eyes of the Intervention, those who oppose the Intervention and those who cannot willingly support it will be identified and will be sorted out amongst the many people who dwell in your world. And the sifting will happen at the level of human interaction. In this way, the visitors will recognize their true adversaries and their potential adversaries. And having gained now a network of human representatives who are zealous in supporting and advancing their religious causes, the Intervention will use these individuals as the medium through which violence will be perpetrated. All the while, the visitors will remain seemingly above and beyond such activity and behavior. You may stop at this point and wonder, Well, how can such things occur? This seems so extreme! This seems so negative, so awful! But for anyone who has studied human history, you will see demonstrations of all of these things we are speaking of-religious manipulation, interbreeding, violence wrought upon adversaries, particularly in situations where native populations are encouraged to accept and to receive their new visitors. It is far easier to govern one who believes in your cause and is cooperative than it is one who is simply being subjugated. Humanity has great strength to throw off the shackles of subjugation. And so the Intervention will seek to use these inducements to gain as much cooperation and as much belief in their presence and in their cause as is possible. They will employ individuals in positions of power, those who have great sensitivities and psychic abilities and those who are zealous representatives of their religious traditions, to foster and generate such cooperation. For the vast majority of people in your world, the Intervention will be unknown and completely hidden. Yet for those who become aware of it, either because they have been taken, or because they have witnessed evidence of the Intervention in your world, these individuals will either be encouraged to believe and to support the Intervention or they will be cast aside and tormented by it. Already, there are individuals in your world, we understand, who have been cast aside and who are tormented, who have seen and felt and recognized things that they cannot incorporate into their understanding. Finding no compassion amongst their human fellows, they deteriorate into depression and into self-disassociation.",
        "text_source": "CULTURE SHOCK  Our own galaxy-one of an infinite number-is comprised of several hundred billion stars, and statistically, it is probable that life has evolved on some planetary systems to the extent that space travel and colonization are commonplace. In assuming that the lifetime of advanced civilizations is ten million years, science writer Ian Ridpath has speculated that there could be as many as one million advanced civilizations like ourselves or more advanced in our galaxy, and surmises that the main interest of an old and advanced civilization may be in the developing creatures of the Galaxy, as the anthropologists of the Western world are increasingly fascinated by the stone- age societies that remain on Earth.23 Dr. Bernard Oliver, of NASA's SETI project, has remarked on the possibility that an interconnecting galactic community of advanced cultures already exists. Although some astronomers and exobiologists concur that we may have been visited in the distant past, and are certain to be visited in the future, present-day visits are out of the question. The logic of such reasoning escapes me. The fact that contact has been restricted to relatively few people so far, rather than being on a wide scale, may be for a number of sound reasons-not least of which the cultural shock that would be engendered. For us this could hold more danger than the combination of nuclear arms, energy shortages, overpopulation, dwindling resources and pollution, believes Edward Ashpole, author of The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Some visitors may not want us to know what they are doing here, and in any event, can probably go about their business with none of us any the wiser (particularly if they are able to function in another dimension!). It is therefore likely that those who have been contacted are fed a certain amount of false information. Disinformation could well be an inevitable consequence of contact. Others may be so advanced, technologically, culturally, and spiritually , that contact with our relatively retarded species might be seen as disadvantageous to both parties. In this regard, the comments made by Daniel Fry's alleged extraterrestrial friend in 1949 are worth recounting. We will never attempt to thrust either our knowledge or our culture upon your people, he said, and we will never offer it unless there is substantial evidence that they desire it, and that it would be advantageous to them. There is certainly no such evidence at the present time. It is also true that the purpose of this visit is not entirely philanthropic, since there are some materials upon your planet which we could use to the advantage of both our peoples; materials which you have in abundance but which are rather scarce elsewhere in this solar system. While the use of some of these materials would be of assistance to us, our services to your people will not be made contingent upon such use. Any knowledge or aid which we can give will be freely offered. . . . If we took steps to force the acceptance of our reality upon their consciousness, Fry was told, about 30 percent of the people would consider us as gods, and could attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their welfare. This is a responsibility we could not be permitted to assume, even if we were able to discharge it, which of course, we are not. Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe. National security policy-makers might argue for classification of the contact and the information received. Some scholars, particularly those personally involved in the first contact, might be equally possessive about the information and the channel, especially if they distrusted governments and held a low opinion of the general population. As Bob Lazar stresses, although advanced alien technology could be put to use for the benefit of all, the same technology could equally well be used for destructive purposes, such as the construction of a superbomb. Michael Michaud foresees another problem relating to the acquisition of alien technology: that it could undermine our spirit of invention and independent initiative, forcing massive readjustment and unemployment, and threatening existing economic institutions. I take the view that those few within governments who are aware of the situation are acting in our best interests by gradually presenting the information in such a way that it will lessen the political, economic, religious, and psychological shock. But eventually, the ultimate secret will be revealed. The truth about UFOs may be painful for us to face, and this might provide a continuing rationale for the government to maintain secrecy, says the astrophysicist Dr. Brian O'Leary. But the truth will and must be known eventually. Continuing our denials and fears, in my opinion, [is] only adding to the problem. We are all in this together. The evidence available to me suggests that we are being visited by a number of extraterrestrial groups.31 Some could be here for less than benign purposes, others perhaps visiting as anthropologists or even tourists. But it seems logical that some groups, motivated by a vested interest in the survival of our planet and its species, have established contact with a relatively small number of our people, partly perhaps to lend us a helping hand as we reach, falteringly, toward the stars. Let us hope that the advantages of contact will ultimately outweigh the disadvantages, leading to a more complete and profound understanding of our place in the universal scheme."

        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

        "text_target": "The Allies Briefings were given to the author over a span of 19 years. They offer perspective and vision into a complex subject which, despite decades of mounting evidence, continues to baffle researchers. Yet this perspective is not romantic, speculative or idealistic in its approach to this subject. To the contrary, it is bluntly realistic and uncompromising to the point where it may be quite challenging, even to a reader who is well versed in this subject. Therefore, to receive what these Briefings have to offer requires that you suspend, for a moment at least, many of the beliefs, assumptions and questions that you may have about extraterrestrial Contact and even about how these Briefings were received. The contents of these Briefings are like a message in a bottle sent here from beyond the world. Thus, we should not be so concerned about the bottle but about the message itself. To truly understand this challenging message, we must confront and question many of the prevailing assumptions and tendencies regarding the possibility and the reality of Contact. These include:  denial; hopeful expectation; misinterpreting the evidence to affirm our beliefs; wanting and expecting salvation from the visitors; believing that ET technology will save us; feeling hopeless and submissive to what we assume is a superior force; demanding government disclosure but not ET disclosure; condemning human leaders and institutions while maintaining unquestioned acceptance of the visitors; assuming that because they have not attacked or invaded us, they must be here for our good; assuming that advanced technology equals advanced ethics and spirituality; believing that this phenomenon is a mystery when in fact it is a comprehensible event; believing that ETs in some way have claim to humanity and to this planet; and believing that humanity is irredeemable and cannot make it on its own. The Allies Briefings challenge such assumptions and tendencies and explode many of the myths we currently have about who is visiting us and why they are here. The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions.",

Some visitors may not want us to know what they are doing here, and in any event, can probably go about their business with none of us any the wiser (particularly if they are able to function in another dimension!). It is therefore likely that those who have been contacted are fed a certain amount of false information. Disinformation could well be an inevitable consequence of contact. Others may be so advanced, technologically, culturally, and spiritually , that contact with our relatively retarded species might be seen as disadvantageous to both parties. In this regard, the comments made by Daniel Fry's alleged extraterrestrial friend in 1949 are worth recounting. We will never attempt to thrust either our knowledge or our culture upon your people, he said, and we will never offer it unless there is substantial evidence that they desire it, and that it would be advantageous to them. There is certainly no such evidence at the present time. It is also true that the purpose of this visit is not entirely philanthropic, since there are some materials upon your planet which we could use to the advantage of both our peoples; materials which you have in abundance but which are rather scarce elsewhere in this solar system. While the use of some of these materials would be of assistance to us, our services to your people will not be made contingent upon such use. Any knowledge or aid which we can give will be freely offered. . . . If we took steps to force the acceptance of our reality upon their consciousness, Fry was told, about 30 percent of the people would consider us as gods, and could attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their welfare. This is a responsibility we could not be permitted to assume, even if we were able to discharge it, which of course, we are not. Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe. National security policy-makers might argue for classification of the contact and the information received. Some scholars, particularly those personally involved in the first contact, might be equally possessive about the information and the channel, especially if they distrusted governments and held a low opinion of the general population. As Bob Lazar stresses, although advanced alien technology could be put to use for the benefit of all, the same technology could equally well be used for destructive purposes, such as the construction of a superbomb. Michael Michaud foresees another problem relating to the acquisition of alien technology: that it could undermine our spirit of invention and independent initiative, forcing massive readjustment and unemployment, and threatening existing economic institutions. I take the view that those few within governments who are aware of the situation are acting in our best interests by gradually presenting the information in such a way that it will lessen the political, economic, religious, and psychological shock. But eventually, the ultimate secret will be revealed. The truth about UFOs may be painful for us to face, and this might provide a continuing rationale for the government to maintain secrecy, says the astrophysicist Dr. Brian O'Leary. But the truth will and must be known eventually. Continuing our denials and fears, in my opinion, [is] only adding to the problem. We are all in this together. The evidence available to me suggests that we are being visited by a number of extraterrestrial groups.31 Some could be here for less than benign purposes, others perhaps visiting as anthropologists or even tourists. But it seems logical that some groups, motivated by a vested interest in the survival of our planet and its species, have established contact with a relatively small number of our people, partly perhaps to lend us a helping hand as we reach, falteringly, toward the stars. Let us hope that the advantages of contact will ultimately outweigh the disadvantages, leading to a more complete and profound understanding of our place in the universal scheme."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

        "text_target": "______________________  We feel that it is important, given the information that we have provided thus far, to respond to questions that must surely arise regarding our reality and the significance of the messages that we have come to give. ~  Given the lack of hard evidence, why should people believe what you are telling them about the Intervention? First, there must be great evidence concerning the visitation to your world. We have been told that this is the case. Yet we have also been told by the Unseen Ones that people do not know how to understand the evidence and that they give it their own meaning-a meaning that they prefer to give it, a meaning that provides comfort and reassurance for the most part. We are certain that there is adequate evidence to verify that the Intervention is occurring in the world today if one takes the time to look and to investigate this matter. The fact that your governments or religious leaders do not reveal such things does not mean that such a great event is not occurring in your midst. ~  How can people know that you are real? Regarding our reality, we cannot demonstrate our physical presence to you, and so you must discern the meaning and the import of our words. At this point, it is not merely a matter of belief. It requires a greater recognition, a Knowledge, a resonance. The words we speak we believe are true, but that does not assure that they can be received as such. We cannot control the response to our message. There are people who require more evidence than can possibly be given. For others, such evidence will not be necessary, for they will feel an inner confirmation. In the meantime, perhaps we remain a controversy, and yet we hope and we trust that our words can be considered seriously and that the evidence that does exist, which is substantial, can be gathered and understood by those who are willing to give this their effort and their focus in life. From our perspective, there is no greater problem, challenge and opportunity to receive your attention. Therefore, you are at the beginning of a new understanding. This does require faith and self-reliance. Many will reject our words simply because they do not believe that we could possibly exist. Others perhaps will think that we are part of some manipulation that is being cast upon the world. We cannot control these responses. We can only reveal our message and our presence in your life, however removed that presence may be. It is not our presence here that is of paramount importance, but the message that we have come to reveal and the greater perspective and understanding that we can provide for you. Your education must begin somewhere. All education begins with the desire to know. We hope that through our discourses we can gain at least part of your confidence in order to begin to reveal what we are here to offer. ~  What do you have to say to those who view the Intervention as a positive thing? We understand, first of all, the expectation that all forces from the heavens are related to your spiritual understanding, traditions and fundamental beliefs. The idea that there is prosaic life in the universe is a challenge to these fundamental assumptions. From our perspective and given the experience of our own cultures, we understand these expectations. In the distant past, we maintained them ourselves. And yet we had to relinquish them in facing the realities of Greater Community life and the meaning of visitation. You live in a great physical universe. It is full of life. This life represents countless manifestations and also represents the evolution of intelligence and spiritual awareness at every level. What this means is that what you will encounter in the Greater Community encompasses almost every possibility. However, you are isolated and do not yet travel in space. And even if you had the capability to reach another world, the universe is vast, and no one has gained the ability to go from one end of the galaxy to the other with any kind of speed. Therefore, the physical universe remains enormous and incomprehensible. No one has mastered its laws. No one has conquered its territories. No one can claim complete dominance or control. Life has a great humbling effect in this way. Even far beyond your borders this is true. You should then come to expect that you will meet intelligences representing forces for good, forces for ignorance and those who are more neutral regarding you. However, in the realities of Greater Community travel and exploration, emerging races such as your own will, almost without exception, encounter resource explorers, collectives and those seeking advantage for themselves as their first contact with Greater Community life. Regarding the positive interpretation of visitation, part of this is human expectation and the natural desire to welcome a good outcome and to seek help from the Greater Community for the problems that humanity has not been able to resolve on its own. It is normal to expect such things, particularly when you are considering that your visitors have greater capabilities than do you. However, a large part of the problem in interpreting the great visitation has to do with the will and the agenda of the visitors themselves. For they are encouraging people everywhere to view their presence here as wholly beneficial to humanity and to its needs.",
        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

        "text_source": "CULTURE SHOCK  Our own galaxy-one of an infinite number-is comprised of several hundred billion stars, and statistically, it is probable that life has evolved on some planetary systems to the extent that space travel and colonization are commonplace. In assuming that the lifetime of advanced civilizations is ten million years, science writer Ian Ridpath has speculated that there could be as many as one million advanced civilizations like ourselves or more advanced in our galaxy, and surmises that the main interest of an old and advanced civilization may be in the developing creatures of the Galaxy, as the anthropologists of the Western world are increasingly fascinated by the stone- age societies that remain on Earth.23 Dr. Bernard Oliver, of NASA's SETI project, has remarked on the possibility that an interconnecting galactic community of advanced cultures already exists. Although some astronomers and exobiologists concur that we may have been visited in the distant past, and are certain to be visited in the future, present-day visits are out of the question. The logic of such reasoning escapes me. The fact that contact has been restricted to relatively few people so far, rather than being on a wide scale, may be for a number of sound reasons-not least of which the cultural shock that would be engendered.

        "text_target": "We cannot answer these questions. Only you can answer them. We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves. No one in the world is prepared to give you this counsel, for how could anyone know? It takes your allies, the Allies of Humanity, to provide this perspective and this orientation. Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings.",
        "text_source": "Our research project began in August, 1995. Since that time we have traveled a road filled with twists, turns, embankments, cliffs and ambushes. There were times when we were encouraged and uplifted and at other times discouraged. However, I did not give in to these feelings. This in part was due to my burning desire for knowledge and the encouragement of friends who urged me on. One of these was Whitley Strieber, who constantly pointed out the importance of the work we were engaged in. Another person who inspired me was my cousin Ken Ring. The primary goal I pursued was to marry hard science to a subject regarded by many as a fringe area, to say the least and more often was regarded as pseudoscience. In looking back on our endeavors, I can say without reservation that in my opinion, this goal was accomplished. However, because of unhelpful comments from the public at large and the armchair scientific community, it became necessary to restrict our communication on the internet. Many times, outside of public view, I found information exchanges occurring among scientists who were debating portions of the data we brought forward. One such debate took place after our July 1997 press conference in Roswell. Several of the scientists who saw the raw data supplied by Dr. VernonClark had questions about the actual mathematics involved in the Silicon isotopic ratios. As it turned out one of the people who made these calculations had erred. The net result was a new calculation which provided even a greater deviant from the terrestrial isotopes than previously recorded. Closing these debates to the general public made this exchange between true scientists possible. The increasing interest generated by the scientific community is what we feel is needed to have our research published in a major scientific journal. We look forward to this occurring in the very near future. Since our approach to ufology ultimately involves the scientific study of physical evidence, our ultimate goal seems possible to many of our colleagues: actually capturing one or more of the elusive beings which are entering our environment. I feel that any creature which operates in our three-dimensional world has habits. If this is correct, these habits can be recorded, correlated, studied and ultimately used to capture these beings. Progress in our investigations is directly related to our ability to pay for the necessary work. Our efforts to raise funding have been diverse. Among numerous avenues, we believe the entertainment industry may provide the much-needed capital to continue our endeavors. We are looking forward to a one-hour television production based on our work which we hope will be shown world-wide. If this comes about, the funds generated will go directly into our research and allow it to continue without interruption. It has been made very clear to us that there is a large amount of physical evidence being kept secret. Many of the individuals with this evidence have deep fears of reprisal from government agencies. Because we have taken the scientific approach to this subject, we have been able to dampen some of their fears. In addition, our policy has always been to accommodate the requests of anyone who wishes to turn physical evidence over to us. If they request anonymity, we are always happy to comply. One of the prime examples concerned the piece of material believed to be from the Roswell crash site. In dealing with the supplier of this material, we demonstrated that we would live up to the agreement we had made with him. We did not release one iota of information about him. Because we demonstrated our sincerity, he trusted us with additional information. Another of our goals is to extend our research to an international level. We look forward to the time when we can arrange for the performance of surgical procedures in such countries as Brazil, England, Mexico, Japan, Ecuador, Australia and Puerto Rico. I would like to give assistance without charge to the people of these countries. We want to help with their physiological and emotional needs. During our travels we began to realize that the abduction phenomenon is a world-wide issue. Its effects seem to vary with respect to specific geographical areas. The effects on the individual are also varied. We feel that this is sometimes due to the lack of communication between the victim and their friends and relatives. Other psychological effects were also apparent, including memories of strange dreams, a host of sudden generated fears and phobias such as fear of animals with large eyes and clowns. I was a personal witness to one such case in Brazil where a young female abductee became hysterical when a person dressed in a clown costume jumped out into a street, crowded with people. It took several of us to calm her down. In addition to the psychological trauma produced by isolation there are a myriad of physical effects which go untreated. Many abductees suffer dermatological effects such as the sudden appearance of strange skin markings or changes in pigment or color. Other effects are the craving of salt substances, feelings of dehydration, and sometimes the generalized feelings of flu-like symptoms with muscle aches and pains. Another one of our goals is to solidify abduction research. One of the most disconcerting trends in this regard has to do with the lack of uniform procedures among researchers. I look toward the day when there will be a standardization of investigation procedures and hypnotic regressions. If this is accomplished, the data could be placed in one common database and therefore the same information would be available to all researchers, no matter where they may be located. I believe the only way research should be done is to provide the means for all researchers to draw from a common database. It seems impossible for anyone to reach a valid conclusion unless the information is available to all parties having data which bear on the situation. I believe also that it is imperative that this information be disseminated among medical professionals. I wonder how many abductees pass through the general medical community with no attention being paid to their specific needs. I also have concerns as to the number of possible abductees who have been confined to mental hospitals with false diagnoses. Since I have surgically removed numerous foreign objects from feet during the past thirty years, I am acutely aware of how many objects were removed and probably thrown away having undergone little scrutiny or a vague diagnosis. All doctors performing these surgeries were only concerned about the entities being fully removed or whether the surrounding tissue was benign or malignant. Another of our future efforts will be to hold an abduction conference where every researcher of merit will be able to bring their ideas and suggestions. I envision this as a high-powered event which will attract the best minds in this subject from all over the world. It would be also helpful to include representation from other segments of the scientific community such as psychology, psychiatry, physics and astronomy. What does the future hold for the field of ufology in general? I believe that the complete picture is very complex. Public opinion polls in the United States, shows that the general public believes we are being visited by life forms from elsewhere. I think there is a government coverup in which a controlled dissemination of information about those entities is being made. The book The Day After Roswell written by now retired army Col. Phillip Corso is one of the prime examples. Since his book was released in June 1997, no government official has made an effort to refute his statements which claim that aliens crashed at Roswell and the army recovered them and their craft. He furthermore states that he himself had charge of crash debris and had it researched. Another example of controlled information has to do with the recent deluge of television programming, demonstrated by individual one-hour shows and an onslaught of commercials having to do with alien visitation, not to mention the extraordinary number of major motion pictures dealing with this subject. It seems apparent that the powers that be are attempting to subtly inform the masses that we may have open contact with beings from elsewhere. I do not believe, however, that every source of information coming from the government is inaccurate or incorrect. I believe that many in our government do not have access to this knowledge. This is also true of the very laboratories we are working with on our research. How could we trust their findings if we did not have some trust in the institutions we are dealing with? We found there seems to be a pervasive paranoia amongst certain investigators within the field of ufology, believing they are constantly spied upon and can not trust even the slightest information presented by any laboratory that does government work. I have found it impossible to locate a good laboratory which does not have government contracts. I don't believe that our results have been interfered with or distorted in any way. In another area, hard science itself seems to be providing information to the public which helps to shape public opinion about alien life. This includes the possibility of life on Mars and other planets as well as extraordinary life forms recently discovered on our world such as those micro-organisms which live in some of the hot water vents in the Pacific Ocean. The complexities of modem physics have yielded data recently released to the general public which is also mind-boggling. Subjects such as the possibility of time travel, faster-than-light travel, non-locality of the mind, universal consciousness and particle memory are currently being studied. It appears man's knowledge is undergoing a revolution. Another pioneering area for exploration has to do with the expansion of human consciousness. If beings from elsewhere are engaged in some sort of program to expand human consciousness, they may have created a problem for not only us but also for themselves. If these entities have been continuously manipulating the human race for thousands of years, as the ancient astronaut hypothesis suggests, why do we suddenly recall the abduction process? The awareness of abduction seems to have occurred only within the recent past. Is it possible that our race is becoming more acutely aware of our environment and through this process we have also become aware we are being tampered with?"

        "text_target": "______________________  We feel that it is important, given the information that we have provided thus far, to respond to questions that must surely arise regarding our reality and the significance of the messages that we have come to give. ~  Given the lack of hard evidence, why should people believe what you are telling them about the Intervention? First, there must be great evidence concerning the visitation to your world. We have been told that this is the case. Yet we have also been told by the Unseen Ones that people do not know how to understand the evidence and that they give it their own meaning-a meaning that they prefer to give it, a meaning that provides comfort and reassurance for the most part. We are certain that there is adequate evidence to verify that the Intervention is occurring in the world today if one takes the time to look and to investigate this matter. The fact that your governments or religious leaders do not reveal such things does not mean that such a great event is not occurring in your midst. ~  How can people know that you are real? Regarding our reality, we cannot demonstrate our physical presence to you, and so you must discern the meaning and the import of our words. At this point, it is not merely a matter of belief. It requires a greater recognition, a Knowledge, a resonance. The words we speak we believe are true, but that does not assure that they can be received as such. We cannot control the response to our message. There are people who require more evidence than can possibly be given. For others, such evidence will not be necessary, for they will feel an inner confirmation. In the meantime, perhaps we remain a controversy, and yet we hope and we trust that our words can be considered seriously and that the evidence that does exist, which is substantial, can be gathered and understood by those who are willing to give this their effort and their focus in life. From our perspective, there is no greater problem, challenge and opportunity to receive your attention. Therefore, you are at the beginning of a new understanding. This does require faith and self-reliance. Many will reject our words simply because they do not believe that we could possibly exist. Others perhaps will think that we are part of some manipulation that is being cast upon the world. We cannot control these responses. We can only reveal our message and our presence in your life, however removed that presence may be. It is not our presence here that is of paramount importance, but the message that we have come to reveal and the greater perspective and understanding that we can provide for you. Your education must begin somewhere. All education begins with the desire to know. We hope that through our discourses we can gain at least part of your confidence in order to begin to reveal what we are here to offer. ~  What do you have to say to those who view the Intervention as a positive thing? We understand, first of all, the expectation that all forces from the heavens are related to your spiritual understanding, traditions and fundamental beliefs. The idea that there is prosaic life in the universe is a challenge to these fundamental assumptions. From our perspective and given the experience of our own cultures, we understand these expectations. In the distant past, we maintained them ourselves. And yet we had to relinquish them in facing the realities of Greater Community life and the meaning of visitation. You live in a great physical universe. It is full of life. This life represents countless manifestations and also represents the evolution of intelligence and spiritual awareness at every level. What this means is that what you will encounter in the Greater Community encompasses almost every possibility. However, you are isolated and do not yet travel in space. And even if you had the capability to reach another world, the universe is vast, and no one has gained the ability to go from one end of the galaxy to the other with any kind of speed. Therefore, the physical universe remains enormous and incomprehensible. No one has mastered its laws. No one has conquered its territories. No one can claim complete dominance or control. Life has a great humbling effect in this way. Even far beyond your borders this is true. You should then come to expect that you will meet intelligences representing forces for good, forces for ignorance and those who are more neutral regarding you. However, in the realities of Greater Community travel and exploration, emerging races such as your own will, almost without exception, encounter resource explorers, collectives and those seeking advantage for themselves as their first contact with Greater Community life. Regarding the positive interpretation of visitation, part of this is human expectation and the natural desire to welcome a good outcome and to seek help from the Greater Community for the problems that humanity has not been able to resolve on its own. It is normal to expect such things, particularly when you are considering that your visitors have greater capabilities than do you. However, a large part of the problem in interpreting the great visitation has to do with the will and the agenda of the visitors themselves. For they are encouraging people everywhere to view their presence here as wholly beneficial to humanity and to its needs.",
        "text_source": "There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "The Allies Briefings were given to the author over a span of 19 years. They offer perspective and vision into a complex subject which, despite decades of mounting evidence, continues to baffle researchers. Yet this perspective is not romantic, speculative or idealistic in its approach to this subject. To the contrary, it is bluntly realistic and uncompromising to the point where it may be quite challenging, even to a reader who is well versed in this subject. Therefore, to receive what these Briefings have to offer requires that you suspend, for a moment at least, many of the beliefs, assumptions and questions that you may have about extraterrestrial Contact and even about how these Briefings were received. The contents of these Briefings are like a message in a bottle sent here from beyond the world. Thus, we should not be so concerned about the bottle but about the message itself. To truly understand this challenging message, we must confront and question many of the prevailing assumptions and tendencies regarding the possibility and the reality of Contact. These include:  denial; hopeful expectation; misinterpreting the evidence to affirm our beliefs; wanting and expecting salvation from the visitors; believing that ET technology will save us; feeling hopeless and submissive to what we assume is a superior force; demanding government disclosure but not ET disclosure; condemning human leaders and institutions while maintaining unquestioned acceptance of the visitors; assuming that because they have not attacked or invaded us, they must be here for our good; assuming that advanced technology equals advanced ethics and spirituality; believing that this phenomenon is a mystery when in fact it is a comprehensible event; believing that ETs in some way have claim to humanity and to this planet; and believing that humanity is irredeemable and cannot make it on its own. The Allies Briefings challenge such assumptions and tendencies and explode many of the myths we currently have about who is visiting us and why they are here. The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions.",
        "text_source": "Though science has inadvertently become our ally, too many individual scientists remain mired in past attitudes. Indifference to an objective consideration of the mass of available UFO data is still the norm. It is our profound hope that Sight Unseen will alert open-minded members of the scientific community to the need to join in this crucially important investigation. Our second goal in writing this book is to provide enough specific information about the aliens' behavior on our planet to enable readers to form their own judgments about its intent and its future course. We have presented nearly a score of UFO abduction cases and provided many verbatim transcripts of the abductees' interviews, letters, and hypnotic sessions. As most of our readers are probably aware, the actual range of this firsthand testimony is far more consistent than the bewildering range of opinions theorists have issued about the meaning of it all. On one end of the scale is what we might call the ultraparanoid interpretation: that the aliens are demons, beings who have come here to capture and devour our children, to use human body parts as replacements, and to feast upon what General Buck Turgison in Dr. Strangelove called our vital bodily fluids. There is not, in our opinion, a scintilla of evidence supporting such a dire and melodramatic reading of the data. On the other end of the spectrum is the idea-hope is perhaps a better word-that the aliens are here as quasi-godlike beings to help us with our problems, to heal our damaged planet, and to offer what has been called, with a straight face, unconditional love. No one who reads the accounts we have been presenting can come to such a rosy- and simplistic-conclusion. The truth is, of course, that we do not know the future. We do not know the aliens' ultimate intentions, nor do we really know what their options are. As the reader may have discerned, Hopkins and Rainey have somewhat differing views about alien intent. We do not share the same balance between hope and pessimism. On the one hand, Rainey suggests: What the ETs may be creating are not hybrids at all but transgenic human beings. It is both biologically possible and would best fit the profile of a secretive, invasive force that might be intent on conquering us from within-or equally possible, healing or altering the genes that no longer work for us in our present environment. The change could happen one genetic code word at a time-or an entire chromosome at a time. Either way, if the genes to be modified were carefully and expertly selected over thousands of years, we might never notice what was happening. The Hollywood-style massive destruction and cultural devastation seen in the movie Independence Day would never have to be played out. Biologists tell us that an entire species can do most of its changing internally, with new species traits only gradually manifesting themselves in outward appearance and behavior. If this is indeed occurring, will these alterations be good for the humans-or bad for the humans? This is a difficult issue to take in both emotionally and intellectually: The subtle but inexorable alteration of the human species. But it may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own has already mastered the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the lifeforms on Earth from those of other planets-or even, perhaps, in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, and with only a handful of mainstream scientists willing or able to risk ridicule and loss of funding, people worldwide who are experiencing the UFO abduction phenomenon firsthand have little choice. They can only hope and pray that these alien beings know what they're doing. On the other hand, Hopkins cautions, in such a transaction the odds favor us losing and the aliens gaining. He states: The twenty-seven years I have spent working with abductees, listening to their traumatic encounters, and trying to help them heal a lifetime of psychic damage, have left me hardened to reassuring talk of beings of light practicing benevolent tough love. I have seen too much pain to allow myself more than a life-sustaining modicum of hope. And yet, I may be wrong. Though abductions inevitably leave the abductees scarred, emotionally and psychologically, there is no sign that this kind of psychic damage was intended. In fact, there are many indications that the UFO occupants try to minimize the pain and emotional damage their activities naturally inflict."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",

The fact that contact has been restricted to relatively few people so far, rather than being on a wide scale, may be for a number of sound reasons-not least of which the cultural shock that would be engendered.

Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe. National security policy-makers might argue for classification of the contact and the information received. Some scholars, particularly those personally involved in the first contact, might be equally possessive about the information and the channel, especially if they distrusted governments and held a low opinion of the general population. As Bob Lazar stresses, although advanced alien technology could be put to use for the benefit of all, the same technology could equally well be used for destructive purposes, such as the construction of a superbomb. Michael Michaud foresees another problem relating to the acquisition of alien technology: that it could undermine our spirit of invention and independent initiative, forcing massive readjustment and unemployment, and threatening existing economic institutions. I take the view that those few within governments who are aware of the situation are acting in our best interests by gradually presenting the information in such a way that it will lessen the political, economic, religious, and psychological shock.

        "text_target": "The Allies Briefings were given to the author over a span of 19 years. They offer perspective and vision into a complex subject which, despite decades of mounting evidence, continues to baffle researchers. Yet this perspective is not romantic, speculative or idealistic in its approach to this subject. To the contrary, it is bluntly realistic and uncompromising to the point where it may be quite challenging, even to a reader who is well versed in this subject. Therefore, to receive what these Briefings have to offer requires that you suspend, for a moment at least, many of the beliefs, assumptions and questions that you may have about extraterrestrial Contact and even about how these Briefings were received. The contents of these Briefings are like a message in a bottle sent here from beyond the world. Thus, we should not be so concerned about the bottle but about the message itself. To truly understand this challenging message, we must confront and question many of the prevailing assumptions and tendencies regarding the possibility and the reality of Contact. These include:  denial; hopeful expectation; misinterpreting the evidence to affirm our beliefs; wanting and expecting salvation from the visitors; believing that ET technology will save us; feeling hopeless and submissive to what we assume is a superior force; demanding government disclosure but not ET disclosure; condemning human leaders and institutions while maintaining unquestioned acceptance of the visitors; assuming that because they have not attacked or invaded us, they must be here for our good; assuming that advanced technology equals advanced ethics and spirituality; believing that this phenomenon is a mystery when in fact it is a comprehensible event; believing that ETs in some way have claim to humanity and to this planet; and believing that humanity is irredeemable and cannot make it on its own. The Allies Briefings challenge such assumptions and tendencies and explode many of the myths we currently have about who is visiting us and why they are here. The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions.",
        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves. No one in the world is prepared to give you this counsel, for how could anyone know? It takes your allies, the Allies of Humanity, to provide this perspective and this orientation. Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings.",

        "text_source": "Christianity is a bit different, and there are obvious, identifiable rifts within it. The Roman Catholic church, on the one hand, has for the past few decades gone out of its way to promote the idea of extraterrestrial life. Quite a few statements have issued from the Vatican supporting the notion of an abundance of life in the universe as part of God's great plan. On the other hand, many evangelical Christians will interpret any alleged extraterrestrial presence as demonic. Several passages from the New Testament have been used to support this position. New Age beliefs are different still. Most self-described New Agers are inclined to look at these other beings in a positive light, as humanity's benefactors and even space brothers. Since the 1970s, such beliefs have spread throughout the world, and certainly into the UFO subculture. There is no bridge long enough to join this viewpoint with that of the evangelicals. The rift is irreconcilable and only two things can resolve it. One is an overwhelming amount of new information that will satisfy people to form an opinion. The other is time: time for new generations to arise, with new perspectives that cannot now even be predicted. People can change, but deep changes that affect entire societies can come only from new generations. Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear. Current research into abductions and other forms of contact hint not only that space and time have somehow been mastered by these other beings, but that the mind is a critical element in their relationship to us. In this case, by consciousness we mean something that is nonlocal, something like psi phenomena. A series of well-funded scientific studies of the telepathic elements of contact, for instance, could be valuable additions to our knowledge of the mind and of the fabric of our reality. It would also allow science possibly to catch up with what many psychics and intuitives already believe, and even provide a useful framework to help us understand why psi phenomena occurs. Belief in psi is not just a woo woo belief, but supported by research into remote viewing, and goes back through all human religions via the power of prayer and meditation. Ultimately, we want to know if consciousness is more than just our brain chemistry, and whether or not we have a spirit or soul. Some might argue that a study of UFO data does not necessarily warrant that belief. I think, however, there is a case to be made that it does. If so, then human consciousness studies will become more widespread, and many new discoveries will await us. Such sciences, anything from remote viewing to out of body travel and space-time manipulation, are probably being explored now within the black budget world and breakaway civilization. Computing and Technology   We have had a global internet for just over twenty years, during which time it has completely changed our world. Whether or not there is a disclosure about UFOs, it will continue to do so."

The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from. In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it. This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family. There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted. And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth. Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated? Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God's punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God's will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done. Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people's sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged-not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power. How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn the Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it's coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust? The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference. People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, Jesus has come to me. And the Jesus says, You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others! And the zealous follower says, Yes, Master, yes, Master! Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention. Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people's religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know. It is humanity's ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity's Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new. This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people. This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction. As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies' message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people's inability to respond. It's like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don't know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, Well, it's just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them. This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all. Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing. Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it's not happening. There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth. Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone! Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, This is what it is! without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today. We encourage the development of people's discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about. We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world. Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it's facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.",
        "text_source": "If the aliens are genuinely concerned with the fate of our planet, then it must be because they have some stake in it. Telling selected abductees that the environment is threatened is useless. The majority of them will not even remember the conversation, and most abductees are neither environmental nor political activists. Moreover, concern for the environment appears to be relatively new on the aliens' agenda. Researchers can date the abduction phenomenon directly to the late 1920s, and family stories suggest its origin in the 1890s. Were the aliens concerned about the environment when they began their Breeding Program at the turn of the century? If so, we have found no evidence suggesting this. It is most likely that the stratagem of environmental concern developed well after the Breeding Program was in place. Seen in this context, researchers must treat statements about the aliens' environmental concerns with utmost skepticism. It is entirely possible that they are using these pronouncements to justify the Breeding Program. They may also be using them to lend morality to their activities. If they can instill in abductees the idea that the human race will destroy itself and they are here to prevent that, then it becomes easier for them to defend their actions and to solicit help from the abductees. Almost as important, the environmental message paints the aliens as benevolent, which fits in nicely with what many humans so desperately want them to be. Is it not possible that the aliens are concerned about the environment because they want a clean Earth for themselves? The fact that humans live on a sullied planet does not seem important to them, but that they might have to live on a despoiled planet may be intolerable. Preventing Destruction  Images of mass destruction are extremely common during abductions-much more so than environmental images. Virtually every abductee has had to watch scenes of destruction. Tidal waves, floods, earthquakes, atomic bombs, and wars and their aftennaths abound. Devastated cities lie in rubble. Dead people are everywhere. Injured and dying men, women, and children cry out for help to the surviving abductee. Abductees are led to believe that this is going to happen, that it need not happen, and that humans have caused it. The aliens sometimes suggest a way to avoid destruction-themselves. They are working to avert this unhappy scenario. Their Breeding Program is the hope of the future and will lead to peace and contentment. They can bring about a happy ending to the horror. Patti Layne had this experience:  And they said, that they needed some parts, some things from me and that it would help everyone on the planet. They said that there are going to be some bad things that are going to happen. They gave me some pretty vivid images.... And I sat on the chair and they put this scope on my head.... They said that there are going to be some bad things that are going to happen. They told me terrible things would happen to the earth and that it would just blow up, and cities would crumble and mountains would fall and the sun would be black. And they said that it's bad because people can't stop being greedy and that they were doing something to help us, and I don't know how. I couldn't make the connection how putting something into my stomach would help us."

        "text_source": "There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "The Allies Briefings were given to the author over a span of 19 years. They offer perspective and vision into a complex subject which, despite decades of mounting evidence, continues to baffle researchers. Yet this perspective is not romantic, speculative or idealistic in its approach to this subject. To the contrary, it is bluntly realistic and uncompromising to the point where it may be quite challenging, even to a reader who is well versed in this subject. Therefore, to receive what these Briefings have to offer requires that you suspend, for a moment at least, many of the beliefs, assumptions and questions that you may have about extraterrestrial Contact and even about how these Briefings were received. The contents of these Briefings are like a message in a bottle sent here from beyond the world. Thus, we should not be so concerned about the bottle but about the message itself. To truly understand this challenging message, we must confront and question many of the prevailing assumptions and tendencies regarding the possibility and the reality of Contact. These include:  denial; hopeful expectation; misinterpreting the evidence to affirm our beliefs; wanting and expecting salvation from the visitors; believing that ET technology will save us; feeling hopeless and submissive to what we assume is a superior force; demanding government disclosure but not ET disclosure; condemning human leaders and institutions while maintaining unquestioned acceptance of the visitors; assuming that because they have not attacked or invaded us, they must be here for our good; assuming that advanced technology equals advanced ethics and spirituality; believing that this phenomenon is a mystery when in fact it is a comprehensible event; believing that ETs in some way have claim to humanity and to this planet; and believing that humanity is irredeemable and cannot make it on its own. The Allies Briefings challenge such assumptions and tendencies and explode many of the myths we currently have about who is visiting us and why they are here. The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions.",
        "text_source": "Christianity is a bit different, and there are obvious, identifiable rifts within it. The Roman Catholic church, on the one hand, has for the past few decades gone out of its way to promote the idea of extraterrestrial life. Quite a few statements have issued from the Vatican supporting the notion of an abundance of life in the universe as part of God's great plan. On the other hand, many evangelical Christians will interpret any alleged extraterrestrial presence as demonic. Several passages from the New Testament have been used to support this position. New Age beliefs are different still. Most self-described New Agers are inclined to look at these other beings in a positive light, as humanity's benefactors and even space brothers. Since the 1970s, such beliefs have spread throughout the world, and certainly into the UFO subculture. There is no bridge long enough to join this viewpoint with that of the evangelicals. The rift is irreconcilable and only two things can resolve it. One is an overwhelming amount of new information that will satisfy people to form an opinion. The other is time: time for new generations to arise, with new perspectives that cannot now even be predicted. People can change, but deep changes that affect entire societies can come only from new generations. Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear. Current research into abductions and other forms of contact hint not only that space and time have somehow been mastered by these other beings, but that the mind is a critical element in their relationship to us. In this case, by consciousness we mean something that is nonlocal, something like psi phenomena. A series of well-funded scientific studies of the telepathic elements of contact, for instance, could be valuable additions to our knowledge of the mind and of the fabric of our reality. It would also allow science possibly to catch up with what many psychics and intuitives already believe, and even provide a useful framework to help us understand why psi phenomena occurs. Belief in psi is not just a woo woo belief, but supported by research into remote viewing, and goes back through all human religions via the power of prayer and meditation. Ultimately, we want to know if consciousness is more than just our brain chemistry, and whether or not we have a spirit or soul. Some might argue that a study of UFO data does not necessarily warrant that belief. I think, however, there is a case to be made that it does. If so, then human consciousness studies will become more widespread, and many new discoveries will await us. Such sciences, anything from remote viewing to out of body travel and space-time manipulation, are probably being explored now within the black budget world and breakaway civilization. Computing and Technology   We have had a global internet for just over twenty years, during which time it has completely changed our world. Whether or not there is a disclosure about UFOs, it will continue to do so."

It is not simply that they want you to be a work force for them; they want you to become a part of them. This adds to their collective strength and will minimize any resistance in the future that humanity might mount for its own sake. This is why there is such a great investment of time and energy in gaining human allegiance, in bonding with humanity through interbreeding and in establishing a deep and pervasive association with the human family. This world is so valuable that the Intervention does not want to risk a human revolution in the future. Such revolutions have happened before. We can attest to this from our own experience. We are the product of such revolutions in our own worlds. Though our circumstances were quite different from yours, the nature of the Intervention and the methods employed were actually quite similar. This is why we can speak with authority on this subject. The inducements that will be brought to bear will be varied, depending on who is being reached and for what purpose. For individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative in the halls of government, the inducement will be the promise of greater power and technology. Humanity is in a very vulnerable position in this sense because its belief in technology and its hope that technology will solve all of its problems are very, very strong. This of course has been supported by the Intervention because this is one of the primary avenues in which humanity will likely become dependent on the Intervention itself. To those in the corridors of power in your governments, those individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative, the promise of greater technology and even world dominion will be presented. This can be presented either through the Mental Environment as ideas sent into the minds of these individuals, or, as has already occurred, there may be face-to-face encounters with the visitors themselves. And what will they offer humanity? They will offer humanity some of their basic technology, certainly nothing that they consider to be advanced, unique, secret or sacred to them-basic propulsion in space, basic use of electronic energy, methodologies of production. They will not teach power in the Mental Environment, for they do not want humanity to have this power unless it is completely controlled and directed by the visitors themselves.",
        "text_source": "CULTURE SHOCK  Our own galaxy-one of an infinite number-is comprised of several hundred billion stars, and statistically, it is probable that life has evolved on some planetary systems to the extent that space travel and colonization are commonplace. In assuming that the lifetime of advanced civilizations is ten million years, science writer Ian Ridpath has speculated that there could be as many as one million advanced civilizations like ourselves or more advanced in our galaxy, and surmises that the main interest of an old and advanced civilization may be in the developing creatures of the Galaxy, as the anthropologists of the Western world are increasingly fascinated by the stone- age societies that remain on Earth.23 Dr. Bernard Oliver, of NASA's SETI project, has remarked on the possibility that an interconnecting galactic community of advanced cultures already exists. Although some astronomers and exobiologists concur that we may have been visited in the distant past, and are certain to be visited in the future, present-day visits are out of the question. The logic of such reasoning escapes me. The fact that contact has been restricted to relatively few people so far, rather than being on a wide scale, may be for a number of sound reasons-not least of which the cultural shock that would be engendered. For us this could hold more danger than the combination of nuclear arms, energy shortages, overpopulation, dwindling resources and pollution, believes Edward Ashpole, author of The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Some visitors may not want us to know what they are doing here, and in any event, can probably go about their business with none of us any the wiser (particularly if they are able to function in another dimension!). It is therefore likely that those who have been contacted are fed a certain amount of false information. Disinformation could well be an inevitable consequence of contact. Others may be so advanced, technologically, culturally, and spiritually , that contact with our relatively retarded species might be seen as disadvantageous to both parties. In this regard, the comments made by Daniel Fry's alleged extraterrestrial friend in 1949 are worth recounting. We will never attempt to thrust either our knowledge or our culture upon your people, he said, and we will never offer it unless there is substantial evidence that they desire it, and that it would be advantageous to them. There is certainly no such evidence at the present time. It is also true that the purpose of this visit is not entirely philanthropic, since there are some materials upon your planet which we could use to the advantage of both our peoples; materials which you have in abundance but which are rather scarce elsewhere in this solar system. While the use of some of these materials would be of assistance to us, our services to your people will not be made contingent upon such use. Any knowledge or aid which we can give will be freely offered. . . . If we took steps to force the acceptance of our reality upon their consciousness, Fry was told, about 30 percent of the people would consider us as gods, and could attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their welfare. This is a responsibility we could not be permitted to assume, even if we were able to discharge it, which of course, we are not. Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe. National security policy-makers might argue for classification of the contact and the information received. Some scholars, particularly those personally involved in the first contact, might be equally possessive about the information and the channel, especially if they distrusted governments and held a low opinion of the general population. As Bob Lazar stresses, although advanced alien technology could be put to use for the benefit of all, the same technology could equally well be used for destructive purposes, such as the construction of a superbomb. Michael Michaud foresees another problem relating to the acquisition of alien technology: that it could undermine our spirit of invention and independent initiative, forcing massive readjustment and unemployment, and threatening existing economic institutions. I take the view that those few within governments who are aware of the situation are acting in our best interests by gradually presenting the information in such a way that it will lessen the political, economic, religious, and psychological shock. But eventually, the ultimate secret will be revealed. The truth about UFOs may be painful for us to face, and this might provide a continuing rationale for the government to maintain secrecy, says the astrophysicist Dr. Brian O'Leary. But the truth will and must be known eventually. Continuing our denials and fears, in my opinion, [is] only adding to the problem. We are all in this together. The evidence available to me suggests that we are being visited by a number of extraterrestrial groups.31 Some could be here for less than benign purposes, others perhaps visiting as anthropologists or even tourists. But it seems logical that some groups, motivated by a vested interest in the survival of our planet and its species, have established contact with a relatively small number of our people, partly perhaps to lend us a helping hand as we reach, falteringly, toward the stars. Let us hope that the advantages of contact will ultimately outweigh the disadvantages, leading to a more complete and profound understanding of our place in the universal scheme."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "Our research project began in August, 1995. Since that time we have traveled a road filled with twists, turns, embankments, cliffs and ambushes. There were times when we were encouraged and uplifted and at other times discouraged. However, I did not give in to these feelings. This in part was due to my burning desire for knowledge and the encouragement of friends who urged me on. One of these was Whitley Strieber, who constantly pointed out the importance of the work we were engaged in. Another person who inspired me was my cousin Ken Ring. The primary goal I pursued was to marry hard science to a subject regarded by many as a fringe area, to say the least and more often was regarded as pseudoscience. In looking back on our endeavors, I can say without reservation that in my opinion, this goal was accomplished. However, because of unhelpful comments from the public at large and the armchair scientific community, it became necessary to restrict our communication on the internet. Many times, outside of public view, I found information exchanges occurring among scientists who were debating portions of the data we brought forward. One such debate took place after our July 1997 press conference in Roswell. Several of the scientists who saw the raw data supplied by Dr. VernonClark had questions about the actual mathematics involved in the Silicon isotopic ratios. As it turned out one of the people who made these calculations had erred. The net result was a new calculation which provided even a greater deviant from the terrestrial isotopes than previously recorded. Closing these debates to the general public made this exchange between true scientists possible. The increasing interest generated by the scientific community is what we feel is needed to have our research published in a major scientific journal. We look forward to this occurring in the very near future. Since our approach to ufology ultimately involves the scientific study of physical evidence, our ultimate goal seems possible to many of our colleagues: actually capturing one or more of the elusive beings which are entering our environment. I feel that any creature which operates in our three-dimensional world has habits. If this is correct, these habits can be recorded, correlated, studied and ultimately used to capture these beings. Progress in our investigations is directly related to our ability to pay for the necessary work. Our efforts to raise funding have been diverse. Among numerous avenues, we believe the entertainment industry may provide the much-needed capital to continue our endeavors. We are looking forward to a one-hour television production based on our work which we hope will be shown world-wide. If this comes about, the funds generated will go directly into our research and allow it to continue without interruption. It has been made very clear to us that there is a large amount of physical evidence being kept secret. Many of the individuals with this evidence have deep fears of reprisal from government agencies. Because we have taken the scientific approach to this subject, we have been able to dampen some of their fears. In addition, our policy has always been to accommodate the requests of anyone who wishes to turn physical evidence over to us. If they request anonymity, we are always happy to comply. One of the prime examples concerned the piece of material believed to be from the Roswell crash site. In dealing with the supplier of this material, we demonstrated that we would live up to the agreement we had made with him. We did not release one iota of information about him. Because we demonstrated our sincerity, he trusted us with additional information. Another of our goals is to extend our research to an international level. We look forward to the time when we can arrange for the performance of surgical procedures in such countries as Brazil, England, Mexico, Japan, Ecuador, Australia and Puerto Rico. I would like to give assistance without charge to the people of these countries. We want to help with their physiological and emotional needs. During our travels we began to realize that the abduction phenomenon is a world-wide issue. Its effects seem to vary with respect to specific geographical areas. The effects on the individual are also varied. We feel that this is sometimes due to the lack of communication between the victim and their friends and relatives. Other psychological effects were also apparent, including memories of strange dreams, a host of sudden generated fears and phobias such as fear of animals with large eyes and clowns. I was a personal witness to one such case in Brazil where a young female abductee became hysterical when a person dressed in a clown costume jumped out into a street, crowded with people. It took several of us to calm her down. In addition to the psychological trauma produced by isolation there are a myriad of physical effects which go untreated. Many abductees suffer dermatological effects such as the sudden appearance of strange skin markings or changes in pigment or color. Other effects are the craving of salt substances, feelings of dehydration, and sometimes the generalized feelings of flu-like symptoms with muscle aches and pains. Another one of our goals is to solidify abduction research. One of the most disconcerting trends in this regard has to do with the lack of uniform procedures among researchers. I look toward the day when there will be a standardization of investigation procedures and hypnotic regressions. If this is accomplished, the data could be placed in one common database and therefore the same information would be available to all researchers, no matter where they may be located. I believe the only way research should be done is to provide the means for all researchers to draw from a common database. It seems impossible for anyone to reach a valid conclusion unless the information is available to all parties having data which bear on the situation. I believe also that it is imperative that this information be disseminated among medical professionals. I wonder how many abductees pass through the general medical community with no attention being paid to their specific needs. I also have concerns as to the number of possible abductees who have been confined to mental hospitals with false diagnoses. Since I have surgically removed numerous foreign objects from feet during the past thirty years, I am acutely aware of how many objects were removed and probably thrown away having undergone little scrutiny or a vague diagnosis. All doctors performing these surgeries were only concerned about the entities being fully removed or whether the surrounding tissue was benign or malignant. Another of our future efforts will be to hold an abduction conference where every researcher of merit will be able to bring their ideas and suggestions. I envision this as a high-powered event which will attract the best minds in this subject from all over the world. It would be also helpful to include representation from other segments of the scientific community such as psychology, psychiatry, physics and astronomy. What does the future hold for the field of ufology in general? I believe that the complete picture is very complex. Public opinion polls in the United States, shows that the general public believes we are being visited by life forms from elsewhere. I think there is a government coverup in which a controlled dissemination of information about those entities is being made. The book The Day After Roswell written by now retired army Col. Phillip Corso is one of the prime examples. Since his book was released in June 1997, no government official has made an effort to refute his statements which claim that aliens crashed at Roswell and the army recovered them and their craft. He furthermore states that he himself had charge of crash debris and had it researched. Another example of controlled information has to do with the recent deluge of television programming, demonstrated by individual one-hour shows and an onslaught of commercials having to do with alien visitation, not to mention the extraordinary number of major motion pictures dealing with this subject. It seems apparent that the powers that be are attempting to subtly inform the masses that we may have open contact with beings from elsewhere. I do not believe, however, that every source of information coming from the government is inaccurate or incorrect. I believe that many in our government do not have access to this knowledge. This is also true of the very laboratories we are working with on our research. How could we trust their findings if we did not have some trust in the institutions we are dealing with? We found there seems to be a pervasive paranoia amongst certain investigators within the field of ufology, believing they are constantly spied upon and can not trust even the slightest information presented by any laboratory that does government work. I have found it impossible to locate a good laboratory which does not have government contracts. I don't believe that our results have been interfered with or distorted in any way. In another area, hard science itself seems to be providing information to the public which helps to shape public opinion about alien life. This includes the possibility of life on Mars and other planets as well as extraordinary life forms recently discovered on our world such as those micro-organisms which live in some of the hot water vents in the Pacific Ocean. The complexities of modem physics have yielded data recently released to the general public which is also mind-boggling. Subjects such as the possibility of time travel, faster-than-light travel, non-locality of the mind, universal consciousness and particle memory are currently being studied. It appears man's knowledge is undergoing a revolution. Another pioneering area for exploration has to do with the expansion of human consciousness. If beings from elsewhere are engaged in some sort of program to expand human consciousness, they may have created a problem for not only us but also for themselves. If these entities have been continuously manipulating the human race for thousands of years, as the ancient astronaut hypothesis suggests, why do we suddenly recall the abduction process? The awareness of abduction seems to have occurred only within the recent past. Is it possible that our race is becoming more acutely aware of our environment and through this process we have also become aware we are being tampered with?"

        "text_target": "How perfect this is for the alien agenda. It takes time, but from their perspective, well, the results are worth it. The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from. In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it. This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family. There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted. And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth. Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated? Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God's punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God's will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done. Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people's sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged-not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power. How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn the Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it's coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust? The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference. People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, Jesus has come to me. And the Jesus says, You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others! And the zealous follower says, Yes, Master, yes, Master! Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention. Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people's religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know. It is humanity's ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity's Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new. This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people. This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction. As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies' message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people's inability to respond. It's like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don't know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, Well, it's just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them. This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all. Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing. Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it's not happening. There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth. Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone! Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, This is what it is! without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today. We encourage the development of people's discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about. We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world. Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it's facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.",
        "text_source": "In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

        "text_target": "The first area of activity of the visitors is to influence individuals in positions of power and authority. Because the visitors do not want to destroy anything in the world or harm the world's resources, they seek to gain influence over those whom they perceive to be in positions of power, within government and religion primarily. They seek contact, but only with certain individuals. They have the power to make this contact, and they have the power of persuasion. Not all whom they contact will be persuaded, but many will be. The promise of greater power, greater technology and world domination will intrigue and incite many individuals. And it is these individuals with whom the visitors will seek to establish a liaison. There are very few people in the governments of the world who are being so affected, but their numbers are growing. The visitors understand the hierarchy of power because they themselves live by it, following their own chain of command, you might say. They are highly organized and very focused in their endeavors, and the idea of having cultures full of free-thinking individuals is largely foreign to them. They do not comprehend or understand individual freedom. They are like many technologically advanced societies in the Greater Community who function both within their respective worlds and in their establishments across vast reaches of space, utilizing a very well-established and rigid form of government and organization. They believe that humanity is chaotic and unruly, and they feel they are bringing order to a situation that they cannot themselves comprehend. Individual freedom is unknown to them, and they do not see its value. As a result, what they seek to establish in the world will not honor this freedom. Therefore, their first area of endeavor is to establish a liaison with individuals in positions of power and influence in order to gain their allegiance and to persuade them of the beneficial aspects of relationship and shared purpose. The second avenue of activity, which is perhaps the most difficult to consider from your perspective, is the manipulation of religious values and impulses. The visitors understand that humanity's greatest abilities also represent its greatest vulnerability. People's longing for individual redemption represents one of the greatest assets the human family has to offer, even to the Greater Community. But it is also your weakness. And it is these impulses and these values that will be used. Several groups of the visitors wish to establish themselves as spiritual agents because they know how to speak in the mental environment. They can communicate to people directly, and unfortunately, because there are very few people in the world who can discern the difference between a spiritual voice and the visitors' voice, the situation becomes very difficult. Therefore, the second area of activity is to gain people's allegiance through their religious and spiritual motivations. Actually, this can be done quite easily because humanity is not yet strong or developed in the mental environment. It is difficult for people to discern where these impulses are coming from. Many people want to give themselves to anything they think has a greater voice and a greater power. Your visitors can project images-images of your saints, of your teachers, of angels-images that are held dear and sacred within your world. They have cultivated this ability through many, many centuries of attempting to influence each other and by learning the ways of persuasion that are practiced in many places in the Greater Community. They consider you primitive, and so they feel they can exert this influence and use these methods upon you. Here there is an attempt to contact those individuals who are considered sensitive, receptive and naturally given to be cooperative. Many people will be selected, but a few will be chosen based upon these particular qualities. Your visitors will seek to gain allegiance with these individuals, to gain their trust and to gain their devotion, telling the recipients that the visitors are here to uplift humanity spiritually, to give humanity new hope, new blessings and new power-indeed promising the things that people want so dearly but have not yet found themselves. Perhaps you may wonder, How can such a thing occur? But we can assure you that it is not difficult once you learn these skills and abilities. The effort here is to pacify and to reeducate people through spiritual persuasion. This Pacification Program is used differently with different religious groups depending upon their ideals and their temperament. It is always aimed at receptive individuals. Here it is hoped that people will lose their sense of discernment and will become wholly trusting of the greater power that they feel is being given to them by the visitors. Once this allegiance is established, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to discern what they know within themselves from what is being told to them. It is a very subtle but very pervasive form of persuasion and manipulation. We shall speak more on this as we proceed. Let us now mention the third area of activity, which is to establish the visitors' presence in the world and to have people become used to this presence. They want humanity to become acclimated to this very great change that is occurring in your midst-to have you become acclimated to the visitors' physical presence and to their effect on your own mental environment. To serve this purpose, they will create establishments here, though not in view. These establishments will be hidden, but they will be very powerful in casting an influence on human populations that are near them. The visitors will take great care and time to make sure that these establishments are effective and that enough people are in allegiance to them. It is these people who will guard and preserve the visitors' presence. This is exactly what is occurring in your world at this time. It represents a great challenge and unfortunately a great risk. This very same thing that we are describing has happened so many times in so many places in the Greater Community. And emerging races such as your own are always the most vulnerable. Some emerging races are able to establish their own awareness, ability and cooperation to the extent that they can offset outside influences such as these and establish a presence and a position in the Greater Community. Yet many races, before they even attain this freedom, fall under the control and influence of foreign powers. We understand that this information may incite considerable fear and perhaps denial or confusion. But as we observe events, we realize that there are very few people who are aware of the situation as it actually exists. Even those people who are becoming aware of the presence of alien forces are not in a position and do not have the vantage point from which they can see the situation clearly. And being ever hopeful and optimistic, they seek to give this great phenomenon as much positive meaning as they can. However, the Greater Community is a competitive environment, a difficult environment. Those who engage in space travel do not necessarily represent the spiritually advanced, for those who are spiritually advanced seek insulation from the Greater Community. They do not seek commerce. They do not seek to influence other races or to engage in the very complex array of relationships that are established for mutual trade and benefit. Instead, the spiritually advanced seek to remain hidden. This is a very different understanding, perhaps, but a necessary one for you to come to comprehend the great predicament that humanity is facing. Yet this predicament holds great possibilities. We would like to speak about these now. Despite the gravity of the situation that we are describing, we do not feel that these circumstances are a tragedy for humanity. Indeed, if these circumstances can be recognized and understood, and if the preparation for the Greater Community, which now exists in the world, can be utilized, studied and applied, then people everywhere of good conscience will have the ability to learn Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom. Thus, people everywhere will be able to find the basis for cooperation so that the human family can finally establish a unity that has never been established here before. For it will take the overshadowing of the Greater Community to unite humanity. And this overshadowing is occurring now. It is your evolution to emerge into a Greater Community of intelligent life. It will happen whether you are prepared or not. It must occur. Preparation, then, becomes the key. Understanding and clarity-these are the things that are necessary and needed in your world at this time. People everywhere have great spiritual gifts that can enable them to see and to know clearly. These gifts are needed now. They need to be recognized, employed and shared freely. It is not merely up to a great teacher or a great saint in your world to do this. It must be cultivated by many more people now. For the situation brings with it necessity, and if necessity can be embraced, it brings with it great opportunity. However, the requirements to learn about the Greater Community and to begin to experience Greater Community Spirituality are tremendous. Never before have human beings had to learn such things in such a short period of time. Indeed, such things have rarely been learned ever by anyone in your world before. But now the need has changed. The circumstances are different. Now there are new influences in your midst, influences that you can feel and that you can know. The visitors seek to disable people from having this vision and this Knowledge within themselves, for your visitors do not have it within themselves. They do not see its value. They do not understand its reality. In this, humanity as a whole is more advanced than they are. But this is only a potential, a potential which must now be cultivated. The alien presence in the world is growing. It is growing every day, every year. Many more people are falling under its persuasion, losing their ability to know, becoming confused and distracted, believing in things that can only weaken them and make them impotent in the face of those who would seek to use them for their own purposes. Humanity is an emerging race. It is vulnerable. It is facing a set of circumstances and influences now which it has never had to face before. You have only evolved to compete with each other. You have never had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. Yet it is this competition that will strengthen you and will call forth your greatest attributes if the situation can be clearly seen and understood. It is the role of the Unseen Ones to foster this strength. The Unseen Ones, whom you would rightly call angels, do not only speak to the human heart but to hearts everywhere who are able to listen and who have gained the freedom to listen. We come, then, with a difficult message, but a message of promise and hope. Perhaps it is not the message that people want to hear. It is certainly not the message that the visitors would promote. It is a message that can be shared from person to person, and it will be shared because it is natural to do so. Yet the visitors and those who have come under their persuasion will oppose such an awareness. They do not want to see an independent humanity. That is not their purpose. They do not even believe it is beneficial. Therefore, it is our sincere desire that these ideas be considered without trepidation, but with a serious mind and a deep concern that are well justified here. There are many people in the world today, we understand, who feel that a great change is coming for humanity. The Unseen Ones have told us these things. Many causes are attributed to this sense of change. And many outcomes are predicted. Yet unless you can begin to comprehend the reality that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life, you do not yet have the right context for understanding the destiny of humanity or the great change that is occurring in the world. From our perspective, people are born into their time to serve that time. This is a teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, a teaching of which we are students as well. It teaches freedom and the power of shared purpose. It grants authority to the individual and to the individual who can join with others-ideas which are rarely accepted or adopted in the Greater Community, for the Greater Community is not the heavenly state. It is a physical reality with the rigors of survival and all that that entails. All beings within this reality must contend with these needs and issues. And in this, your visitors are more like you than you realize. They are not incomprehensible. They would seek to be incomprehensible, but they can be understood. You have the power to do this, but you must see with clear eyes. You must see with a greater vision and know with a greater intelligence, which you have the possibility to cultivate within yourselves. It is necessary for us now to speak more regarding the second area of influence and persuasion because this has great importance, and it is our sincere desire that you will understand these things and consider them for yourself. The religions of the world hold the key to human dedication and human allegiance, more than governments, more than any other institution. This speaks well for humanity because religions such as these are often hard to find in the Greater Community. Your world is rich in this respect, but your strength is also where you are weak and vulnerable. Many people want to be divinely guided and appointed, to give over the reins of their own lives and to have a greater spiritual power direct them, counsel them and preserve them. This is a genuine desire, but within a Greater Community context, considerable wisdom must be cultivated in order for this desire to be fulfilled. It is very sad for us to see how people will give their authority away so easily-something they have never even fully had, they will give away willingly to those who are unknown to them. This message is destined to reach people who have a greater spiritual affinity. Therefore, it is necessary that we elaborate on this subject. We advocate a spirituality that is taught in the Greater Community, not the spirituality that is governed by nations, governments or political alliances, but a natural spirituality-the ability to know, to see and to act. And yet this is not emphasized by your visitors. They seek to have people believe that the visitors are their family, that the visitors are their home, that the visitors are their brothers and sisters, their mothers and fathers. Many people want to believe, and so they believe. People want to give over their personal authority, and so it is given over. People want to see friends and salvation in the visitors, and so this is what they are shown. It will take great sobriety and objectivity in order to see through these deceptions and these difficulties. It will be necessary for people to do this if humanity is to successfully emerge into the Greater Community and maintain its freedom and its self-determination in an environment of greater influences and greater forces. In this, your world could be overtaken without firing a shot, for violence is considered primitive and crude and is rarely employed in matters such as this. Perhaps you may ask, Does this mean that there is an invasion of our world? We must say that the answer to this is yes, an invasion of the most subtle kind. If you can entertain these thoughts and consider them seriously, you will be able to see these things for yourself. The evidence of this invasion is everywhere. You can see how human ability is offset by the desire for happiness, peace and security, how people's vision and ability to know are hampered by influences even within their own cultures. How much greater these influences will be within a Greater Community environment. This is the difficult message that we must present. This is the message that must be said, the truth that must be spoken, the truth that is vital and cannot wait. It is so necessary for people now to learn a greater Knowledge, a greater Wisdom and a greater Spirituality so that they may find their true abilities and be able to use them effectively.",
        "text_source": "Phones will continue to evolve and acquire new capabilities, perhaps detecting infrared signals or electromagnetic disturbances. The possibilities seem endless. It is essential for researchers to remain aware of these developments and use them. Of course, we need the technology in order to communicate and learn from each other. The value of YouTube has already been discussed, but beyond this, we face a future of ubiquitous video conferencing and live streaming. Already, these technologies are both starting to make a difference in ufology. They need to be pushed further. Ultimately, however, no matter how far into the future ufology goes, it must continue to rely upon sound investigations and proper reporting of results that actually reach the public. Scientific ufology, but with modern leadership, political savvy, and a commitment to the people. Ufology: Getting Personal   One thing I have learned in my two decades of studying the UFO phenomenon is that it has the power to captivate someone's attention and become an obsession. I will never forget my first year of true attention and research into this field, and the many nights of lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to reconfigure my worldview in a way that made sense with the new facts I had learned. For myself, the feeling was more akin to an intense intellectual curiosity than anything else, a splinter in the mind (in the words of the character Morpheus from the movie, The Matrix). For some, however, the effect goes deeper still. I have seen personalities become nearly destabilized by the effect of having their once-stable worldview shaken or even shattered by the subject of UFOs. I don't know of a sure-fire method to prevent this from happening to certain people. We are all different. There are some people, who knows why, who seem to roll with this transformation more easily than others. In some cases, however, there are those who become convinced that they have had experiences of some sort with this phenomenon, including direct contact with these other intelligences. Such people may be correct or not, but there is no question that their new information affects them deeply. They become obsessed by this subject in a way that consumes their lives, sometimes in an unhealthy way. It is a difficult thing for any person to reinvent their basic understanding of the world, especially after they reach a mature age. No one wants to go through that process, because it is an implicit recognition that their many prior years were spent living in a kind of illusory world. Ironically, it is often those with a higher level of formal education who seem to have a hard time with this. After all, they have spent those years convinced that they were ahead of the game, that they were more knowledgeable than the average person about how the world works, and invested much of their self-esteem and identity into that understanding. But it can happen to anyone. All of this is made harder by the fact by their belief that most of their friends, family, and colleagues would either not believe them, or might even ridicule them. And so while they go through this difficult transformation, there are often very few people they can talk to about it. Added to this is another problem. Once someone decides that this is a subject worth their attention, they usually realize that there is an overabundance of information and literature. It can feel overwhelming, especially if one is starting not only with a limited knowledge of the subject, but often a relatively limited knowledge of science, history, philosophy, politics, psychology, or any number of other subjects that are certainly helpful in navigating one's way through this tangled field. But the challenge is harder still when we remember that most people have other responsibilities in their lives: family, jobs, social obligations and the rest. If they work long hours, as many do, they are tired when they come home and are probably not in the mood to do hours of research, day after day, to help recreate some semblance of an ordered reality, especially when that new reality is much less congenial and reassuring than what they had once known. Moreover, they probably don't want to fight the machine, they don't want to be heroes; they just want a good life."

It is so necessary for people now to learn a greater Knowledge, a greater Wisdom and a greater Spirituality so that they may find their true abilities and be able to use them effectively.",
        "text_source": "One can understand then that over the centuries and millennia, cattle have become hypnotized to a certain extent. They understand that as things go, they are well off. They tolerate the strange, two-legged beings who make so many different sounds and who possess such bewildering technological equipment - for such beings are the ones who provide them with so many comforts and such ample meals. Right up to the end, they have no reason to suspect the treachery that suddenly awaits them as they huddle in the cramped pens of the slaughterhouse. Extrapolating toward the macro-cosmic, it is quite possible, perhaps inevitable, that the entire human life cycle is subordinated to the needs of an unperceived macrospecies. ...We may fill some emotional or psychological need, maybe as pets or someone's ant farm. We may be a planet-sized laboratory colony in which our behavior and reactions to various stimuli are being studied. We could be a proving ground for biological or medical experiments in much the way we breed and maintain mice so that we can test the effects of chemicals or drugs before endangering ourselves by using them. In any case, we are kept 'human'. Whether its intentions are 'good' or 'evil' (as imperfectly as we understand those terms) is irrelevant for now, just as it is irrelevant to question human motives for controlling various other life forms. We need them under present circumstances. It is likely the same for the species/universe which exercises control over humanity. John Keel often wrote* about a controlling intelligence in human affairs, as he did in this excerpt from a 1982 magazine article, The Endless Procession: **  Our studies of the UFO percipients and contactees are teaching us that these encounters are more hallucinatory than real, that some complex hypnotic process is involved, and that the real phenomenon is hiding behind a carefully engineered smoke screen of propaganda. Those funny lights and their hypnotic waves of energy are part of something that is related to this planet, and to us. But that something may be far beyond our meager powers of comprehension. There are forces that can distort our reality and warp our fields of space and time. When we are caught in these forces, we struggle to find an acceptable explanation for them, and then the manifestations begin to conform to that explanation and so reinforce it... The ancient gods, and their successors, the god-kings, lied to us and manipulated us and there's no indication that the tactics of the modern Ufonauts are any different."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "Though science has inadvertently become our ally, too many individual scientists remain mired in past attitudes. Indifference to an objective consideration of the mass of available UFO data is still the norm. It is our profound hope that Sight Unseen will alert open-minded members of the scientific community to the need to join in this crucially important investigation. Our second goal in writing this book is to provide enough specific information about the aliens' behavior on our planet to enable readers to form their own judgments about its intent and its future course. We have presented nearly a score of UFO abduction cases and provided many verbatim transcripts of the abductees' interviews, letters, and hypnotic sessions. As most of our readers are probably aware, the actual range of this firsthand testimony is far more consistent than the bewildering range of opinions theorists have issued about the meaning of it all. On one end of the scale is what we might call the ultraparanoid interpretation: that the aliens are demons, beings who have come here to capture and devour our children, to use human body parts as replacements, and to feast upon what General Buck Turgison in Dr. Strangelove called our vital bodily fluids. There is not, in our opinion, a scintilla of evidence supporting such a dire and melodramatic reading of the data. On the other end of the spectrum is the idea-hope is perhaps a better word-that the aliens are here as quasi-godlike beings to help us with our problems, to heal our damaged planet, and to offer what has been called, with a straight face, unconditional love. No one who reads the accounts we have been presenting can come to such a rosy- and simplistic-conclusion. The truth is, of course, that we do not know the future. We do not know the aliens' ultimate intentions, nor do we really know what their options are. As the reader may have discerned, Hopkins and Rainey have somewhat differing views about alien intent. We do not share the same balance between hope and pessimism. On the one hand, Rainey suggests: What the ETs may be creating are not hybrids at all but transgenic human beings. It is both biologically possible and would best fit the profile of a secretive, invasive force that might be intent on conquering us from within-or equally possible, healing or altering the genes that no longer work for us in our present environment. The change could happen one genetic code word at a time-or an entire chromosome at a time. Either way, if the genes to be modified were carefully and expertly selected over thousands of years, we might never notice what was happening. The Hollywood-style massive destruction and cultural devastation seen in the movie Independence Day would never have to be played out. Biologists tell us that an entire species can do most of its changing internally, with new species traits only gradually manifesting themselves in outward appearance and behavior. If this is indeed occurring, will these alterations be good for the humans-or bad for the humans? This is a difficult issue to take in both emotionally and intellectually: The subtle but inexorable alteration of the human species. But it may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own has already mastered the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the lifeforms on Earth from those of other planets-or even, perhaps, in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, and with only a handful of mainstream scientists willing or able to risk ridicule and loss of funding, people worldwide who are experiencing the UFO abduction phenomenon firsthand have little choice. They can only hope and pray that these alien beings know what they're doing. On the other hand, Hopkins cautions, in such a transaction the odds favor us losing and the aliens gaining. He states: The twenty-seven years I have spent working with abductees, listening to their traumatic encounters, and trying to help them heal a lifetime of psychic damage, have left me hardened to reassuring talk of beings of light practicing benevolent tough love. I have seen too much pain to allow myself more than a life-sustaining modicum of hope. And yet, I may be wrong. Though abductions inevitably leave the abductees scarred, emotionally and psychologically, there is no sign that this kind of psychic damage was intended. In fact, there are many indications that the UFO occupants try to minimize the pain and emotional damage their activities naturally inflict."

        "text_source": "It seems to many UFO abduction investigators that the latter remark describes precisely what seems to be lacking in both the ETs and in the transgenic beings we believe they are coproducing with our involuntary help. The evidently cloned children with alien-human appearance that Jen saw on the playground seemed passive, expressionless, and unused to the simplest of sensations-like the feel of sand trickling through one's fingers. It's no wonder these transgenic children seen aboard craft might be described as having the failure to thrive syndrome. They seem thin, listless, and nonresponsive. Do the aliens expect these children to take their places in our society as Mr. Paige and Damoe evidently did? Or do these children represent an interim stage in an overall alien plan to develop beings more like us in many ways-with our vital genetic diversity and our emotions, which actually have a survival purpose in our society. Or perhaps we flatter ourselves with this speculation, and all the ETs are interested in is getting the technical part right. They seem to have gone a long way toward producing serviceable facsimiles of humans who answer to them. The models seem to be getting better and better. The old debate still rages on over what is the most powerful influence to shape human beings (or any sentient being): Is it nature or nurture? But it's possible that both our great human vulnerability and our strength lies in our ongoing desire to attend to both equally. We earthlings value our science; we don't mind tinkering with nature if it seems to confer some genetic advantage on us, rather than the next guy; we're even drawn to some of the more radical new abilities of genetics to make designer babies free of defects. But we know that nature won't paint the whole picture, either-that these small bundles of neurons, muscles, blood, and bone, these offspring of ours, will also grow out of the environment we create and the examples we set. We will need to intentionally nurture our children into becoming loving, empathetic, and ethical adults, responsible to the rest of society. But what happens to a species like ours that might become infiltrated by a subpopulation of bioengineered people who never knew the nurturance side of the equation? ETs may be on the way to creating an increasingly perfect facsimile of a human being, but we don't yet see convincing evidence that they understand what lies behind the scenery of a fully fleshed-out human existence-qualities such as emotional openness, the courage to act independantly as a moral being, the desire to nurture others as you were once nurtured-or to nurture another person even if you were not. We don't know if this new variant species of mankind, intentionally created by the Other, is here to offer us earthlings fresh knowledge and profound insights from the farside of the cosmos, or whether it intends to deliberately betray us into the service of its own extraterrestrial creators. In the meantime, it seems that all we can do is to continue to bear witness and offer modest emotional support-through conversations, letters, phone calls, and writing-to the thousands of people undergoing these experiences. We, as well as the abductees, look toward the day that it dawns on the scientific, political, educational, and spiritual institutions of this small planet that their understanding and guidance are terribly lacking in dealing with this strange experience that touches every dimension of what it means to be human."

        "text_target": "There are those individuals in positions of power in commerce and government who are already in liaison with the Intervention. Their numbers will grow, and their strength and influence will grow if the Intervention is not stopped and if public education cannot be successfully generated. The next group of individuals who have been targeted are leaders of your religious organizations. Those amongst them who are deemed receptive and cooperative will be targeted and ideas and information will flow into their minds until such time as a direct encounter can be arranged. What will be offered to each of them is the promise that their particular religious organization and teaching will become predominant in a new world order. And even beyond that, it will be promised to each of them that their religious teaching, being greater than the others, will be able to extend beyond the world and have influence in the Greater Community itself. What devout religious leader could resist this temptation to have their tradition grow and extend even beyond the confines of this world? Not all leaders will be contacted. Only those who are deemed to be receptive and cooperative and who could become sympathetic and functional within the Intervention itself. Interventions are part of your own human history. We understand that such things have happened countless times. As greater nations attempt to overtake weaker ones, they seek to seduce the leaders of those weaker groups and nations with promises of power and authority and gifts of technology, mere trinkets. How effective this has been. Yet this is not unique to your world. It happens throughout the universe. Leaders of your religious organizations will be given the promise of pre-eminence in your world. Even their beliefs will be acknowledged, yet this is but deception again. The visitors do not care about your religions. They believe they are only the folly and the superstitions of humanity. Having no religion of their own that you could possibly recognize and understand, they will seek to use yours in order to garner your allegiance to them. The Collectives believe this is entirely ethical, for they believe that humanity will destroy the world without their Intervention. This is of course untrue, but this is their belief. And they feel that such methods are needed to secure the end that they are attempting to achieve. The Collectives justify these behaviors because they believe in the superiority of their race and in the necessity of their mission here in the world. Their thought is, Why let the natives ruin the world when we can run it for them and we can teach them the great value and benefit of our collective community? This is why you must not view the Intervention in a superstitious manner. The visitors are not angels, and they are not demons. They are driven by the same needs that drive humanity, and they will employ many of the same techniques that humanity has attempted to employ, though on a far lesser scale, in order to achieve their goals. Next, the inducement will be focused upon two distinct groups of individuals. Actually, these are not groups of individuals, but really classifications, of individuals. The first are those who are considered psychic and sensitive. The inducement here is to validate their sensitivity and to induce them into the collective mind of the Intervention itself. Here these individuals will be encouraged to support the Intervention, and their own beliefs regarding the frailties and the sinfulness of humanity will be encouraged. And their hope that some greater power from beyond the world will come to rescue humanity from its own demise will be greatly encouraged. Here it will be taught to them that they are part of a greater association of life that is demonstrated by the Intervention itself. Here their religious views and aspirations will be encouraged but directed towards the Collectives. These individuals will be told to trust in the extraterrestrial presence that is in the world, that it is here to uplift humanity, to transform humanity, and to rescue humanity from its own errors. They will be encouraged to become its representatives, to become its speakers, to inspire others to give their faith and their trust to the extraterrestrial presence and to become part of this movement in consciousness, this great evolutionary change that is occurring in their midst. Yet these individuals, without knowing the real nature or intentions of the Intervention, will unwittingly become its speakers and its representatives. Having become part of the visitors' Pacification Program, these people will now pacify others and bring them to the Intervention. So while the visitors seek liaison with individuals in positions of power in government and religion, they also seek to establish emissaries throughout the human population. For those sensitive individuals who cannot become receptive to and cooperative with the Intervention, their skills and abilities will be thwarted and offset. If such individuals begin to gain an insight into the real nature of the Intervention, they can become the target of real mental disruption. In addition, amongst the sensitives and the psychics, there will be a search for those few individuals living in the world today who have an inborn and intuitive awareness of the depositories. The search for these individuals is underway. The visitors understand that the key to human allegiance is the quest for power, wealth and spiritual fulfillment. Here people will operate against their own best interests if they believe that their activities are ordained and supported by a greater power. We have spoken of this already in our first series of discourses. Yet again we must elaborate on this point. Perhaps you will see those who claim to be psychic and sensitive being supportive and encouraging people to trust and to believe in the presence of the visitors, believing that the visitors represent a spiritual awareness, a spiritual force, even evolution itself. The visitors will tell them, Look, we have no war. We live in peace and cooperation. You have not achieved these things. Therefore, trust that we are able to give them to you and teach you the ways of cooperation and teach you how to live in peace, harmony and equanimity. Who amongst the idealistic can resist such a temptation, having lost faith in the human spirit? Having disavowed human institutions to a certain extent, they now look to the heavens for help, for inspiration and for salvation itself. And when they are taken by the visitors or contacted by the visitors, such predispositions put them in the perfect position to become receptive to the Intervention and to become emissaries for the Intervention. Those who will not cooperate will be given confusing information. They can even be tormented mentally unless they call upon the power of the Unseen Ones, the Angelic Presence, to help them. And they must gain a strong position of resistance to the Intervention with a real understanding of its motives. Our words will give them strength and encouragement. This in part is why our message is so urgently needed in the world today. The next group who will be contacted will be those who are zealous representatives of their own religious traditions. Their fundamentalism is very close in many respects to the philosophy and the mentality of the Collectives. The Collectives support only one view of reality and only one view of community, and they hold this in reverence almost to the point of it being a religious emphasis. Those people who are zealous, especially those who are filled with anger and resentment against the world and against those who they see oppose them, will become prime candidates to espouse a cooperation with the Collectives and the destruction of those who stand against the Collectives. This is a very difficult and dangerous situation, for the visitors will use human allegiance and their human emissaries to carry out their destructive activities in the world. It will not be the visitors who will destroy those who will not and cannot cooperate. It will be the visitors' human counterparts, their human representatives, who will carry out such destruction. In this way, the real nature and purpose of the Intervention remains hidden and such acts of violence will simply be attributed to human error and to human violence and demonstrate the need for the Intervention. For the visitors again will say, Look at these terrible acts of violence! We are not violent. We do not come with weapons of war. We do not destroy you. This is the result of human ignorance and human depravity. We will teach you how to outgrow all of these things. So even the violence that is perpetrated by the Intervention will be used by the visitors to support their superiority and to contribute to the illusion that they themselves do not use deception, manipulation or force to gain their advantage. Clearly, there are individuals in your world who are very zealous in representing their religious beliefs and aspirations. The Unseen Ones have told us much about this, and we of course have seen this in many other worlds. It is not unique to humankind. Yet it is a form of blind passion, and blind passion fueled by anger and hostility becomes a consuming force for the individual, a force which can be highly manipulated and is vulnerable to usurpation by the Intervention itself. Such zealous people will rally a movement of strict adherence and will draw out those who oppose such a strict adherence. Violence will be wrought upon the unbelievers, and they shall be cast aside. In this way, through the eyes of the Intervention, those who oppose the Intervention and those who cannot willingly support it will be identified and will be sorted out amongst the many people who dwell in your world. And the sifting will happen at the level of human interaction. In this way, the visitors will recognize their true adversaries and their potential adversaries. And having gained now a network of human representatives who are zealous in supporting and advancing their religious causes, the Intervention will use these individuals as the medium through which violence will be perpetrated. All the while, the visitors will remain seemingly above and beyond such activity and behavior. You may stop at this point and wonder, Well, how can such things occur? This seems so extreme! This seems so negative, so awful! But for anyone who has studied human history, you will see demonstrations of all of these things we are speaking of-religious manipulation, interbreeding, violence wrought upon adversaries, particularly in situations where native populations are encouraged to accept and to receive their new visitors. It is far easier to govern one who believes in your cause and is cooperative than it is one who is simply being subjugated. Humanity has great strength to throw off the shackles of subjugation. And so the Intervention will seek to use these inducements to gain as much cooperation and as much belief in their presence and in their cause as is possible. They will employ individuals in positions of power, those who have great sensitivities and psychic abilities and those who are zealous representatives of their religious traditions, to foster and generate such cooperation. For the vast majority of people in your world, the Intervention will be unknown and completely hidden. Yet for those who become aware of it, either because they have been taken, or because they have witnessed evidence of the Intervention in your world, these individuals will either be encouraged to believe and to support the Intervention or they will be cast aside and tormented by it. Already, there are individuals in your world, we understand, who have been cast aside and who are tormented, who have seen and felt and recognized things that they cannot incorporate into their understanding. Finding no compassion amongst their human fellows, they deteriorate into depression and into self-disassociation.",

        "text_target": "  We give greetings from far away now. In our first two sets of communications to you, we were able to be in the proximity of your world in a hidden location in your solar system. But now we have been forced to flee, since our revelations have become public. The Intervention that is occurring in your world by those extraterrestrial races who would seek to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity have searched for us, seeking to find us and to destroy us so that we may not report on their activities in the world and thus reveal their hidden plans and motivations. The people of your world must know that you are emerging now into a Greater Community of intelligent life, a Greater Community that you know nothing about and have not yet adapted to. It is a Greater Community of advanced worlds, for you live in a developed and populated part of the universe where large nations have established intricate and long-standing trade agreements with one another, where there are rules of engagement and rules of conduct that all trading nations in this region must observe. You know nothing of these things, of course, still being isolated within your world. Yet your world is being visited by small groups-small non-military groups, commercial forces, you might say-that are here seeking advantages and resources. They recognize that humanity at this moment is a weak and divided race and is superstitious and uneducated regarding the affairs of the Greater Community in which you have always lived. We have been sent as observers from several different free nations in this region of space, to observe the extraterrestrial Intervention that is occurring in the world today, to report on its activities and to reveal its hidden motives and agenda so that the human family might become aware and prepared for the reality of Contact. It is this reality of Contact that is essential for your understanding. Your world is a prize. It is greatly valued by others. You are unsuspecting and perhaps might assume that advanced technological races are advanced spiritually as well. But alas, this is not the case. The path of technological development, more often than not, leads away from real freedom and the true nature of spirituality as it exists in all manifest intelligent life. This represents but one of the important lessons that the human family must now learn if it is to regard the presence of foreign visitors with clarity, wisdom and discernment and if it is to recognize the great need for humanity to establish its own rules of engagement regarding all present and future visitations to your world. Such rules have not been established. Humanity stands naked in the universe, vulnerable to intervention and persuasion by small, cunning groups of resource explorers and economic Collectives-those who travel within the local universe seeking advantages and opportunities for themselves and for their clients. You of course have no way of understanding this, having never ventured far enough into space to witness these activities and to learn about the nature of interactions and commerce in this part of the universe. So you do not know what to expect, and in the absence of wisdom, clarity and informed awareness, many people who are aware of the Intervention are misunderstanding its presence and are construing it incorrectly, believing it is here for the benefit of humanity. It is because humanity has not responded with wisdom appropriately to this Intervention that we, as representatives of the free nations in your vicinity of space, have been sent here to observe this Intervention, to learn of its activities within your world and to reveal to you the nature of these activities, their purpose and indeed the nature of such Interventions as they so frequently occur everywhere in the Greater Community. You are emerging into a competitive environment in space, a complex environment, an environment where long-standing rules have been established to maintain stability amongst nations and worlds whose establishments are far older than anything that has been established on Earth. In this regard, you are but a young race, young and reckless- a young race who is beginning to experience the benefits and the liabilities of technological power; a young race who is despoiling a beautiful planet, a planet that is valued by others; a young race without wisdom and foresight who is eroding away its self-sufficiency-self-sufficiency which is always required for any emerging nation to maintain its freedom and its self-determination in the universe. There is so much now for humanity to learn and to do. Great actions must be taken, but they must be informed by a clear understanding of the universe into which you are emerging-how nations trade and function, what restrains them, what encourages them, the freedoms they have to intervene in a world such as yours and the restraints that prevent them from undertaking certain activities. Even now, though we are far from your world, we can report on these things and give you a clearer understanding of the nature of interaction, trade and commerce in your part of the galaxy, in this densely populated area of the universe. With this, we hope we can impart a great encouragement for the human family to utilize its native wisdom, to build upon its great strengths and to not fall prey to persuasion or self-deception that is always a great risk at thresholds such as these. Emerging into the Greater Community is the greatest threshold that any race can face. Many races fail at this threshold, falling under the persuasion and domination of foreign powers. Many nations fail because they have destroyed their self-sustaining resources and have become helpless and dependent upon others who, through leverage and through commercial manipulation, were able to gain control of these young, emerging races. It is a threshold with great risks and yet one with immense opportunities. In the face of the Greater Community, young races must unite, they must correct their destructive behavior, and they must focus on establishing the security of their world and its boundaries to space. We trust in this third set of Briefings that we may be able to illustrate the importance of this and provide our encouragement and our faith that humanity has the strength still and the integrity still to mount a great effort on its own behalf and to lay the foundation for becoming a free and self-determined race in the universe. For you must know that freedom is rare in the Greater Community and once it has been established, it must be carefully protected and watched over. Large nations that are not free, that do not provide freedom for their citizens, always regard the presence of free worlds and nations with great fear and suspicion. That is why free nations, with very few exceptions, maintain their autonomy and attempt not to become pulled into the complex and compromising nature of trade and commerce in the Greater Community. Perhaps you can understand this from your own experience of being in the world, a world where commerce has compromised the integrity and the self-determination of weaker nations. We have seen the evidence of this in your transmissions, which are foolishly sent out into space for all to see. We bring this example forward so that you may call upon your own experience and observations of the world because events in the Greater Community and the reality of the Greater Community itself represent the same kinds of forces, compromises and difficulties, but on a vastly larger scale with many more participants. Here you cannot be like children, being reckless, wasting your resources, opposing one another, being inattentive to your boundaries to space, unaware of who is intervening in your world today and foolishly expecting grace and salvation from those who might visit you. These are actions that are not in your best interest, actions which are governed by wishful thinking and by foolish and uninformed expectations. Such an approach to life in the universe will lay you open to deception and manipulation beyond what you are accustomed to and for which you have not yet developed a sufficient set of counter measures. Life in the universe is difficult because all advanced nations have outstripped their world's ability to sustain them, thus forcing them to engage in commerce and to a great degree to become controlled by other nations under whose commercial agreements they must now be forced to submit. Life in the universe is perilous for the unwary. And yet the Greater Community into which you are emerging is vast and magnificent, holding immense opportunities for learning and education and immense opportunities for self-discovery and for founding a world where greater unity must be established and can be established effectively.",
        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_target": "The first area of activity of the visitors is to influence individuals in positions of power and authority. Because the visitors do not want to destroy anything in the world or harm the world's resources, they seek to gain influence over those whom they perceive to be in positions of power, within government and religion primarily. They seek contact, but only with certain individuals. They have the power to make this contact, and they have the power of persuasion. Not all whom they contact will be persuaded, but many will be. The promise of greater power, greater technology and world domination will intrigue and incite many individuals. And it is these individuals with whom the visitors will seek to establish a liaison. There are very few people in the governments of the world who are being so affected, but their numbers are growing. The visitors understand the hierarchy of power because they themselves live by it, following their own chain of command, you might say. They are highly organized and very focused in their endeavors, and the idea of having cultures full of free-thinking individuals is largely foreign to them. They do not comprehend or understand individual freedom. They are like many technologically advanced societies in the Greater Community who function both within their respective worlds and in their establishments across vast reaches of space, utilizing a very well-established and rigid form of government and organization. They believe that humanity is chaotic and unruly, and they feel they are bringing order to a situation that they cannot themselves comprehend. Individual freedom is unknown to them, and they do not see its value. As a result, what they seek to establish in the world will not honor this freedom. Therefore, their first area of endeavor is to establish a liaison with individuals in positions of power and influence in order to gain their allegiance and to persuade them of the beneficial aspects of relationship and shared purpose. The second avenue of activity, which is perhaps the most difficult to consider from your perspective, is the manipulation of religious values and impulses. The visitors understand that humanity's greatest abilities also represent its greatest vulnerability. People's longing for individual redemption represents one of the greatest assets the human family has to offer, even to the Greater Community. But it is also your weakness. And it is these impulses and these values that will be used. Several groups of the visitors wish to establish themselves as spiritual agents because they know how to speak in the mental environment. They can communicate to people directly, and unfortunately, because there are very few people in the world who can discern the difference between a spiritual voice and the visitors' voice, the situation becomes very difficult. Therefore, the second area of activity is to gain people's allegiance through their religious and spiritual motivations. Actually, this can be done quite easily because humanity is not yet strong or developed in the mental environment. It is difficult for people to discern where these impulses are coming from. Many people want to give themselves to anything they think has a greater voice and a greater power. Your visitors can project images-images of your saints, of your teachers, of angels-images that are held dear and sacred within your world. They have cultivated this ability through many, many centuries of attempting to influence each other and by learning the ways of persuasion that are practiced in many places in the Greater Community. They consider you primitive, and so they feel they can exert this influence and use these methods upon you. Here there is an attempt to contact those individuals who are considered sensitive, receptive and naturally given to be cooperative. Many people will be selected, but a few will be chosen based upon these particular qualities. Your visitors will seek to gain allegiance with these individuals, to gain their trust and to gain their devotion, telling the recipients that the visitors are here to uplift humanity spiritually, to give humanity new hope, new blessings and new power-indeed promising the things that people want so dearly but have not yet found themselves. Perhaps you may wonder, How can such a thing occur? But we can assure you that it is not difficult once you learn these skills and abilities. The effort here is to pacify and to reeducate people through spiritual persuasion. This Pacification Program is used differently with different religious groups depending upon their ideals and their temperament. It is always aimed at receptive individuals. Here it is hoped that people will lose their sense of discernment and will become wholly trusting of the greater power that they feel is being given to them by the visitors. Once this allegiance is established, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to discern what they know within themselves from what is being told to them. It is a very subtle but very pervasive form of persuasion and manipulation. We shall speak more on this as we proceed. Let us now mention the third area of activity, which is to establish the visitors' presence in the world and to have people become used to this presence. They want humanity to become acclimated to this very great change that is occurring in your midst-to have you become acclimated to the visitors' physical presence and to their effect on your own mental environment. To serve this purpose, they will create establishments here, though not in view. These establishments will be hidden, but they will be very powerful in casting an influence on human populations that are near them. The visitors will take great care and time to make sure that these establishments are effective and that enough people are in allegiance to them. It is these people who will guard and preserve the visitors' presence. This is exactly what is occurring in your world at this time. It represents a great challenge and unfortunately a great risk. This very same thing that we are describing has happened so many times in so many places in the Greater Community. And emerging races such as your own are always the most vulnerable. Some emerging races are able to establish their own awareness, ability and cooperation to the extent that they can offset outside influences such as these and establish a presence and a position in the Greater Community. Yet many races, before they even attain this freedom, fall under the control and influence of foreign powers. We understand that this information may incite considerable fear and perhaps denial or confusion. But as we observe events, we realize that there are very few people who are aware of the situation as it actually exists. Even those people who are becoming aware of the presence of alien forces are not in a position and do not have the vantage point from which they can see the situation clearly. And being ever hopeful and optimistic, they seek to give this great phenomenon as much positive meaning as they can. However, the Greater Community is a competitive environment, a difficult environment. Those who engage in space travel do not necessarily represent the spiritually advanced, for those who are spiritually advanced seek insulation from the Greater Community. They do not seek commerce. They do not seek to influence other races or to engage in the very complex array of relationships that are established for mutual trade and benefit. Instead, the spiritually advanced seek to remain hidden. This is a very different understanding, perhaps, but a necessary one for you to come to comprehend the great predicament that humanity is facing. Yet this predicament holds great possibilities. We would like to speak about these now. Despite the gravity of the situation that we are describing, we do not feel that these circumstances are a tragedy for humanity. Indeed, if these circumstances can be recognized and understood, and if the preparation for the Greater Community, which now exists in the world, can be utilized, studied and applied, then people everywhere of good conscience will have the ability to learn Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom. Thus, people everywhere will be able to find the basis for cooperation so that the human family can finally establish a unity that has never been established here before. For it will take the overshadowing of the Greater Community to unite humanity. And this overshadowing is occurring now. It is your evolution to emerge into a Greater Community of intelligent life. It will happen whether you are prepared or not. It must occur. Preparation, then, becomes the key. Understanding and clarity-these are the things that are necessary and needed in your world at this time. People everywhere have great spiritual gifts that can enable them to see and to know clearly. These gifts are needed now. They need to be recognized, employed and shared freely. It is not merely up to a great teacher or a great saint in your world to do this. It must be cultivated by many more people now. For the situation brings with it necessity, and if necessity can be embraced, it brings with it great opportunity. However, the requirements to learn about the Greater Community and to begin to experience Greater Community Spirituality are tremendous. Never before have human beings had to learn such things in such a short period of time. Indeed, such things have rarely been learned ever by anyone in your world before. But now the need has changed. The circumstances are different. Now there are new influences in your midst, influences that you can feel and that you can know. The visitors seek to disable people from having this vision and this Knowledge within themselves, for your visitors do not have it within themselves. They do not see its value. They do not understand its reality. In this, humanity as a whole is more advanced than they are. But this is only a potential, a potential which must now be cultivated. The alien presence in the world is growing. It is growing every day, every year. Many more people are falling under its persuasion, losing their ability to know, becoming confused and distracted, believing in things that can only weaken them and make them impotent in the face of those who would seek to use them for their own purposes. Humanity is an emerging race. It is vulnerable. It is facing a set of circumstances and influences now which it has never had to face before. You have only evolved to compete with each other. You have never had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. Yet it is this competition that will strengthen you and will call forth your greatest attributes if the situation can be clearly seen and understood. It is the role of the Unseen Ones to foster this strength. The Unseen Ones, whom you would rightly call angels, do not only speak to the human heart but to hearts everywhere who are able to listen and who have gained the freedom to listen. We come, then, with a difficult message, but a message of promise and hope. Perhaps it is not the message that people want to hear. It is certainly not the message that the visitors would promote. It is a message that can be shared from person to person, and it will be shared because it is natural to do so. Yet the visitors and those who have come under their persuasion will oppose such an awareness. They do not want to see an independent humanity. That is not their purpose. They do not even believe it is beneficial. Therefore, it is our sincere desire that these ideas be considered without trepidation, but with a serious mind and a deep concern that are well justified here. There are many people in the world today, we understand, who feel that a great change is coming for humanity. The Unseen Ones have told us these things. Many causes are attributed to this sense of change. And many outcomes are predicted. Yet unless you can begin to comprehend the reality that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life, you do not yet have the right context for understanding the destiny of humanity or the great change that is occurring in the world. From our perspective, people are born into their time to serve that time. This is a teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, a teaching of which we are students as well. It teaches freedom and the power of shared purpose. It grants authority to the individual and to the individual who can join with others-ideas which are rarely accepted or adopted in the Greater Community, for the Greater Community is not the heavenly state. It is a physical reality with the rigors of survival and all that that entails. All beings within this reality must contend with these needs and issues. And in this, your visitors are more like you than you realize. They are not incomprehensible. They would seek to be incomprehensible, but they can be understood. You have the power to do this, but you must see with clear eyes. You must see with a greater vision and know with a greater intelligence, which you have the possibility to cultivate within yourselves. It is necessary for us now to speak more regarding the second area of influence and persuasion because this has great importance, and it is our sincere desire that you will understand these things and consider them for yourself. The religions of the world hold the key to human dedication and human allegiance, more than governments, more than any other institution. This speaks well for humanity because religions such as these are often hard to find in the Greater Community. Your world is rich in this respect, but your strength is also where you are weak and vulnerable. Many people want to be divinely guided and appointed, to give over the reins of their own lives and to have a greater spiritual power direct them, counsel them and preserve them. This is a genuine desire, but within a Greater Community context, considerable wisdom must be cultivated in order for this desire to be fulfilled. It is very sad for us to see how people will give their authority away so easily-something they have never even fully had, they will give away willingly to those who are unknown to them. This message is destined to reach people who have a greater spiritual affinity. Therefore, it is necessary that we elaborate on this subject. We advocate a spirituality that is taught in the Greater Community, not the spirituality that is governed by nations, governments or political alliances, but a natural spirituality-the ability to know, to see and to act. And yet this is not emphasized by your visitors. They seek to have people believe that the visitors are their family, that the visitors are their home, that the visitors are their brothers and sisters, their mothers and fathers. Many people want to believe, and so they believe. People want to give over their personal authority, and so it is given over. People want to see friends and salvation in the visitors, and so this is what they are shown. It will take great sobriety and objectivity in order to see through these deceptions and these difficulties. It will be necessary for people to do this if humanity is to successfully emerge into the Greater Community and maintain its freedom and its self-determination in an environment of greater influences and greater forces. In this, your world could be overtaken without firing a shot, for violence is considered primitive and crude and is rarely employed in matters such as this. Perhaps you may ask, Does this mean that there is an invasion of our world? We must say that the answer to this is yes, an invasion of the most subtle kind. If you can entertain these thoughts and consider them seriously, you will be able to see these things for yourself. The evidence of this invasion is everywhere. You can see how human ability is offset by the desire for happiness, peace and security, how people's vision and ability to know are hampered by influences even within their own cultures. How much greater these influences will be within a Greater Community environment. This is the difficult message that we must present. This is the message that must be said, the truth that must be spoken, the truth that is vital and cannot wait. It is so necessary for people now to learn a greater Knowledge, a greater Wisdom and a greater Spirituality so that they may find their true abilities and be able to use them effectively.",
        "text_source": "If the aliens are genuinely concerned with the fate of our planet, then it must be because they have some stake in it. Telling selected abductees that the environment is threatened is useless. The majority of them will not even remember the conversation, and most abductees are neither environmental nor political activists. Moreover, concern for the environment appears to be relatively new on the aliens' agenda. Researchers can date the abduction phenomenon directly to the late 1920s, and family stories suggest its origin in the 1890s. Were the aliens concerned about the environment when they began their Breeding Program at the turn of the century? If so, we have found no evidence suggesting this. It is most likely that the stratagem of environmental concern developed well after the Breeding Program was in place. Seen in this context, researchers must treat statements about the aliens' environmental concerns with utmost skepticism. It is entirely possible that they are using these pronouncements to justify the Breeding Program. They may also be using them to lend morality to their activities. If they can instill in abductees the idea that the human race will destroy itself and they are here to prevent that, then it becomes easier for them to defend their actions and to solicit help from the abductees. Almost as important, the environmental message paints the aliens as benevolent, which fits in nicely with what many humans so desperately want them to be. Is it not possible that the aliens are concerned about the environment because they want a clean Earth for themselves? The fact that humans live on a sullied planet does not seem important to them, but that they might have to live on a despoiled planet may be intolerable. Preventing Destruction  Images of mass destruction are extremely common during abductions-much more so than environmental images. Virtually every abductee has had to watch scenes of destruction. Tidal waves, floods, earthquakes, atomic bombs, and wars and their aftennaths abound. Devastated cities lie in rubble. Dead people are everywhere. Injured and dying men, women, and children cry out for help to the surviving abductee. Abductees are led to believe that this is going to happen, that it need not happen, and that humans have caused it. The aliens sometimes suggest a way to avoid destruction-themselves. They are working to avert this unhappy scenario. Their Breeding Program is the hope of the future and will lead to peace and contentment. They can bring about a happy ending to the horror. Patti Layne had this experience:  And they said, that they needed some parts, some things from me and that it would help everyone on the planet. They said that there are going to be some bad things that are going to happen. They gave me some pretty vivid images.... And I sat on the chair and they put this scope on my head.... They said that there are going to be some bad things that are going to happen. They told me terrible things would happen to the earth and that it would just blow up, and cities would crumble and mountains would fall and the sun would be black. And they said that it's bad because people can't stop being greedy and that they were doing something to help us, and I don't know how. I couldn't make the connection how putting something into my stomach would help us."

        "text_target": "  We give greetings from far away now. In our first two sets of communications to you, we were able to be in the proximity of your world in a hidden location in your solar system. But now we have been forced to flee, since our revelations have become public. The Intervention that is occurring in your world by those extraterrestrial races who would seek to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity have searched for us, seeking to find us and to destroy us so that we may not report on their activities in the world and thus reveal their hidden plans and motivations. The people of your world must know that you are emerging now into a Greater Community of intelligent life, a Greater Community that you know nothing about and have not yet adapted to. It is a Greater Community of advanced worlds, for you live in a developed and populated part of the universe where large nations have established intricate and long-standing trade agreements with one another, where there are rules of engagement and rules of conduct that all trading nations in this region must observe. You know nothing of these things, of course, still being isolated within your world. Yet your world is being visited by small groups-small non-military groups, commercial forces, you might say-that are here seeking advantages and resources. They recognize that humanity at this moment is a weak and divided race and is superstitious and uneducated regarding the affairs of the Greater Community in which you have always lived. We have been sent as observers from several different free nations in this region of space, to observe the extraterrestrial Intervention that is occurring in the world today, to report on its activities and to reveal its hidden motives and agenda so that the human family might become aware and prepared for the reality of Contact. It is this reality of Contact that is essential for your understanding. Your world is a prize. It is greatly valued by others. You are unsuspecting and perhaps might assume that advanced technological races are advanced spiritually as well. But alas, this is not the case. The path of technological development, more often than not, leads away from real freedom and the true nature of spirituality as it exists in all manifest intelligent life. This represents but one of the important lessons that the human family must now learn if it is to regard the presence of foreign visitors with clarity, wisdom and discernment and if it is to recognize the great need for humanity to establish its own rules of engagement regarding all present and future visitations to your world. Such rules have not been established. Humanity stands naked in the universe, vulnerable to intervention and persuasion by small, cunning groups of resource explorers and economic Collectives-those who travel within the local universe seeking advantages and opportunities for themselves and for their clients. You of course have no way of understanding this, having never ventured far enough into space to witness these activities and to learn about the nature of interactions and commerce in this part of the universe. So you do not know what to expect, and in the absence of wisdom, clarity and informed awareness, many people who are aware of the Intervention are misunderstanding its presence and are construing it incorrectly, believing it is here for the benefit of humanity. It is because humanity has not responded with wisdom appropriately to this Intervention that we, as representatives of the free nations in your vicinity of space, have been sent here to observe this Intervention, to learn of its activities within your world and to reveal to you the nature of these activities, their purpose and indeed the nature of such Interventions as they so frequently occur everywhere in the Greater Community. You are emerging into a competitive environment in space, a complex environment, an environment where long-standing rules have been established to maintain stability amongst nations and worlds whose establishments are far older than anything that has been established on Earth. In this regard, you are but a young race, young and reckless- a young race who is beginning to experience the benefits and the liabilities of technological power; a young race who is despoiling a beautiful planet, a planet that is valued by others; a young race without wisdom and foresight who is eroding away its self-sufficiency-self-sufficiency which is always required for any emerging nation to maintain its freedom and its self-determination in the universe. There is so much now for humanity to learn and to do. Great actions must be taken, but they must be informed by a clear understanding of the universe into which you are emerging-how nations trade and function, what restrains them, what encourages them, the freedoms they have to intervene in a world such as yours and the restraints that prevent them from undertaking certain activities. Even now, though we are far from your world, we can report on these things and give you a clearer understanding of the nature of interaction, trade and commerce in your part of the galaxy, in this densely populated area of the universe. With this, we hope we can impart a great encouragement for the human family to utilize its native wisdom, to build upon its great strengths and to not fall prey to persuasion or self-deception that is always a great risk at thresholds such as these. Emerging into the Greater Community is the greatest threshold that any race can face. Many races fail at this threshold, falling under the persuasion and domination of foreign powers. Many nations fail because they have destroyed their self-sustaining resources and have become helpless and dependent upon others who, through leverage and through commercial manipulation, were able to gain control of these young, emerging races. It is a threshold with great risks and yet one with immense opportunities. In the face of the Greater Community, young races must unite, they must correct their destructive behavior, and they must focus on establishing the security of their world and its boundaries to space. We trust in this third set of Briefings that we may be able to illustrate the importance of this and provide our encouragement and our faith that humanity has the strength still and the integrity still to mount a great effort on its own behalf and to lay the foundation for becoming a free and self-determined race in the universe. For you must know that freedom is rare in the Greater Community and once it has been established, it must be carefully protected and watched over. Large nations that are not free, that do not provide freedom for their citizens, always regard the presence of free worlds and nations with great fear and suspicion. That is why free nations, with very few exceptions, maintain their autonomy and attempt not to become pulled into the complex and compromising nature of trade and commerce in the Greater Community. Perhaps you can understand this from your own experience of being in the world, a world where commerce has compromised the integrity and the self-determination of weaker nations. We have seen the evidence of this in your transmissions, which are foolishly sent out into space for all to see. We bring this example forward so that you may call upon your own experience and observations of the world because events in the Greater Community and the reality of the Greater Community itself represent the same kinds of forces, compromises and difficulties, but on a vastly larger scale with many more participants. Here you cannot be like children, being reckless, wasting your resources, opposing one another, being inattentive to your boundaries to space, unaware of who is intervening in your world today and foolishly expecting grace and salvation from those who might visit you. These are actions that are not in your best interest, actions which are governed by wishful thinking and by foolish and uninformed expectations. Such an approach to life in the universe will lay you open to deception and manipulation beyond what you are accustomed to and for which you have not yet developed a sufficient set of counter measures. Life in the universe is difficult because all advanced nations have outstripped their world's ability to sustain them, thus forcing them to engage in commerce and to a great degree to become controlled by other nations under whose commercial agreements they must now be forced to submit. Life in the universe is perilous for the unwary. And yet the Greater Community into which you are emerging is vast and magnificent, holding immense opportunities for learning and education and immense opportunities for self-discovery and for founding a world where greater unity must be established and can be established effectively.",
        "text_source": "You'd know where all the treasures on Earth are buried. Bodies, too, most likely. What sort of being would you have to be to have such God-like powers? A being from the fifth dimension, just one level up from where we now perceive ourselves to be. Although the rest of us here in our 3-D world (plus space-time) would regard your powers as magical, you'd realize that it's just having a more advantageous perspective that makes such a difference. Some extraterrestrials somewhere may already know how to manipulate spacetime, although it's far in advance of anything we on Earth know how to do. But in the realm of hyperspace, all of these things are theoretically possible. Might these dimensions that scientists say are there but cannot be seen represent the scenery behind which our alien visitors come and go? Some physicists speculate that these extra dimensions might indeed account for paranormal phenomena. In this way, they could have a relevance to UFOs. One reason that UFOs seem to appear and disappear in and out of thin air (among the other possibilities explored earlier in this book) might be that they enter and exit our 3-D space by moving in another spatial dimension. Michael Murphy, in The Future of the Body, states that these hyperdimensional models of the universe have a resonance with esoteric accounts of extraspatial worlds in which our familiar existence is embedded, and from which phantom figures, luminosities, odors of sanctity, and other extrasomic phenomena materialize, and through which highly developed spirit-bodies move. Might our present movement abilities be analogous to those of early amphibians that had not learned to breathe or move freely on land? Many Worlds As early as 1957, the possibility was raised by physicists that during the evolution of the universe, it repeatedly split in half, each split like a fork in the road. If this is correct, the number of universes we might have to take into account are literally infinite. And each universe would be linked to every other at the points of the forks in the road. The many worlds theory allows that all possible quantum worlds exist. For example, in some worlds, humans exist as the dominant life-form on Earth. In other worlds, chemical reactions took place that prevented human life from evolving, and on this same planet another very different lifeform is the reigning species. Parallel Universes Physicist Stephen Hawking's theory of parallel universes takes the many worlds theory a bit further: He believes that there are an infinite number of self-contained universes and that wormholes offer the possibility of tunneling between them. But it's not likely that you'll soon be able to open a door and step into another, parallel universe where your boss never heard of you and your family doesn't know who you are. The connecting wormholes, which are now quite respectable topics of study for science, are thought to be extremely small, about the size of a Planck length-close to a one hundred billion times smaller than a proton. People who hate cramped travel situations might want to opt out of a trip to the neighboring universe until the technical details get worked out and a little more legroom is possible. 24 Multiple worlds are not thought to interact on a regular basis. Certain events, however, may cause tubes or wormholes to open up between them. Communication and travel between universes would then be possible. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) 25 Many physicists currently use quantum theory and experiments to describe the whole of reality as a multiverse that contains vast numbers of parallel or multiple universes. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) Wormholes through space could also be prime candidates for explaining how UFOs travel from one universe or solar system to another. Having mastered the difficulties of hyperspace, the UFO occupants (or their higher-intelligence leaders) would use these multiple tunnels constructed by nature to take a shortcut between their world and ours. The old argument You can't get here from there would no longer be valid. Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

        "text_source": "Apart from popular entertainment, however, UFOs have had other influences on our culture, mostly as a result of the cover-up. Most of these influences have been negative. For if we assume that UFOs are real, and there has been a cover-up, then it would be a cover-up that has permeated our society at nearly every level. It would mean that a major truth in our world has been suppressed, which in turn has damaged the willingness and ability of many people to investigate and see truth when it does appear. After all, if someone is used to taking the word of the established authorities on a particular subject, even when the facts do not agree, it can cause a disconnect or discrepancy between what one thinks reality is, and what it really is. The cover-up, however, may have produced one silver lining. We like to think of our species as able to handle the open acknowledgment of UFOs and other beings, but what if we really cannot, at least not without a serious crisis? This might especially be the case if we were to learn that there is some unpleasantness to the presence of these Others. If that is so, then we might conclude that the cover-up has preserved human culture to some extent, rather than allowing it to disintegrate within panic. I do not personally subscribe to this belief, but it is worth consideration. As substantial as the cultural impact of UFOs has been on our world so far, it is likely to be dwarfed by the end of the secrecy that envelops it. This has been something I have reflected on for some time. What I see is something no less than a replay of the 1960s, a decade when anything and everything seemed possible, when people developed a powerful distrust of their government, when they explored an array of alternative realities. This time, however, such a transformation will occur within the social and technological frameworks of the 21st century. A wild ride indeed. Because the major fact, sitting front row and center, will be the challenge, whether benign, benevolent or hostile, posed by the reality of highly advanced other beings here among us on Planet Earth. Global Implications   When we try to look further ahead into the post-Disclosure world, which is the theme of this book's final chapter, we arrive at the likelihood of political revolution. Whether or not this ultimately will be something positive for mankind is not something I would care to predict. If prior revolutions are our guide, the post-Disclosure Revolution will probably usher in developments both beneficial and malign. Clearly, though, a major alteration of human politics will be necessary on a global scale. This will be not merely in order to cope with these other beings, whoever they are and whatever they want, but also to deal with the new technologies that undoubtedly will arise in the aftermath. Quite probably, too, from the demands laid down by the people themselves for a new and, it is to be hoped, more open and transparent political system. Disclosure may be the signal to lay down an open form of global fascism, but it does not have to be that way. In the very long run, after Disclosure, humanity and our home Planet Earth will look very different than they do today. After all, we are already on an incredible trajectory. The disclosure of an extraterrestrial reality would only hasten the best of that. For better or for worse, ending the Big Secret will put us on the fast track."

First, there must be great evidence concerning the visitation to your world. We have been told that this is the case. Yet we have also been told by the Unseen Ones that people do not know how to understand the evidence and that they give it their own meaning-a meaning that they prefer to give it, a meaning that provides comfort and reassurance for the most part. We are certain that there is adequate evidence to verify that the Intervention is occurring in the world today if one takes the time to look and to investigate this matter. The fact that your governments or religious leaders do not reveal such things does not mean that such a great event is not occurring in your midst. ~  How can people know that you are real? Regarding our reality, we cannot demonstrate our physical presence to you, and so you must discern the meaning and the import of our words. At this point, it is not merely a matter of belief. It requires a greater recognition, a Knowledge, a resonance. The words we speak we believe are true, but that does not assure that they can be received as such. We cannot control the response to our message. There are people who require more evidence than can possibly be given. For others, such evidence will not be necessary, for they will feel an inner confirmation. In the meantime, perhaps we remain a controversy, and yet we hope and we trust that our words can be considered seriously and that the evidence that does exist, which is substantial, can be gathered and understood by those who are willing to give this their effort and their focus in life. From our perspective, there is no greater problem, challenge and opportunity to receive your attention. Therefore, you are at the beginning of a new understanding. This does require faith and self-reliance. Many will reject our words simply because they do not believe that we could possibly exist. Others perhaps will think that we are part of some manipulation that is being cast upon the world. We cannot control these responses. We can only reveal our message and our presence in your life, however removed that presence may be. It is not our presence here that is of paramount importance, but the message that we have come to reveal and the greater perspective and understanding that we can provide for you. Your education must begin somewhere. All education begins with the desire to know. We hope that through our discourses we can gain at least part of your confidence in order to begin to reveal what we are here to offer. ~  What do you have to say to those who view the Intervention as a positive thing? We understand, first of all, the expectation that all forces from the heavens are related to your spiritual understanding, traditions and fundamental beliefs. The idea that there is prosaic life in the universe is a challenge to these fundamental assumptions. From our perspective and given the experience of our own cultures, we understand these expectations. In the distant past, we maintained them ourselves. And yet we had to relinquish them in facing the realities of Greater Community life and the meaning of visitation. You live in a great physical universe. It is full of life. This life represents countless manifestations and also represents the evolution of intelligence and spiritual awareness at every level. What this means is that what you will encounter in the Greater Community encompasses almost every possibility. However, you are isolated and do not yet travel in space. And even if you had the capability to reach another world, the universe is vast, and no one has gained the ability to go from one end of the galaxy to the other with any kind of speed. Therefore, the physical universe remains enormous and incomprehensible. No one has mastered its laws. No one has conquered its territories. No one can claim complete dominance or control. Life has a great humbling effect in this way. Even far beyond your borders this is true. You should then come to expect that you will meet intelligences representing forces for good, forces for ignorance and those who are more neutral regarding you. However, in the realities of Greater Community travel and exploration, emerging races such as your own will, almost without exception, encounter resource explorers, collectives and those seeking advantage for themselves as their first contact with Greater Community life. Regarding the positive interpretation of visitation, part of this is human expectation and the natural desire to welcome a good outcome and to seek help from the Greater Community for the problems that humanity has not been able to resolve on its own. It is normal to expect such things, particularly when you are considering that your visitors have greater capabilities than do you. However, a large part of the problem in interpreting the great visitation has to do with the will and the agenda of the visitors themselves. For they are encouraging people everywhere to view their presence here as wholly beneficial to humanity and to its needs.",
        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

        "text_source": "In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_source": "In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

        "text_target": "How perfect this is for the alien agenda. It takes time, but from their perspective, well, the results are worth it. The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from. In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it. This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family. There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted. And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth. Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated? Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God's punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God's will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done. Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people's sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged-not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power. How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn the Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it's coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust? The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference. People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, Jesus has come to me. And the Jesus says, You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others! And the zealous follower says, Yes, Master, yes, Master! Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention. Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people's religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know. It is humanity's ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity's Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new. This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people. This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction. As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies' message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people's inability to respond. It's like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don't know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, Well, it's just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them. This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all. Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing. Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it's not happening. There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth. Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone! Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, This is what it is! without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today. We encourage the development of people's discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about. We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world. Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it's facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.",
        "text_source": "For researchers, the question of choosing whether to know what is happening has other ramifications. I have struggled with this problem for many years. It is a close call, but my sense is that it is better to know than not to know. Without knowledge, we are completely at the aliens' mercy. With proper knowledge, we may think of options to delay or impede their program. I think this is worthwhile. And helping abductees struggle with what is happening to them is the human thing to do. If enough intelligent, knowledgeable people put their minds to the problem, there may be a remote possibility that they can stop the aliens, or at least slow them down.108 But something of that nature will not be realized as long as academics, scientists, and especially neuroscientists-who might be able to decipher the mysteries of memory storage and reclamation-not only disregard the abduction phenomenon, but also think it to be a direct indication of mendacity or mental instability. And, even if we accept the idea of alien infiltration, it may be either technologically impossible or already too late to make a difference. The one thing that gives hope for efforts to disrupt the aliens is that they remain secretive. This implies weakness somewhere in their program that humans can exploit. Taking advantage of that weakness, however, is unlikely unless the scientific community participates-and that is extremely improbable. The Future  Accurately predicting the future is usually a futile task, but I will try to speculate about a few of the more pertinent and obvious ideas. Unfortunately, no matter how I look at them, none have happy endings. The worst-case future is a sudden physical destruction or removal of the human species as we know it, even though the aliens specifically say this will not happen. It would be accompanied by a repopulation of hybrids, hubrids, and perhaps insectalins. This could be The Change. The evidence for this grandiose and seemingly science fiction assertion is slight, but the idea must be considered, no matter how ridiculous it seems."

        "text_target": "That is why uncharted territories remain uncharted, for space exploration is only peripheral and is never carried very far. Ships require fuel. Fuel cannot be resupplied. Explorers enter regions where there are unknown forces. Explorers encounter environmental and logistical problems. Visiting terrestrial planets always has a biological hazard if they contain a large biological presence. Many groups have become sickened and have perished. Travel in the universe is a very difficult and formidable task. Its distances are incredibly vast, and once you leave a known territory, you are on your own. If you do not have proper charting and maps, becoming lost is very easy, and finding your way back very difficult. Nations use transmitters to communicate with distant travelers, but beyond a certain distance, it is impossible to locate a ship. This represents the limits of technology, limits that the human family has not reached. The human family dreams of unlimited power and abilities in the universe, thinking they can go wherever they want, do whatever they want and meet whomever they want. But, alas, the reality is so very different. There is no race that is shepherding humanity as if you were the children and they were the parents. Yet you have potential allies whom you may engage with in the future, if ever you are to establish and maintain the three requirements for freedom that we have mentioned. At this point, humanity is not ready for Contact, and that is one of the reasons why the Intervention is inappropriate and unethical. Humanity is unable to engage wisely with the Greater Community. It lacks the maturity, the unity, the strength and the discernment to be able to do this effectively. To engage with humanity under these circumstances is to take advantage of its weakness and its lack of wisdom and expertise. You cannot help a young race by interfering and trying to control its destiny, and no nation that is wise would try to attempt this. Those that do are here for their own purposes and are seeking the fulfillment of their own goals. Humanity has built up layers of expectation, fantasy and belief that make it impossible for you to contemplate the reality of life beyond your borders or to see that the Greater Community is an expression of nature on a vast and incomprehensible scale. Here the laws of nature still continue and still limit the movements and the behavior of races. Technology cannot overcome this completely. Many people may be disappointed by the universe that we are presenting, but this is the real universe that you will have to contend with, and you ignore the gifts of this vision at your own peril. The Greater Community is not a human universe governed by human values, human aspirations, human wishes or human history. Even the races close to you, relatively speaking, in this region of space are entirely different in appearance, in thought, in behavior, in the structure of their societies and civilization and in their emphasis. They would be incomprehensible to you, as you are incomprehensible to them. Humanity is viewed by those few races who pay attention to this world as being chaotic, unruly and potentially dangerous. You are certainly not highly regarded for the way the Earth is being exploited and its wealth is being plundered. You do not realize how valuable a tree is in the Greater Community, how valuable seeds are, the great need for fluids from plants and animals and the problem in securing biological resources and rare metals. That is why humanity is viewed as reckless and without wisdom. Even though your competitors have no regard for you, your allies recognize the power of Knowledge that exists within the human family and its potential to guide you in the right direction and to prevent you from being easily seduced or to succumbing to your own weakness or to the persuasions of other races who would take advantage of your situation and your circumstances. Your focus on war is entirely inappropriate in the Greater Community that you will encounter, where violence is extremely rare and is greatly suppressed. You will not be able to go out into the universe to exploit all the resources you have destroyed here on Earth without engaging yourself permanently in a complex network of trade and commerce, over which you will have little or no authority. These are some of the corrections that must be made if humanity is to approach the Greater Community objectively, utilizing your awareness of nature, your awareness of your own history, the history of intervention in your world and what native peoples must do to establish their sovereignty and their self-determination amidst the presence of foreign and unanticipated powers. Do not think that your subjugation represents your destiny. Do not believe that another race will come and govern you with wisdom and compassion. Do not think that gaining ever higher levels of technology will assure you any greater advantage in the Greater Community. Beyond the requirements of establishing your unity, your self-sufficiency and your discretion, technology becomes ever more hazardous. It begins to work against everything you have created for yourself. Your greatest defense against exploitive powers in the universe is your unity, your self-sufficiency and your discretion. Certain levels of technology will have to be established to meet the needs of humanity in the future and to discern the presence of foreign visitors. But because you live in a well-inhabited region of space, you have certain advantages that prevent others from attempting to use force against you. As races evolve, they begin to realize that force is destructive and that persuasion is far more beneficial, though perhaps more time consuming. This represents their strength and your weakness. But because Knowledge is alive within you, this weakness can be overcome.",
        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

It is not simply that they want you to be a work force for them; they want you to become a part of them. This adds to their collective strength and will minimize any resistance in the future that humanity might mount for its own sake. This is why there is such a great investment of time and energy in gaining human allegiance, in bonding with humanity through interbreeding and in establishing a deep and pervasive association with the human family. This world is so valuable that the Intervention does not want to risk a human revolution in the future. Such revolutions have happened before. We can attest to this from our own experience. We are the product of such revolutions in our own worlds. Though our circumstances were quite different from yours, the nature of the Intervention and the methods employed were actually quite similar. This is why we can speak with authority on this subject. The inducements that will be brought to bear will be varied, depending on who is being reached and for what purpose. For individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative in the halls of government, the inducement will be the promise of greater power and technology. Humanity is in a very vulnerable position in this sense because its belief in technology and its hope that technology will solve all of its problems are very, very strong. This of course has been supported by the Intervention because this is one of the primary avenues in which humanity will likely become dependent on the Intervention itself. To those in the corridors of power in your governments, those individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative, the promise of greater technology and even world dominion will be presented. This can be presented either through the Mental Environment as ideas sent into the minds of these individuals, or, as has already occurred, there may be face-to-face encounters with the visitors themselves. And what will they offer humanity? They will offer humanity some of their basic technology, certainly nothing that they consider to be advanced, unique, secret or sacred to them-basic propulsion in space, basic use of electronic energy, methodologies of production. They will not teach power in the Mental Environment, for they do not want humanity to have this power unless it is completely controlled and directed by the visitors themselves.",
        "text_source": "Christianity is a bit different, and there are obvious, identifiable rifts within it. The Roman Catholic church, on the one hand, has for the past few decades gone out of its way to promote the idea of extraterrestrial life. Quite a few statements have issued from the Vatican supporting the notion of an abundance of life in the universe as part of God's great plan. On the other hand, many evangelical Christians will interpret any alleged extraterrestrial presence as demonic. Several passages from the New Testament have been used to support this position. New Age beliefs are different still. Most self-described New Agers are inclined to look at these other beings in a positive light, as humanity's benefactors and even space brothers. Since the 1970s, such beliefs have spread throughout the world, and certainly into the UFO subculture. There is no bridge long enough to join this viewpoint with that of the evangelicals. The rift is irreconcilable and only two things can resolve it. One is an overwhelming amount of new information that will satisfy people to form an opinion. The other is time: time for new generations to arise, with new perspectives that cannot now even be predicted. People can change, but deep changes that affect entire societies can come only from new generations. Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear. Current research into abductions and other forms of contact hint not only that space and time have somehow been mastered by these other beings, but that the mind is a critical element in their relationship to us. In this case, by consciousness we mean something that is nonlocal, something like psi phenomena. A series of well-funded scientific studies of the telepathic elements of contact, for instance, could be valuable additions to our knowledge of the mind and of the fabric of our reality. It would also allow science possibly to catch up with what many psychics and intuitives already believe, and even provide a useful framework to help us understand why psi phenomena occurs. Belief in psi is not just a woo woo belief, but supported by research into remote viewing, and goes back through all human religions via the power of prayer and meditation. Ultimately, we want to know if consciousness is more than just our brain chemistry, and whether or not we have a spirit or soul. Some might argue that a study of UFO data does not necessarily warrant that belief. I think, however, there is a case to be made that it does. If so, then human consciousness studies will become more widespread, and many new discoveries will await us. Such sciences, anything from remote viewing to out of body travel and space-time manipulation, are probably being explored now within the black budget world and breakaway civilization. Computing and Technology   We have had a global internet for just over twenty years, during which time it has completely changed our world. Whether or not there is a disclosure about UFOs, it will continue to do so."

        "text_target": "How perfect this is for the alien agenda. It takes time, but from their perspective, well, the results are worth it. The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from. In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it. This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family. There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted. And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth. Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated? Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God's punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God's will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done. Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people's sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged-not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power. How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn the Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it's coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust? The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference. People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, Jesus has come to me. And the Jesus says, You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others! And the zealous follower says, Yes, Master, yes, Master! Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention. Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people's religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know. It is humanity's ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity's Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new. This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people. This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction. As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies' message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people's inability to respond. It's like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don't know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, Well, it's just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them. This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all. Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing. Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it's not happening. There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth. Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone! Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, This is what it is! without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today. We encourage the development of people's discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about. We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world. Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it's facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.",
        "text_source": "Apart from popular entertainment, however, UFOs have had other influences on our culture, mostly as a result of the cover-up. Most of these influences have been negative. For if we assume that UFOs are real, and there has been a cover-up, then it would be a cover-up that has permeated our society at nearly every level. It would mean that a major truth in our world has been suppressed, which in turn has damaged the willingness and ability of many people to investigate and see truth when it does appear. After all, if someone is used to taking the word of the established authorities on a particular subject, even when the facts do not agree, it can cause a disconnect or discrepancy between what one thinks reality is, and what it really is. The cover-up, however, may have produced one silver lining. We like to think of our species as able to handle the open acknowledgment of UFOs and other beings, but what if we really cannot, at least not without a serious crisis? This might especially be the case if we were to learn that there is some unpleasantness to the presence of these Others. If that is so, then we might conclude that the cover-up has preserved human culture to some extent, rather than allowing it to disintegrate within panic. I do not personally subscribe to this belief, but it is worth consideration. As substantial as the cultural impact of UFOs has been on our world so far, it is likely to be dwarfed by the end of the secrecy that envelops it. This has been something I have reflected on for some time. What I see is something no less than a replay of the 1960s, a decade when anything and everything seemed possible, when people developed a powerful distrust of their government, when they explored an array of alternative realities. This time, however, such a transformation will occur within the social and technological frameworks of the 21st century. A wild ride indeed. Because the major fact, sitting front row and center, will be the challenge, whether benign, benevolent or hostile, posed by the reality of highly advanced other beings here among us on Planet Earth. Global Implications   When we try to look further ahead into the post-Disclosure world, which is the theme of this book's final chapter, we arrive at the likelihood of political revolution. Whether or not this ultimately will be something positive for mankind is not something I would care to predict. If prior revolutions are our guide, the post-Disclosure Revolution will probably usher in developments both beneficial and malign. Clearly, though, a major alteration of human politics will be necessary on a global scale. This will be not merely in order to cope with these other beings, whoever they are and whatever they want, but also to deal with the new technologies that undoubtedly will arise in the aftermath. Quite probably, too, from the demands laid down by the people themselves for a new and, it is to be hoped, more open and transparent political system. Disclosure may be the signal to lay down an open form of global fascism, but it does not have to be that way. In the very long run, after Disclosure, humanity and our home Planet Earth will look very different than they do today. After all, we are already on an incredible trajectory. The disclosure of an extraterrestrial reality would only hasten the best of that. For better or for worse, ending the Big Secret will put us on the fast track."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "They didn't feel it was appropriate to stare at the aliens too much. They look so dignified, said Alan. One appeared slightly shorter than the other. They seemed frail, though Thomas sensed a latent strength about them. Half an hour later, all of the team having seen the beings and returned to the office, the officer/instructor declared that he didn't know which sex the aliens were. He thought they wore a membranous covering, but added that the Americans hadn't been very forthcoming with their information. He suggested that the team gave names to the aliens if they wanted, but that officially they were referred to by their American captors as G32 and G33. Thomas speculates that the numbers might relate to the 32nd and 33rd aliens recovered by the U.S. military. The team elected to call them simply G and L. (Much later, it was determined that G was male, L female.) Thomas remains amazed at the aliens' ability to convey a sense of humor, or sadness, for example, without such feelings manifesting facially. As time went by, it became possible to feel their thoughts, and it was always clear what they meant. They did speak audibly on occasions-not that it helped. The problem in our inability to converse by voice was that their language contained no vowels, he explained; thus, if they spoke to us we would hear a series of unintelligible sounds not unlike the chattering of small animals. (However, the airmen later learned from their duty officer that although official communications from G and L did not involve actual spoken words, the Americans confirmed that they do have voices-presumably capable of communicating in English and other languages.) Thomas and the others liked the aliens from the outset and grew to care for them deeply over the approximately twenty-month period involved. One lovely summer's day, Thomas and Alan were sitting beside the Grays (as they apparently were referred to occasionally by the military, even at that time), surveying the countryside through the large window of their enclosure. What is worrying you both? said the aliens. Is this not the kind of day when you should feel all is well? The men were indeed worried-about the aliens. Thanks to you airmen, we are doing well and recovering, the Grays responded. You need not worry about us. When communicating, G and L would put one hand on their chest, to convey who was speaking. Then began a discourse, warning of Earth's future overpopulation, the poisoning of its environment, and so on. We know your instructions are to inform your seniors of all we say. Do so. We will be telling them all we have told you when they pay their regular visits. . . .  Like other alien groups, they confirmed Man's extraterrestrial genetic links. The majority of flora and fauna on this planet have evolved over millions of years. Humans were one of those that were genetically manipulated and thus you are related to another species as a planned experiment by beings from another world. Our presence here is of right, and we have visited before this time, many times. Our present role is to observe others who are here, to see that they are not destructive and to give you some of our technology in order that you will survive-if you have earned the right to survival as we judge it. That was the core of our message to Earth people and part of the reason for our arrival in your time of 1947, though we reneged upon that in that July month, and here two of us remain-at least for a little longer. At this juncture, G reached out and clasped hands with L. I felt there was significance in the comment 'at least for a little longer,' linked with the hand clasp, writes Thomas. The two aliens had been held captive for at least eight years. Not much of an existence for people who know how to travel light years' distance, and had somehow done so to reach Earth. The Code Orange team were never present when the aliens took their meals. Although some thin tubes were present in their glass enclosure, their purpose was indeterminable. Waste matter, perhaps? Eventually, G and L, having picked up the men's bewilderment, communicated some details. You have been wondering if we feed, and how we do so. We know your seniors have not told you. Knowledge is important to all life. . . .  We feed on blood, and water. Yes, I can feel your reaction, but our race does not digest solids. . . . Both liquids are available on this planet and we partake of small amounts of each in order to survive. We also breathe your air, though it is clearer in some regions of your planet than others. Your seniors obtain enough food for our needs and provide us with it in your absence."

        "text_target": "Indeed, beyond this, the Collectives that are functioning in the world today want to add a human component to their collective community and mentality. It is not simply that they want you to be a work force for them; they want you to become a part of them. This adds to their collective strength and will minimize any resistance in the future that humanity might mount for its own sake. This is why there is such a great investment of time and energy in gaining human allegiance, in bonding with humanity through interbreeding and in establishing a deep and pervasive association with the human family. This world is so valuable that the Intervention does not want to risk a human revolution in the future. Such revolutions have happened before. We can attest to this from our own experience. We are the product of such revolutions in our own worlds. Though our circumstances were quite different from yours, the nature of the Intervention and the methods employed were actually quite similar. This is why we can speak with authority on this subject. The inducements that will be brought to bear will be varied, depending on who is being reached and for what purpose. For individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative in the halls of government, the inducement will be the promise of greater power and technology. Humanity is in a very vulnerable position in this sense because its belief in technology and its hope that technology will solve all of its problems are very, very strong. This of course has been supported by the Intervention because this is one of the primary avenues in which humanity will likely become dependent on the Intervention itself. To those in the corridors of power in your governments, those individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative, the promise of greater technology and even world dominion will be presented. This can be presented either through the Mental Environment as ideas sent into the minds of these individuals, or, as has already occurred, there may be face-to-face encounters with the visitors themselves. And what will they offer humanity? They will offer humanity some of their basic technology, certainly nothing that they consider to be advanced, unique, secret or sacred to them-basic propulsion in space, basic use of electronic energy, methodologies of production. They will not teach power in the Mental Environment, for they do not want humanity to have this power unless it is completely controlled and directed by the visitors themselves.",
        "text_source": "Though science has inadvertently become our ally, too many individual scientists remain mired in past attitudes. Indifference to an objective consideration of the mass of available UFO data is still the norm. It is our profound hope that Sight Unseen will alert open-minded members of the scientific community to the need to join in this crucially important investigation. Our second goal in writing this book is to provide enough specific information about the aliens' behavior on our planet to enable readers to form their own judgments about its intent and its future course. We have presented nearly a score of UFO abduction cases and provided many verbatim transcripts of the abductees' interviews, letters, and hypnotic sessions. As most of our readers are probably aware, the actual range of this firsthand testimony is far more consistent than the bewildering range of opinions theorists have issued about the meaning of it all. On one end of the scale is what we might call the ultraparanoid interpretation: that the aliens are demons, beings who have come here to capture and devour our children, to use human body parts as replacements, and to feast upon what General Buck Turgison in Dr. Strangelove called our vital bodily fluids. There is not, in our opinion, a scintilla of evidence supporting such a dire and melodramatic reading of the data. On the other end of the spectrum is the idea-hope is perhaps a better word-that the aliens are here as quasi-godlike beings to help us with our problems, to heal our damaged planet, and to offer what has been called, with a straight face, unconditional love. No one who reads the accounts we have been presenting can come to such a rosy- and simplistic-conclusion. The truth is, of course, that we do not know the future. We do not know the aliens' ultimate intentions, nor do we really know what their options are. As the reader may have discerned, Hopkins and Rainey have somewhat differing views about alien intent. We do not share the same balance between hope and pessimism. On the one hand, Rainey suggests: What the ETs may be creating are not hybrids at all but transgenic human beings. It is both biologically possible and would best fit the profile of a secretive, invasive force that might be intent on conquering us from within-or equally possible, healing or altering the genes that no longer work for us in our present environment. The change could happen one genetic code word at a time-or an entire chromosome at a time. Either way, if the genes to be modified were carefully and expertly selected over thousands of years, we might never notice what was happening. The Hollywood-style massive destruction and cultural devastation seen in the movie Independence Day would never have to be played out. Biologists tell us that an entire species can do most of its changing internally, with new species traits only gradually manifesting themselves in outward appearance and behavior. If this is indeed occurring, will these alterations be good for the humans-or bad for the humans? This is a difficult issue to take in both emotionally and intellectually: The subtle but inexorable alteration of the human species. But it may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own has already mastered the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the lifeforms on Earth from those of other planets-or even, perhaps, in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, and with only a handful of mainstream scientists willing or able to risk ridicule and loss of funding, people worldwide who are experiencing the UFO abduction phenomenon firsthand have little choice. They can only hope and pray that these alien beings know what they're doing. On the other hand, Hopkins cautions, in such a transaction the odds favor us losing and the aliens gaining. He states: The twenty-seven years I have spent working with abductees, listening to their traumatic encounters, and trying to help them heal a lifetime of psychic damage, have left me hardened to reassuring talk of beings of light practicing benevolent tough love. I have seen too much pain to allow myself more than a life-sustaining modicum of hope. And yet, I may be wrong. Though abductions inevitably leave the abductees scarred, emotionally and psychologically, there is no sign that this kind of psychic damage was intended. In fact, there are many indications that the UFO occupants try to minimize the pain and emotional damage their activities naturally inflict."

Thanks to you airmen, we are doing well and recovering, the Grays responded. You need not worry about us. When communicating, G and L would put one hand on their chest, to convey who was speaking. Then began a discourse, warning of Earth's future overpopulation, the poisoning of its environment, and so on. We know your instructions are to inform your seniors of all we say. Do so. We will be telling them all we have told you when they pay their regular visits. . . .  Like other alien groups, they confirmed Man's extraterrestrial genetic links. The majority of flora and fauna on this planet have evolved over millions of years. Humans were one of those that were genetically manipulated and thus you are related to another species as a planned experiment by beings from another world. Our presence here is of right, and we have visited before this time, many times. Our present role is to observe others who are here, to see that they are not destructive and to give you some of our technology in order that you will survive-if you have earned the right to survival as we judge it. That was the core of our message to Earth people and part of the reason for our arrival in your time of 1947, though we reneged upon that in that July month, and here two of us remain-at least for a little longer. At this juncture, G reached out and clasped hands with L. I felt there was significance in the comment 'at least for a little longer,' linked with the hand clasp, writes Thomas. The two aliens had been held captive for at least eight years. Not much of an existence for people who know how to travel light years' distance, and had somehow done so to reach Earth. The Code Orange team were never present when the aliens took their meals. Although some thin tubes were present in their glass enclosure, their purpose was indeterminable. Waste matter, perhaps? Eventually, G and L, having picked up the men's bewilderment, communicated some details. You have been wondering if we feed, and how we do so. We know your seniors have not told you. Knowledge is important to all life. . . .  We feed on blood, and water. Yes, I can feel your reaction, but our race does not digest solids. . . . Both liquids are available on this planet and we partake of small amounts of each in order to survive. We also breathe your air, though it is clearer in some regions of your planet than others. Your seniors obtain enough food for our needs and provide us with it in your absence."

        "text_target": "The first area of activity of the visitors is to influence individuals in positions of power and authority. Because the visitors do not want to destroy anything in the world or harm the world's resources, they seek to gain influence over those whom they perceive to be in positions of power, within government and religion primarily. They seek contact, but only with certain individuals. They have the power to make this contact, and they have the power of persuasion. Not all whom they contact will be persuaded, but many will be. The promise of greater power, greater technology and world domination will intrigue and incite many individuals. And it is these individuals with whom the visitors will seek to establish a liaison. There are very few people in the governments of the world who are being so affected, but their numbers are growing. The visitors understand the hierarchy of power because they themselves live by it, following their own chain of command, you might say. They are highly organized and very focused in their endeavors, and the idea of having cultures full of free-thinking individuals is largely foreign to them. They do not comprehend or understand individual freedom. They are like many technologically advanced societies in the Greater Community who function both within their respective worlds and in their establishments across vast reaches of space, utilizing a very well-established and rigid form of government and organization. They believe that humanity is chaotic and unruly, and they feel they are bringing order to a situation that they cannot themselves comprehend. Individual freedom is unknown to them, and they do not see its value. As a result, what they seek to establish in the world will not honor this freedom. Therefore, their first area of endeavor is to establish a liaison with individuals in positions of power and influence in order to gain their allegiance and to persuade them of the beneficial aspects of relationship and shared purpose. The second avenue of activity, which is perhaps the most difficult to consider from your perspective, is the manipulation of religious values and impulses. The visitors understand that humanity's greatest abilities also represent its greatest vulnerability. People's longing for individual redemption represents one of the greatest assets the human family has to offer, even to the Greater Community. But it is also your weakness. And it is these impulses and these values that will be used. Several groups of the visitors wish to establish themselves as spiritual agents because they know how to speak in the mental environment. They can communicate to people directly, and unfortunately, because there are very few people in the world who can discern the difference between a spiritual voice and the visitors' voice, the situation becomes very difficult. Therefore, the second area of activity is to gain people's allegiance through their religious and spiritual motivations. Actually, this can be done quite easily because humanity is not yet strong or developed in the mental environment. It is difficult for people to discern where these impulses are coming from. Many people want to give themselves to anything they think has a greater voice and a greater power. Your visitors can project images-images of your saints, of your teachers, of angels-images that are held dear and sacred within your world. They have cultivated this ability through many, many centuries of attempting to influence each other and by learning the ways of persuasion that are practiced in many places in the Greater Community. They consider you primitive, and so they feel they can exert this influence and use these methods upon you. Here there is an attempt to contact those individuals who are considered sensitive, receptive and naturally given to be cooperative. Many people will be selected, but a few will be chosen based upon these particular qualities. Your visitors will seek to gain allegiance with these individuals, to gain their trust and to gain their devotion, telling the recipients that the visitors are here to uplift humanity spiritually, to give humanity new hope, new blessings and new power-indeed promising the things that people want so dearly but have not yet found themselves. Perhaps you may wonder, How can such a thing occur? But we can assure you that it is not difficult once you learn these skills and abilities. The effort here is to pacify and to reeducate people through spiritual persuasion. This Pacification Program is used differently with different religious groups depending upon their ideals and their temperament. It is always aimed at receptive individuals. Here it is hoped that people will lose their sense of discernment and will become wholly trusting of the greater power that they feel is being given to them by the visitors. Once this allegiance is established, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to discern what they know within themselves from what is being told to them. It is a very subtle but very pervasive form of persuasion and manipulation. We shall speak more on this as we proceed. Let us now mention the third area of activity, which is to establish the visitors' presence in the world and to have people become used to this presence. They want humanity to become acclimated to this very great change that is occurring in your midst-to have you become acclimated to the visitors' physical presence and to their effect on your own mental environment. To serve this purpose, they will create establishments here, though not in view. These establishments will be hidden, but they will be very powerful in casting an influence on human populations that are near them. The visitors will take great care and time to make sure that these establishments are effective and that enough people are in allegiance to them. It is these people who will guard and preserve the visitors' presence. This is exactly what is occurring in your world at this time. It represents a great challenge and unfortunately a great risk. This very same thing that we are describing has happened so many times in so many places in the Greater Community. And emerging races such as your own are always the most vulnerable. Some emerging races are able to establish their own awareness, ability and cooperation to the extent that they can offset outside influences such as these and establish a presence and a position in the Greater Community. Yet many races, before they even attain this freedom, fall under the control and influence of foreign powers. We understand that this information may incite considerable fear and perhaps denial or confusion. But as we observe events, we realize that there are very few people who are aware of the situation as it actually exists. Even those people who are becoming aware of the presence of alien forces are not in a position and do not have the vantage point from which they can see the situation clearly. And being ever hopeful and optimistic, they seek to give this great phenomenon as much positive meaning as they can. However, the Greater Community is a competitive environment, a difficult environment. Those who engage in space travel do not necessarily represent the spiritually advanced, for those who are spiritually advanced seek insulation from the Greater Community. They do not seek commerce. They do not seek to influence other races or to engage in the very complex array of relationships that are established for mutual trade and benefit. Instead, the spiritually advanced seek to remain hidden. This is a very different understanding, perhaps, but a necessary one for you to come to comprehend the great predicament that humanity is facing. Yet this predicament holds great possibilities. We would like to speak about these now. Despite the gravity of the situation that we are describing, we do not feel that these circumstances are a tragedy for humanity. Indeed, if these circumstances can be recognized and understood, and if the preparation for the Greater Community, which now exists in the world, can be utilized, studied and applied, then people everywhere of good conscience will have the ability to learn Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom. Thus, people everywhere will be able to find the basis for cooperation so that the human family can finally establish a unity that has never been established here before. For it will take the overshadowing of the Greater Community to unite humanity. And this overshadowing is occurring now. It is your evolution to emerge into a Greater Community of intelligent life. It will happen whether you are prepared or not. It must occur. Preparation, then, becomes the key. Understanding and clarity-these are the things that are necessary and needed in your world at this time. People everywhere have great spiritual gifts that can enable them to see and to know clearly. These gifts are needed now. They need to be recognized, employed and shared freely. It is not merely up to a great teacher or a great saint in your world to do this. It must be cultivated by many more people now. For the situation brings with it necessity, and if necessity can be embraced, it brings with it great opportunity. However, the requirements to learn about the Greater Community and to begin to experience Greater Community Spirituality are tremendous. Never before have human beings had to learn such things in such a short period of time. Indeed, such things have rarely been learned ever by anyone in your world before. But now the need has changed. The circumstances are different. Now there are new influences in your midst, influences that you can feel and that you can know. The visitors seek to disable people from having this vision and this Knowledge within themselves, for your visitors do not have it within themselves. They do not see its value. They do not understand its reality. In this, humanity as a whole is more advanced than they are. But this is only a potential, a potential which must now be cultivated. The alien presence in the world is growing. It is growing every day, every year. Many more people are falling under its persuasion, losing their ability to know, becoming confused and distracted, believing in things that can only weaken them and make them impotent in the face of those who would seek to use them for their own purposes. Humanity is an emerging race. It is vulnerable. It is facing a set of circumstances and influences now which it has never had to face before. You have only evolved to compete with each other. You have never had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. Yet it is this competition that will strengthen you and will call forth your greatest attributes if the situation can be clearly seen and understood. It is the role of the Unseen Ones to foster this strength. The Unseen Ones, whom you would rightly call angels, do not only speak to the human heart but to hearts everywhere who are able to listen and who have gained the freedom to listen. We come, then, with a difficult message, but a message of promise and hope. Perhaps it is not the message that people want to hear. It is certainly not the message that the visitors would promote. It is a message that can be shared from person to person, and it will be shared because it is natural to do so. Yet the visitors and those who have come under their persuasion will oppose such an awareness. They do not want to see an independent humanity. That is not their purpose. They do not even believe it is beneficial. Therefore, it is our sincere desire that these ideas be considered without trepidation, but with a serious mind and a deep concern that are well justified here. There are many people in the world today, we understand, who feel that a great change is coming for humanity. The Unseen Ones have told us these things. Many causes are attributed to this sense of change. And many outcomes are predicted. Yet unless you can begin to comprehend the reality that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life, you do not yet have the right context for understanding the destiny of humanity or the great change that is occurring in the world. From our perspective, people are born into their time to serve that time. This is a teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, a teaching of which we are students as well. It teaches freedom and the power of shared purpose. It grants authority to the individual and to the individual who can join with others-ideas which are rarely accepted or adopted in the Greater Community, for the Greater Community is not the heavenly state. It is a physical reality with the rigors of survival and all that that entails. All beings within this reality must contend with these needs and issues. And in this, your visitors are more like you than you realize. They are not incomprehensible. They would seek to be incomprehensible, but they can be understood. You have the power to do this, but you must see with clear eyes. You must see with a greater vision and know with a greater intelligence, which you have the possibility to cultivate within yourselves. It is necessary for us now to speak more regarding the second area of influence and persuasion because this has great importance, and it is our sincere desire that you will understand these things and consider them for yourself. The religions of the world hold the key to human dedication and human allegiance, more than governments, more than any other institution. This speaks well for humanity because religions such as these are often hard to find in the Greater Community. Your world is rich in this respect, but your strength is also where you are weak and vulnerable. Many people want to be divinely guided and appointed, to give over the reins of their own lives and to have a greater spiritual power direct them, counsel them and preserve them. This is a genuine desire, but within a Greater Community context, considerable wisdom must be cultivated in order for this desire to be fulfilled. It is very sad for us to see how people will give their authority away so easily-something they have never even fully had, they will give away willingly to those who are unknown to them. This message is destined to reach people who have a greater spiritual affinity. Therefore, it is necessary that we elaborate on this subject. We advocate a spirituality that is taught in the Greater Community, not the spirituality that is governed by nations, governments or political alliances, but a natural spirituality-the ability to know, to see and to act. And yet this is not emphasized by your visitors. They seek to have people believe that the visitors are their family, that the visitors are their home, that the visitors are their brothers and sisters, their mothers and fathers. Many people want to believe, and so they believe. People want to give over their personal authority, and so it is given over. People want to see friends and salvation in the visitors, and so this is what they are shown. It will take great sobriety and objectivity in order to see through these deceptions and these difficulties. It will be necessary for people to do this if humanity is to successfully emerge into the Greater Community and maintain its freedom and its self-determination in an environment of greater influences and greater forces. In this, your world could be overtaken without firing a shot, for violence is considered primitive and crude and is rarely employed in matters such as this. Perhaps you may ask, Does this mean that there is an invasion of our world? We must say that the answer to this is yes, an invasion of the most subtle kind. If you can entertain these thoughts and consider them seriously, you will be able to see these things for yourself. The evidence of this invasion is everywhere. You can see how human ability is offset by the desire for happiness, peace and security, how people's vision and ability to know are hampered by influences even within their own cultures. How much greater these influences will be within a Greater Community environment. This is the difficult message that we must present. This is the message that must be said, the truth that must be spoken, the truth that is vital and cannot wait. It is so necessary for people now to learn a greater Knowledge, a greater Wisdom and a greater Spirituality so that they may find their true abilities and be able to use them effectively.",
        "text_source": "It seems to many UFO abduction investigators that the latter remark describes precisely what seems to be lacking in both the ETs and in the transgenic beings we believe they are coproducing with our involuntary help. The evidently cloned children with alien-human appearance that Jen saw on the playground seemed passive, expressionless, and unused to the simplest of sensations-like the feel of sand trickling through one's fingers. It's no wonder these transgenic children seen aboard craft might be described as having the failure to thrive syndrome. They seem thin, listless, and nonresponsive. Do the aliens expect these children to take their places in our society as Mr. Paige and Damoe evidently did? Or do these children represent an interim stage in an overall alien plan to develop beings more like us in many ways-with our vital genetic diversity and our emotions, which actually have a survival purpose in our society. Or perhaps we flatter ourselves with this speculation, and all the ETs are interested in is getting the technical part right. They seem to have gone a long way toward producing serviceable facsimiles of humans who answer to them. The models seem to be getting better and better. The old debate still rages on over what is the most powerful influence to shape human beings (or any sentient being): Is it nature or nurture? But it's possible that both our great human vulnerability and our strength lies in our ongoing desire to attend to both equally. We earthlings value our science; we don't mind tinkering with nature if it seems to confer some genetic advantage on us, rather than the next guy; we're even drawn to some of the more radical new abilities of genetics to make designer babies free of defects. But we know that nature won't paint the whole picture, either-that these small bundles of neurons, muscles, blood, and bone, these offspring of ours, will also grow out of the environment we create and the examples we set. We will need to intentionally nurture our children into becoming loving, empathetic, and ethical adults, responsible to the rest of society. But what happens to a species like ours that might become infiltrated by a subpopulation of bioengineered people who never knew the nurturance side of the equation? ETs may be on the way to creating an increasingly perfect facsimile of a human being, but we don't yet see convincing evidence that they understand what lies behind the scenery of a fully fleshed-out human existence-qualities such as emotional openness, the courage to act independantly as a moral being, the desire to nurture others as you were once nurtured-or to nurture another person even if you were not. We don't know if this new variant species of mankind, intentionally created by the Other, is here to offer us earthlings fresh knowledge and profound insights from the farside of the cosmos, or whether it intends to deliberately betray us into the service of its own extraterrestrial creators. In the meantime, it seems that all we can do is to continue to bear witness and offer modest emotional support-through conversations, letters, phone calls, and writing-to the thousands of people undergoing these experiences. We, as well as the abductees, look toward the day that it dawns on the scientific, political, educational, and spiritual institutions of this small planet that their understanding and guidance are terribly lacking in dealing with this strange experience that touches every dimension of what it means to be human."

        "text_source": "This conversation happened some decades ago, and humanity's rapid technological development might now reduce eons to mere centuries. Still, the story resonates with me, simply because I know the source, as well as a few things about the career of this officer. Consider what eons and eons might mean. After Disclosure, these other beings are still likely to be so far ahead of us that open contact between us and them, open communication of any sort, might well remain inconceivable. The irony of Disclosure could well be that we will continue to have many unanswered questions about exactly who and what we are dealing with. We will have gotten to a point where we can prove to ourselves openly as a society that they are here, yes. But that is different from being able to grab hold of a live one for open study. Fighting the black budget world would probably offer the most hope on this matter, but it may well take an extended struggle to make that happen, perhaps many years. It is also quite possible that whatever bodies are being held make up only a small piece of the grand puzzle of what constitutes these Others. Very likely, the real action after Disclosure will be dealing with issues internal to our own society. It may well be that at least some of these beings have established a residence on our world. There is certainly reason to believe, gained from countless insider leaks and claims, that there is communication of some sort between them and the black budget community. There are also claims, and good reason to consider, that some of them have insinuated themselves into our society, perhaps even our power structure. Why would that be so illogical? On the contrary, it would seem to be entirely logical. They would know that humanity is on the fast track, and that when we get to the point where we might prove to be a genuine annoyance, all the more reason for them to have their own people on the inside. In the post-Disclosure world, this question will be raised more than once. There will be no easy way around it. Disclosure of the UFO reality will force our civilization to resolve many longstanding challenges and problems. Looking at only a few of these, it is easy to see why secrecy on this matter has been paramount for so long. Uncovering it will be the most revolutionary act in human history. The Long View   Looking further ahead into the future, we can discern some contours of that distant shore. It will be a world with an open recognition of the presence of other, alien intelligences here on Earth, interacting with this planet and humanity. That will be out in the open. Whether they will be out in the open is another matter altogether. But its open acknowledgement will be a great spur to our intellectual development. The dominant technologies a century from now will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to recognize today. Computing power and artificial intelligence will be orders of magnitude greater. Human beings themselves are likely to be different in many ways. Placing a value judgement on this is probably pointless. For better or worse, we are on the cusp of a great change. We will see changes not merely to our technological infrastructure, but probably to our own species via gene therapy and other forms of biotech. The basic intelligence of at least a portion of humanity (the very well-to-do) is likely to increase greatly. Envisioning the future in such a world is difficult. In all likelihood, we will still have families, love relationships, and a physical need for food, sleep, and sex. On that basis, we may assume that humans a century from now will share basic traits with us. Yet, how much do we have in common today with a medieval peasant or a paleolithic hunter-gatherer? Certain things, yes, but we also inhabit a vastly different mental universe. It seems likely that our great-great grandchildren, at least some of them, will be that far ahead of us."

        "text_target": "There are those individuals in positions of power in commerce and government who are already in liaison with the Intervention. Their numbers will grow, and their strength and influence will grow if the Intervention is not stopped and if public education cannot be successfully generated. The next group of individuals who have been targeted are leaders of your religious organizations. Those amongst them who are deemed receptive and cooperative will be targeted and ideas and information will flow into their minds until such time as a direct encounter can be arranged. What will be offered to each of them is the promise that their particular religious organization and teaching will become predominant in a new world order. And even beyond that, it will be promised to each of them that their religious teaching, being greater than the others, will be able to extend beyond the world and have influence in the Greater Community itself. What devout religious leader could resist this temptation to have their tradition grow and extend even beyond the confines of this world? Not all leaders will be contacted. Only those who are deemed to be receptive and cooperative and who could become sympathetic and functional within the Intervention itself. Interventions are part of your own human history. We understand that such things have happened countless times. As greater nations attempt to overtake weaker ones, they seek to seduce the leaders of those weaker groups and nations with promises of power and authority and gifts of technology, mere trinkets. How effective this has been. Yet this is not unique to your world. It happens throughout the universe. Leaders of your religious organizations will be given the promise of pre-eminence in your world. Even their beliefs will be acknowledged, yet this is but deception again. The visitors do not care about your religions. They believe they are only the folly and the superstitions of humanity. Having no religion of their own that you could possibly recognize and understand, they will seek to use yours in order to garner your allegiance to them. The Collectives believe this is entirely ethical, for they believe that humanity will destroy the world without their Intervention. This is of course untrue, but this is their belief. And they feel that such methods are needed to secure the end that they are attempting to achieve. The Collectives justify these behaviors because they believe in the superiority of their race and in the necessity of their mission here in the world. Their thought is, Why let the natives ruin the world when we can run it for them and we can teach them the great value and benefit of our collective community? This is why you must not view the Intervention in a superstitious manner. The visitors are not angels, and they are not demons. They are driven by the same needs that drive humanity, and they will employ many of the same techniques that humanity has attempted to employ, though on a far lesser scale, in order to achieve their goals. Next, the inducement will be focused upon two distinct groups of individuals. Actually, these are not groups of individuals, but really classifications, of individuals. The first are those who are considered psychic and sensitive. The inducement here is to validate their sensitivity and to induce them into the collective mind of the Intervention itself. Here these individuals will be encouraged to support the Intervention, and their own beliefs regarding the frailties and the sinfulness of humanity will be encouraged. And their hope that some greater power from beyond the world will come to rescue humanity from its own demise will be greatly encouraged. Here it will be taught to them that they are part of a greater association of life that is demonstrated by the Intervention itself. Here their religious views and aspirations will be encouraged but directed towards the Collectives. These individuals will be told to trust in the extraterrestrial presence that is in the world, that it is here to uplift humanity, to transform humanity, and to rescue humanity from its own errors. They will be encouraged to become its representatives, to become its speakers, to inspire others to give their faith and their trust to the extraterrestrial presence and to become part of this movement in consciousness, this great evolutionary change that is occurring in their midst. Yet these individuals, without knowing the real nature or intentions of the Intervention, will unwittingly become its speakers and its representatives. Having become part of the visitors' Pacification Program, these people will now pacify others and bring them to the Intervention. So while the visitors seek liaison with individuals in positions of power in government and religion, they also seek to establish emissaries throughout the human population. For those sensitive individuals who cannot become receptive to and cooperative with the Intervention, their skills and abilities will be thwarted and offset. If such individuals begin to gain an insight into the real nature of the Intervention, they can become the target of real mental disruption. In addition, amongst the sensitives and the psychics, there will be a search for those few individuals living in the world today who have an inborn and intuitive awareness of the depositories. The search for these individuals is underway. The visitors understand that the key to human allegiance is the quest for power, wealth and spiritual fulfillment. Here people will operate against their own best interests if they believe that their activities are ordained and supported by a greater power. We have spoken of this already in our first series of discourses. Yet again we must elaborate on this point. Perhaps you will see those who claim to be psychic and sensitive being supportive and encouraging people to trust and to believe in the presence of the visitors, believing that the visitors represent a spiritual awareness, a spiritual force, even evolution itself. The visitors will tell them, Look, we have no war. We live in peace and cooperation. You have not achieved these things. Therefore, trust that we are able to give them to you and teach you the ways of cooperation and teach you how to live in peace, harmony and equanimity. Who amongst the idealistic can resist such a temptation, having lost faith in the human spirit? Having disavowed human institutions to a certain extent, they now look to the heavens for help, for inspiration and for salvation itself. And when they are taken by the visitors or contacted by the visitors, such predispositions put them in the perfect position to become receptive to the Intervention and to become emissaries for the Intervention. Those who will not cooperate will be given confusing information. They can even be tormented mentally unless they call upon the power of the Unseen Ones, the Angelic Presence, to help them. And they must gain a strong position of resistance to the Intervention with a real understanding of its motives. Our words will give them strength and encouragement. This in part is why our message is so urgently needed in the world today. The next group who will be contacted will be those who are zealous representatives of their own religious traditions. Their fundamentalism is very close in many respects to the philosophy and the mentality of the Collectives. The Collectives support only one view of reality and only one view of community, and they hold this in reverence almost to the point of it being a religious emphasis. Those people who are zealous, especially those who are filled with anger and resentment against the world and against those who they see oppose them, will become prime candidates to espouse a cooperation with the Collectives and the destruction of those who stand against the Collectives. This is a very difficult and dangerous situation, for the visitors will use human allegiance and their human emissaries to carry out their destructive activities in the world. It will not be the visitors who will destroy those who will not and cannot cooperate. It will be the visitors' human counterparts, their human representatives, who will carry out such destruction. In this way, the real nature and purpose of the Intervention remains hidden and such acts of violence will simply be attributed to human error and to human violence and demonstrate the need for the Intervention. For the visitors again will say, Look at these terrible acts of violence! We are not violent. We do not come with weapons of war. We do not destroy you. This is the result of human ignorance and human depravity. We will teach you how to outgrow all of these things. So even the violence that is perpetrated by the Intervention will be used by the visitors to support their superiority and to contribute to the illusion that they themselves do not use deception, manipulation or force to gain their advantage. Clearly, there are individuals in your world who are very zealous in representing their religious beliefs and aspirations. The Unseen Ones have told us much about this, and we of course have seen this in many other worlds. It is not unique to humankind. Yet it is a form of blind passion, and blind passion fueled by anger and hostility becomes a consuming force for the individual, a force which can be highly manipulated and is vulnerable to usurpation by the Intervention itself. Such zealous people will rally a movement of strict adherence and will draw out those who oppose such a strict adherence. Violence will be wrought upon the unbelievers, and they shall be cast aside. In this way, through the eyes of the Intervention, those who oppose the Intervention and those who cannot willingly support it will be identified and will be sorted out amongst the many people who dwell in your world. And the sifting will happen at the level of human interaction. In this way, the visitors will recognize their true adversaries and their potential adversaries. And having gained now a network of human representatives who are zealous in supporting and advancing their religious causes, the Intervention will use these individuals as the medium through which violence will be perpetrated. All the while, the visitors will remain seemingly above and beyond such activity and behavior. You may stop at this point and wonder, Well, how can such things occur? This seems so extreme! This seems so negative, so awful! But for anyone who has studied human history, you will see demonstrations of all of these things we are speaking of-religious manipulation, interbreeding, violence wrought upon adversaries, particularly in situations where native populations are encouraged to accept and to receive their new visitors. It is far easier to govern one who believes in your cause and is cooperative than it is one who is simply being subjugated. Humanity has great strength to throw off the shackles of subjugation. And so the Intervention will seek to use these inducements to gain as much cooperation and as much belief in their presence and in their cause as is possible. They will employ individuals in positions of power, those who have great sensitivities and psychic abilities and those who are zealous representatives of their religious traditions, to foster and generate such cooperation. For the vast majority of people in your world, the Intervention will be unknown and completely hidden. Yet for those who become aware of it, either because they have been taken, or because they have witnessed evidence of the Intervention in your world, these individuals will either be encouraged to believe and to support the Intervention or they will be cast aside and tormented by it. Already, there are individuals in your world, we understand, who have been cast aside and who are tormented, who have seen and felt and recognized things that they cannot incorporate into their understanding. Finding no compassion amongst their human fellows, they deteriorate into depression and into self-disassociation.",
        "text_source": "In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

        "text_source": "Suddenly, the man explained that the true purpose of his visit was to impart some important information:  I am not from this planet, but don't be nervous, he began. It is necessary that you people recognize that many of us are here intermingled with you, and trying to help, because you are very close to having tremendous problems on your planet... You are misusing energy sources and it is necessary for you to learn to find another source of energy. We are trying to give you this information because you are polluting the atmosphere: You are contaminating not only your planet but even space, and are very close to being destroyed. . . . Dr. Diaz questioned why he was being given this information, rather than government officials and scientists, and was told: We have approached your government people and your scientists, but many are very arrogant. They don't want to hear; they don't want to change. We are trying to help, but only in the way you want to receive this help. We cannot force you to accept. . . . There followed a lengthy discourse on cosmology, theology, and physics. The alien's comments on the energy crisis were particularly apposite. It is necessary for you to find another energy source, he said, and it is very easy. For that which you call electricity is an eternal energy ... it is free. It is possible to get tremendous energy if you know how to dissociate electrons, for in this way you can have the free energy you need, without contamination or pollution, and this is what we use to travel space. . . . The stranger revealed that his people had discovered more subatomic particles than we had, hence their ability to tap this source of energy. Before the man left the office, Dr. Diaz attempted to learn his origin, but other than saying that our solar system has twelve planets, the alien merely stated cryptically: The only thing I can tell you is that I come from beyond the sun. . . .  At the conclusion of this conversation, held in Spanish, the stranger left the office. Dr. Diaz attempted to follow, but by the time he reached the corner of the block, the man had vanished. At first, Dr. Diaz related this experience only to a few close friends and relatives, but subsequendy he was introduced to the UFO Education Center in California, where he learned that others had claimed to have had encounters with extraterrestrials. In the realization that he was not alone, he felt secure enough to make the story public- and even to make a special trip to New York, where he related the details to a United Nations delegation. There will be those who will arbitrarily reject this sensational account without further consideration. Others will cast aspersions on the doctor's state of mental health or integrity, accusing him of fabricating the story for self-aggrandizement. But it is hardly likely that a highly respected doctor, who up to that time had been in practice for over twenty-five years, would risk his professional reputation with such a story unless it had actually taken place. When I spoke with Dr. Diaz by phone in 1980, he struck me as being completely truthful, and gave me the names of some of the United Nations delegates with whom he had spoken in New York. The meeting had taken place in the office of Robert Muller, under secretary of economic and social development, and accordingly, I telephoned him at the United Nations. Mr. Muller confirmed the meeting with Dr. Diaz, but when I asked what the United Nations proposed to do about it, he replied: Nothing -nothing at all. I circulated it to some people who might be able to do something about it and I had not a single response. A GERMAN CONNECTION  We find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto assumed, and whose base of operations is at present unknown to us, Dr. Wernher von Braun is alleged to have stated in 1959, in reference to the deflection from orbit of a United States satellite. More I cannot say at present. We are now engaged in entering into closer contact with those powers, and in six or nine months' time it may be possible to speak with more precision on the matter. Whether Von Braun had aliens in mind may never be known, but in view of information I have acquired over the years from reliable sources, indicating that contact has been established with a number of scientists, the possibility cannot be discounted. A colleague of mine, for example, learned from a scientist friend in the 1970s that the director of a German/American space research center (located in West Germany) was of allegedly extraterrestrial origin. This knowledge was restricted to a quorum of scientists at the base, and the information apparently supplied by the director proved to be invaluable in their research effort. Just another wild, unsubstantiated story? Perhaps. But I have to add that my colleague had the opportunity of meeting the director in London in the 1980s (together with his scientist friend) and is satisfied as to the director's credentials. Even Germany's great space pioneer Dr. Hermann Oberth is reported to have endorsed the suggestion of alien liaison. We cannot take the credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fields alone; we have been helped, he is quoted as having said. When asked by whom, he simply replied, The people of other worlds.27 To my great regret, I neglected to ask Oberth about this when I met him in 1972, but I recall that he did not reject the possibility that aliens might have established bases here on Earth. DANGEROUS LIAISONS  But alien contact is infinitely more complex than the scenario suggested here. Having spent over thirty years interviewing many witnesses throughout the world, it is evident to me that we are confronted with a diversity of UFO occupants, and I see no valid reason for discarding one type of report on the basis of its failure to fit in with our preconceived notions of alien appearance and behavior."

We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves.

Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings.",
        "text_source": "Christianity is a bit different, and there are obvious, identifiable rifts within it. The Roman Catholic church, on the one hand, has for the past few decades gone out of its way to promote the idea of extraterrestrial life. Quite a few statements have issued from the Vatican supporting the notion of an abundance of life in the universe as part of God's great plan. On the other hand, many evangelical Christians will interpret any alleged extraterrestrial presence as demonic. Several passages from the New Testament have been used to support this position. New Age beliefs are different still. Most self-described New Agers are inclined to look at these other beings in a positive light, as humanity's benefactors and even space brothers. Since the 1970s, such beliefs have spread throughout the world, and certainly into the UFO subculture. There is no bridge long enough to join this viewpoint with that of the evangelicals. The rift is irreconcilable and only two things can resolve it. One is an overwhelming amount of new information that will satisfy people to form an opinion. The other is time: time for new generations to arise, with new perspectives that cannot now even be predicted. People can change, but deep changes that affect entire societies can come only from new generations. Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear. Current research into abductions and other forms of contact hint not only that space and time have somehow been mastered by these other beings, but that the mind is a critical element in their relationship to us. In this case, by consciousness we mean something that is nonlocal, something like psi phenomena. A series of well-funded scientific studies of the telepathic elements of contact, for instance, could be valuable additions to our knowledge of the mind and of the fabric of our reality. It would also allow science possibly to catch up with what many psychics and intuitives already believe, and even provide a useful framework to help us understand why psi phenomena occurs. Belief in psi is not just a woo woo belief, but supported by research into remote viewing, and goes back through all human religions via the power of prayer and meditation. Ultimately, we want to know if consciousness is more than just our brain chemistry, and whether or not we have a spirit or soul. Some might argue that a study of UFO data does not necessarily warrant that belief. I think, however, there is a case to be made that it does. If so, then human consciousness studies will become more widespread, and many new discoveries will await us. Such sciences, anything from remote viewing to out of body travel and space-time manipulation, are probably being explored now within the black budget world and breakaway civilization. Computing and Technology   We have had a global internet for just over twenty years, during which time it has completely changed our world. Whether or not there is a disclosure about UFOs, it will continue to do so."

        "text_source": "Suddenly, the man explained that the true purpose of his visit was to impart some important information:  I am not from this planet, but don't be nervous, he began. It is necessary that you people recognize that many of us are here intermingled with you, and trying to help, because you are very close to having tremendous problems on your planet... You are misusing energy sources and it is necessary for you to learn to find another source of energy. We are trying to give you this information because you are polluting the atmosphere: You are contaminating not only your planet but even space, and are very close to being destroyed. . . . Dr. Diaz questioned why he was being given this information, rather than government officials and scientists, and was told: We have approached your government people and your scientists, but many are very arrogant. They don't want to hear; they don't want to change. We are trying to help, but only in the way you want to receive this help. We cannot force you to accept. . . . There followed a lengthy discourse on cosmology, theology, and physics. The alien's comments on the energy crisis were particularly apposite. It is necessary for you to find another energy source, he said, and it is very easy. For that which you call electricity is an eternal energy ... it is free. It is possible to get tremendous energy if you know how to dissociate electrons, for in this way you can have the free energy you need, without contamination or pollution, and this is what we use to travel space. . . . The stranger revealed that his people had discovered more subatomic particles than we had, hence their ability to tap this source of energy. Before the man left the office, Dr. Diaz attempted to learn his origin, but other than saying that our solar system has twelve planets, the alien merely stated cryptically: The only thing I can tell you is that I come from beyond the sun. . . .  At the conclusion of this conversation, held in Spanish, the stranger left the office. Dr. Diaz attempted to follow, but by the time he reached the corner of the block, the man had vanished. At first, Dr. Diaz related this experience only to a few close friends and relatives, but subsequendy he was introduced to the UFO Education Center in California, where he learned that others had claimed to have had encounters with extraterrestrials. In the realization that he was not alone, he felt secure enough to make the story public- and even to make a special trip to New York, where he related the details to a United Nations delegation. There will be those who will arbitrarily reject this sensational account without further consideration. Others will cast aspersions on the doctor's state of mental health or integrity, accusing him of fabricating the story for self-aggrandizement. But it is hardly likely that a highly respected doctor, who up to that time had been in practice for over twenty-five years, would risk his professional reputation with such a story unless it had actually taken place. When I spoke with Dr. Diaz by phone in 1980, he struck me as being completely truthful, and gave me the names of some of the United Nations delegates with whom he had spoken in New York. The meeting had taken place in the office of Robert Muller, under secretary of economic and social development, and accordingly, I telephoned him at the United Nations. Mr. Muller confirmed the meeting with Dr. Diaz, but when I asked what the United Nations proposed to do about it, he replied: Nothing -nothing at all. I circulated it to some people who might be able to do something about it and I had not a single response. A GERMAN CONNECTION  We find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto assumed, and whose base of operations is at present unknown to us, Dr. Wernher von Braun is alleged to have stated in 1959, in reference to the deflection from orbit of a United States satellite. More I cannot say at present. We are now engaged in entering into closer contact with those powers, and in six or nine months' time it may be possible to speak with more precision on the matter. Whether Von Braun had aliens in mind may never be known, but in view of information I have acquired over the years from reliable sources, indicating that contact has been established with a number of scientists, the possibility cannot be discounted. A colleague of mine, for example, learned from a scientist friend in the 1970s that the director of a German/American space research center (located in West Germany) was of allegedly extraterrestrial origin. This knowledge was restricted to a quorum of scientists at the base, and the information apparently supplied by the director proved to be invaluable in their research effort. Just another wild, unsubstantiated story? Perhaps. But I have to add that my colleague had the opportunity of meeting the director in London in the 1980s (together with his scientist friend) and is satisfied as to the director's credentials. Even Germany's great space pioneer Dr. Hermann Oberth is reported to have endorsed the suggestion of alien liaison. We cannot take the credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fields alone; we have been helped, he is quoted as having said. When asked by whom, he simply replied, The people of other worlds.27 To my great regret, I neglected to ask Oberth about this when I met him in 1972, but I recall that he did not reject the possibility that aliens might have established bases here on Earth. DANGEROUS LIAISONS  But alien contact is infinitely more complex than the scenario suggested here. Having spent over thirty years interviewing many witnesses throughout the world, it is evident to me that we are confronted with a diversity of UFO occupants, and I see no valid reason for discarding one type of report on the basis of its failure to fit in with our preconceived notions of alien appearance and behavior."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_target": "We speak of things now in service to the Revelation that is being given to the world, and its teaching about life in the universe in particular. For you must have testimony from the universe itself, and not from one race or individual alone, but from a greater Network representing countless races that function beyond the reach of governments and commerce; beyond the reach of ambitious individuals and groups and nations; beyond all of the corruption and manipulation that exist in this region of space, which is considerable and complicated and dangerous. We bring to you the reality of life in the universe as we see it and have known it. It is not simply our understanding, however, that we present to you here. It is the wisdom of the Networks of the Wise, who share their wisdom with one another through the Higher Powers. In this way, Heaven has its agents on the ground-here, there, everywhere, hidden, small groups and sometimes isolated individuals, but very well connected so that the wisdom that we provide can not only represent our individual experience or understanding, but the wisdom of the Wise throughout this part of the universe. There is no race that could understand the meaning of life fully in this universe, or understand fully that all beings living in the physical reality are living in a state of Separation from the Divine. The Revelation for your world now, and the Messenger sent for this purpose, can explain these things to you, for you need a human representative to do this for you. He too is part of the Greater Coordination, as is his family. They have been sent here as the seeds of the Greater Coordination in the world, not only to meet the great challenge of Intervention and the great challenges that humanity is facing, but also to accompany humanity's emergence into the Greater Community and to build this sacred bond here. For if humanity is to ever attain real freedom in the universe, or be able to maintain this freedom and to attain stability in this world with your environment, you will need this Greater Coordination here to maintain a higher level of Knowledge and, if possible, even to advise your future leaders. For in a free nation, what leader would not want to have access to such great wisdom without being part of the Network itself? For those in political power are rarely involved in the great Networks because they are too heavily controlled and influenced by their governments. Therefore, do not think that the notable people in your world are part of this greater Network. They are not free. They are not able to function at this level. But those who are part of these Networks can advise them into the future. And such advice in a free nation would be critically important because now you have access to wisdom from the whole universe, not just from local regions, not just from individual perceptions, not just from one nation's own history and limited awareness.",
        "text_source": "You'd know where all the treasures on Earth are buried. Bodies, too, most likely. What sort of being would you have to be to have such God-like powers? A being from the fifth dimension, just one level up from where we now perceive ourselves to be. Although the rest of us here in our 3-D world (plus space-time) would regard your powers as magical, you'd realize that it's just having a more advantageous perspective that makes such a difference. Some extraterrestrials somewhere may already know how to manipulate spacetime, although it's far in advance of anything we on Earth know how to do. But in the realm of hyperspace, all of these things are theoretically possible. Might these dimensions that scientists say are there but cannot be seen represent the scenery behind which our alien visitors come and go? Some physicists speculate that these extra dimensions might indeed account for paranormal phenomena. In this way, they could have a relevance to UFOs. One reason that UFOs seem to appear and disappear in and out of thin air (among the other possibilities explored earlier in this book) might be that they enter and exit our 3-D space by moving in another spatial dimension. Michael Murphy, in The Future of the Body, states that these hyperdimensional models of the universe have a resonance with esoteric accounts of extraspatial worlds in which our familiar existence is embedded, and from which phantom figures, luminosities, odors of sanctity, and other extrasomic phenomena materialize, and through which highly developed spirit-bodies move. Might our present movement abilities be analogous to those of early amphibians that had not learned to breathe or move freely on land? Many Worlds As early as 1957, the possibility was raised by physicists that during the evolution of the universe, it repeatedly split in half, each split like a fork in the road. If this is correct, the number of universes we might have to take into account are literally infinite. And each universe would be linked to every other at the points of the forks in the road. The many worlds theory allows that all possible quantum worlds exist. For example, in some worlds, humans exist as the dominant life-form on Earth. In other worlds, chemical reactions took place that prevented human life from evolving, and on this same planet another very different lifeform is the reigning species. Parallel Universes Physicist Stephen Hawking's theory of parallel universes takes the many worlds theory a bit further: He believes that there are an infinite number of self-contained universes and that wormholes offer the possibility of tunneling between them. But it's not likely that you'll soon be able to open a door and step into another, parallel universe where your boss never heard of you and your family doesn't know who you are. The connecting wormholes, which are now quite respectable topics of study for science, are thought to be extremely small, about the size of a Planck length-close to a one hundred billion times smaller than a proton. People who hate cramped travel situations might want to opt out of a trip to the neighboring universe until the technical details get worked out and a little more legroom is possible. 24 Multiple worlds are not thought to interact on a regular basis. Certain events, however, may cause tubes or wormholes to open up between them. Communication and travel between universes would then be possible. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) 25 Many physicists currently use quantum theory and experiments to describe the whole of reality as a multiverse that contains vast numbers of parallel or multiple universes. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) Wormholes through space could also be prime candidates for explaining how UFOs travel from one universe or solar system to another. Having mastered the difficulties of hyperspace, the UFO occupants (or their higher-intelligence leaders) would use these multiple tunnels constructed by nature to take a shortcut between their world and ours. The old argument You can't get here from there would no longer be valid. Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

        "text_target": "At the outset, they will treat you with deference, those of you who may encounter them face to face, but they will give you no power. They will not give you a choice. They will only try to convince you of the wisdom of their ways and the necessity of their presence in the world. And should you decline or should you resist, they will make life difficult for you, or they will discard you for later use. Some of those, we understand, who have not returned to the world were those who fought against them and were eliminated as a result. How do we know these things? We know them because we understand the Collectives. We understand their legal commerce, and we understand their illegal commerce. They want to use every part of the world. And they want to use every part of you. Just like you would want to use every part of the cow or the sheep or any other domesticated animal that you breed for your own purposes. How do we know that they are doing these things in the world? We know because we are monitoring their communications. Otherwise, we could not fully observe their activities and understand the nature of their involvement here. It is remarkably similar to their involvement in other emerging worlds. What we cannot see, the Unseen Ones have revealed to us. We know from their transmissions, their communications with their bases within the world and their satellites beyond the world, that many of their specimens, as they refer to you, have either perished or had to be used for other reasons. However, we know from their earth transmissions that many people are disappearing. So it is not difficult for us to see the connection. In their attempt to breed a new leadership for humanity, a hybridized person, they need all of these biological resources that we are describing. What we are speaking of here is the most hidden and secret part of their agenda, the part that they will never reveal to you willingly, the part that you may never see without great assistance. This is the most secret of their activities. They sell biological products on what you would call a black market in the universe. But the value of these products and the demand for them is indeed significant. In most places where commerce has been established, such as in your vicinity, such trade is illegal, for it is considered to be morally and ethically reprehensible. But with so many technological societies existing in the universe and biological resources such as exist in your world being as rare as they are, the demand for these fundamental elements is considerable. Many technologically advancing nations have outstripped their own world's biological resources to the extent that they must find them elsewhere, and they must trade and barter for them as one of their primary endeavors. This is not simply food products, minerals and metals and elements such as this. It is also the need for biological products such as we have described, which are abundant in your world and which are abundant within the human family. So when someone asks, What do they want? The appropriate answer is, They want your world and its resources. And they want you and your resources. As we have said, this is the most hidden of their agendas. But it is necessary for you to know because this makes the violation complete. The visitors do not hate humanity. They are not cruel and murderous in the sense that you might think. They just view you as a resource the way you view your animals as a resource. To them, though you have intelligence, they consider that you are irredeemably chaotic and unruly, and they do not understand your deeper motivations. They see your technology as being in a rather adolescent phase, and they look at your destructive behaviors with concern, anxiety and repulsion. Being without Knowledge, the spiritual foundation, they do not see that what they are perpetrating upon your world is ethically or morally reprehensible. It is merely an opportunity to fulfill their practical necessities  As we have said, they seek to bring humanity into their Collective, but this is only a very select part of your population. And here you would not be at the upper levels of their hierarchy. For all the other people in the world, what will happen to them if the Intervention is complete, if the occupation can be established completely? We have been reluctant to tell you certain things because we do not want to lose your attention. We do not want you to turn away in denial, thinking that you cannot face these matters. So we have tried to be extremely careful in the way that we have presented the situation. But in spite of this, there are certain things you must know and that you cannot readily see from your vantage point. We had to learn about these realities ourselves though we had assistance such as we are providing for you. But the reprehensible nature of the Collectives and their lack of morality and ethics is something we have had to face. That is why we avoid the Collectives in our own worlds, where they cannot penetrate. There are many nations in the universe that have created alliances to protect themselves from Collectives such as these, particularly in well-inhabited areas of the galaxy. This is why many of the Collectives' activities are governed by trade unions and regional governing powers and authorities. They are held in check by many other forces who do not want to fall under their persuasion or their control. Even many of their trading partners look at them with anxiety. And even if they are forced to engage in commerce with Collectives, they must protect themselves from the Collectives' influence. Resources are precious in the universe-mineral resources, water resources, biological resources, food resources. Large technological societies such as the Collectives have an enormous need for resources for their own maintenance. Their commerce is based upon the acquisition of all these things and on the exploration for new sources. This, of course, makes them primarily interested in emerging worlds such as your own, which are emerging within regions where they have influence and power. Consider our words. Now we will tell you what you must do.",
        "text_source": "In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

        "text_target": "We cannot answer these questions. Only you can answer them. We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves. No one in the world is prepared to give you this counsel, for how could anyone know? It takes your allies, the Allies of Humanity, to provide this perspective and this orientation. Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings.",
        "text_source": "There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "The Allies Briefings were given to the author over a span of 19 years. They offer perspective and vision into a complex subject which, despite decades of mounting evidence, continues to baffle researchers. Yet this perspective is not romantic, speculative or idealistic in its approach to this subject. To the contrary, it is bluntly realistic and uncompromising to the point where it may be quite challenging, even to a reader who is well versed in this subject. Therefore, to receive what these Briefings have to offer requires that you suspend, for a moment at least, many of the beliefs, assumptions and questions that you may have about extraterrestrial Contact and even about how these Briefings were received. The contents of these Briefings are like a message in a bottle sent here from beyond the world. Thus, we should not be so concerned about the bottle but about the message itself. To truly understand this challenging message, we must confront and question many of the prevailing assumptions and tendencies regarding the possibility and the reality of Contact. These include:  denial; hopeful expectation; misinterpreting the evidence to affirm our beliefs; wanting and expecting salvation from the visitors; believing that ET technology will save us; feeling hopeless and submissive to what we assume is a superior force; demanding government disclosure but not ET disclosure; condemning human leaders and institutions while maintaining unquestioned acceptance of the visitors; assuming that because they have not attacked or invaded us, they must be here for our good; assuming that advanced technology equals advanced ethics and spirituality; believing that this phenomenon is a mystery when in fact it is a comprehensible event; believing that ETs in some way have claim to humanity and to this planet; and believing that humanity is irredeemable and cannot make it on its own. The Allies Briefings challenge such assumptions and tendencies and explode many of the myths we currently have about who is visiting us and why they are here. The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions.",
        "text_source": "Moreover, the track record of channelers fails to inspire confidence. Believing the claims of all of their contradictory and often mutually exclusive predictions would leave one extremely confused, to say the least. The memory of the failed 2012 Ascension predictions by many channelers and psychics also left a bad taste. Finally, insights or wisdom provided by a channeler is one thing; concluding therefore that they must be accurate when claiming it comes from an extraterrestrial being is quite another. New Age Aliens   Channeling extraterrestrials goes right to the beginning of the modern UFO phenomenon. As early as 1952, a contactee named George Van Tassell claimed to be in telepathic communication with extraterrestrials. He made no paranormal claims, but stated that they used advanced technology to connect with natural human abilities. The name of the being who contacted him, he said, was named Ashtar. Ashtar's earliest messages focused on the dangers from nuclear weapons. They also described an extraterrestrial government that monitored Earth and wanted to improve life for humanity. This was the origin of the idea of Ashtar Command  Soon, Ashtar Command was being channeled by others. The messages did not always agree, and rivalries developed. Many predictions followed, often centering on the imminent arrival of an Ashtar-led armada to guide and protect mankind. During the 1970s, a person known as Tuella began channeling Ashtar Command. Rather than emphasize technology or politics, she focused on inner spiritual development and achieving higher dimensions. This, of course, coincided with the beginnings of the modern New Age movement. Other Ashtar channelers continued to emphasize apocalyptic themes, even stating that Ashtar Command's ships would soon arrive to help people evacuate the planet. One such channeler predicted this would happen in 1994. The Internet gave Ashtar Command a new life. It appears that no matter how many failed predictions exist in one's track record, there are always people who will find a way to believe the next one. Today, after more than half a century of existence, Ashtar Command (now known as Ashtar Galactic Command) seems to work as a kind of committee that keeps control over its messages. Apocalypses are definitely out. But Ashtar Command is just one small part of the modern channeling of alleged extraterrestrials, which exploded into ufology during the 1980s. Barbara Marciniak, for example, began channeling the Pleiadians at that time and gained an influence that is difficult to overstate. [325] Her sessions provided a virtually complete statement of modern New Age philosophy. She was not the first channeler to give such messages, but she was the first popular channeler who explicitly communicated with extraterrestrials and incorporated such a philosophy. Earlier channelers, such as J. Z. Knight, the channeler of Ramtha, essentially offered the same ideas, but Ramtha is Lemurian, not extraterrestrial. And what is that message? In the case of the Pleiadians, they speak to Marciniak from the future. They claim to be one of many extraterrestrial life forms interacting with Earth, not all of which are benevolent. They claim that Earth will experience a major event, beginning in 2012, during which the battle for dominion of our world will take place. Indeed, the original prediction was not for 2012. When it was in made in the early 1990s, it was set for the year 2000. Now that the 2012 prediction seems to have failed, too, perhaps a new date will be set. Or, perhaps it has happened on schedule, since most of us cannot perceive this battle, which is said to occur in the fourth and fifth dimensions, and most of humanity perceives only three dimensions. According to Marciniak's sources, this is because 300,000 years ago, in an earlier struggle for Earth, human DNA was disassembled by malevolent beings from twelve strands to a double helix structure. These beings wanted to keep humanity ignorant so as to feed from our fear, anger, and doubt. The fundamental message is that Reptilians are really in charge of this planet and keep humanity for their own sustenance. In this context, the Pleiadian message via Marciniak is to remind humanity of its divine origins, to trigger its DNA reconstruction, to help people re-assimilate light into their bodies, and raise their frequency. All of this will enable them to travel in higher dimensions and survive the coming upheaval. This is the core of what has been called the Ascension process. It has also become the foundation of the New Age belief system insofar as it is connected to UFO studies. But it is more likely the message, and not the cosmology, that has attracted most adherents. The message, in essentials, is one that has been channeled for a long time, including in the Seth books by Jane Roberts, and even before: that each person creates his or her own reality by their thoughts and intentions. You create your reality by your thoughts. Some people take this notion further than others. Ramtha, for instance, says literally that you are God, and that consciousness and energy create the nature of reality. This is a philosophy that has a great attraction to many people, although most of us might draw the line at the presumption (and narcissism) of calling ourselves God. Just as questionable is the idea that one literally creates one's own reality. The contention is that there is no actual reality separate from one's thoughts. Everyone can agree that our thoughts are critical in the success or failure of our life's endeavors, and many even acknowledge that one's thoughts can affect the body's health and healing processes. Yet, this is different from stating that thoughts literally create reality. Taken to an extreme, it would mean that if you don't think it, it's not happening. Particularly if you are convinced you are God. There are more obviously attractive features to the philosophy, particularly when it coincides with the existentialist idea that there are no excuses in life. Most of us can appreciate that each of us is ultimately responsible for creating our world. Ditto a spirituality that emphasizes having the proper intention in all matters, and promoting Christ consciousness. But that is another topic altogether, and beyond the scope of this book. Our question is not whether or not someone likes the philosophy. Rather, we want to know how likely it is that extraterrestrial beings actually are being channeled? My personal conclusion is, not very. The statements that come to us purporting to be scientific have not found corroboration, or have been plainly disproven. And most of the statements, it has to be said, show little to no appreciation of science."

It is essential for researchers to remain aware of these developments and use them. Of course, we need the technology in order to communicate and learn from each other. The value of YouTube has already been discussed, but beyond this, we face a future of ubiquitous video conferencing and live streaming. Already, these technologies are both starting to make a difference in ufology. They need to be pushed further. Ultimately, however, no matter how far into the future ufology goes, it must continue to rely upon sound investigations and proper reporting of results that actually reach the public. Scientific ufology, but with modern leadership, political savvy, and a commitment to the people. Ufology: Getting Personal   One thing I have learned in my two decades of studying the UFO phenomenon is that it has the power to captivate someone's attention and become an obsession. I will never forget my first year of true attention and research into this field, and the many nights of lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to reconfigure my worldview in a way that made sense with the new facts I had learned. For myself, the feeling was more akin to an intense intellectual curiosity than anything else, a splinter in the mind (in the words of the character Morpheus from the movie, The Matrix). For some, however, the effect goes deeper still. I have seen personalities become nearly destabilized by the effect of having their once-stable worldview shaken or even shattered by the subject of UFOs. I don't know of a sure-fire method to prevent this from happening to certain people. We are all different. There are some people, who knows why, who seem to roll with this transformation more easily than others. In some cases, however, there are those who become convinced that they have had experiences of some sort with this phenomenon, including direct contact with these other intelligences. Such people may be correct or not, but there is no question that their new information affects them deeply. They become obsessed by this subject in a way that consumes their lives, sometimes in an unhealthy way. It is a difficult thing for any person to reinvent their basic understanding of the world, especially after they reach a mature age. No one wants to go through that process, because it is an implicit recognition that their many prior years were spent living in a kind of illusory world. Ironically, it is often those with a higher level of formal education who seem to have a hard time with this. After all, they have spent those years convinced that they were ahead of the game, that they were more knowledgeable than the average person about how the world works, and invested much of their self-esteem and identity into that understanding. But it can happen to anyone. All of this is made harder by the fact by their belief that most of their friends, family, and colleagues would either not believe them, or might even ridicule them. And so while they go through this difficult transformation, there are often very few people they can talk to about it. Added to this is another problem. Once someone decides that this is a subject worth their attention, they usually realize that there is an overabundance of information and literature. It can feel overwhelming, especially if one is starting not only with a limited knowledge of the subject, but often a relatively limited knowledge of science, history, philosophy, politics, psychology, or any number of other subjects that are certainly helpful in navigating one's way through this tangled field. But the challenge is harder still when we remember that most people have other responsibilities in their lives: family, jobs, social obligations and the rest. If they work long hours, as many do, they are tired when they come home and are probably not in the mood to do hours of research, day after day, to help recreate some semblance of an ordered reality, especially when that new reality is much less congenial and reassuring than what they had once known. Moreover, they probably don't want to fight the machine, they don't want to be heroes; they just want a good life."

        "text_target": "How perfect this is for the alien agenda. It takes time, but from their perspective, well, the results are worth it. The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from. In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it. This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family. There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted. And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth. Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated? Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God's punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God's will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done. Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people's sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged-not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power. How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn the Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it's coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust? The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference. People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, Jesus has come to me. And the Jesus says, You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others! And the zealous follower says, Yes, Master, yes, Master! Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention. Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people's religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know. It is humanity's ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity's Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new. This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people. This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction. As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies' message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people's inability to respond. It's like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don't know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, Well, it's just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them. This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all. Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing. Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it's not happening. There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth. Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone! Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, This is what it is! without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today. We encourage the development of people's discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about. We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world. Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it's facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.",
        "text_source": "There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "The visitors do not care how many of your people are destroyed so long as they have a primary allegiance amongst the majority. Therefore, the visitors will focus on those fundamental ideas that give them this authority and influence. A Second Coming, then, is being prepared by your visitors. The evidence of this, we understand, is already in the world. People do not realize the presence of the visitors or the nature of reality in the Greater Community, and so they will naturally accept their prior beliefs without question, feeling that the time has come for the great return of their Savior and their Teacher. But he who will come will not come from the Heavenly Host, he will not represent Knowledge or the Unseen Ones, and he will not represent the Creator or the Creator's will. We have seen this plan in formulation in the world. We have also seen similar plans carried out in other worlds. In other religious traditions, uniformity will be encouraged by the visitors-what you might call a fundamental kind of religion based upon the past, based upon allegiance to authority and based upon conformity to the institution. This serves the visitors. They are not interested in the ideology and values of your religious traditions, only in their usefulness. The more that people can think alike, act alike and respond in predictable ways, the more useful they are to the collectives. This conformity is being promoted in many different traditions. The intent here is not to make them all the same but to have them be simple within themselves. In one part of the world, one particular religious ideology will prevail; in a different part of the world, a different religious ideology will prevail. This is entirely useful to your visitors, for they do not care if there is more than one religion so long as there is order, conformity and allegiance. Having no religion of their own that you could possibly follow or identify with, they will use yours to engender their own values. For they value only total allegiance to their cause and to the collectives and seek your total allegiance to participate with them in ways that they prescribe. They will assure you that this will create peace and redemption in the world and the return of whatever religious image or personage is considered of the greatest value here. This is not to say that fundamental religion is governed by alien forces, for we understand that fundamental religion has been well established in your world. What we are saying here is that the impulses for this and the mechanisms for this will be supported by the visitors and used for their own purposes. Therefore, great care must be given by all who are true believers in their traditions to discern these influences and to counteract them if possible. Here it is not the average person in the world that the visitors seek to convince; it is the leadership.",
        "text_source": "In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_target": "______________________  We feel that it is important, given the information that we have provided thus far, to respond to questions that must surely arise regarding our reality and the significance of the messages that we have come to give. ~  Given the lack of hard evidence, why should people believe what you are telling them about the Intervention? First, there must be great evidence concerning the visitation to your world. We have been told that this is the case. Yet we have also been told by the Unseen Ones that people do not know how to understand the evidence and that they give it their own meaning-a meaning that they prefer to give it, a meaning that provides comfort and reassurance for the most part. We are certain that there is adequate evidence to verify that the Intervention is occurring in the world today if one takes the time to look and to investigate this matter. The fact that your governments or religious leaders do not reveal such things does not mean that such a great event is not occurring in your midst. ~  How can people know that you are real? Regarding our reality, we cannot demonstrate our physical presence to you, and so you must discern the meaning and the import of our words. At this point, it is not merely a matter of belief. It requires a greater recognition, a Knowledge, a resonance. The words we speak we believe are true, but that does not assure that they can be received as such. We cannot control the response to our message. There are people who require more evidence than can possibly be given. For others, such evidence will not be necessary, for they will feel an inner confirmation. In the meantime, perhaps we remain a controversy, and yet we hope and we trust that our words can be considered seriously and that the evidence that does exist, which is substantial, can be gathered and understood by those who are willing to give this their effort and their focus in life. From our perspective, there is no greater problem, challenge and opportunity to receive your attention. Therefore, you are at the beginning of a new understanding. This does require faith and self-reliance. Many will reject our words simply because they do not believe that we could possibly exist. Others perhaps will think that we are part of some manipulation that is being cast upon the world. We cannot control these responses. We can only reveal our message and our presence in your life, however removed that presence may be. It is not our presence here that is of paramount importance, but the message that we have come to reveal and the greater perspective and understanding that we can provide for you. Your education must begin somewhere. All education begins with the desire to know. We hope that through our discourses we can gain at least part of your confidence in order to begin to reveal what we are here to offer. ~  What do you have to say to those who view the Intervention as a positive thing? We understand, first of all, the expectation that all forces from the heavens are related to your spiritual understanding, traditions and fundamental beliefs. The idea that there is prosaic life in the universe is a challenge to these fundamental assumptions. From our perspective and given the experience of our own cultures, we understand these expectations. In the distant past, we maintained them ourselves. And yet we had to relinquish them in facing the realities of Greater Community life and the meaning of visitation. You live in a great physical universe. It is full of life. This life represents countless manifestations and also represents the evolution of intelligence and spiritual awareness at every level. What this means is that what you will encounter in the Greater Community encompasses almost every possibility. However, you are isolated and do not yet travel in space. And even if you had the capability to reach another world, the universe is vast, and no one has gained the ability to go from one end of the galaxy to the other with any kind of speed. Therefore, the physical universe remains enormous and incomprehensible. No one has mastered its laws. No one has conquered its territories. No one can claim complete dominance or control. Life has a great humbling effect in this way. Even far beyond your borders this is true. You should then come to expect that you will meet intelligences representing forces for good, forces for ignorance and those who are more neutral regarding you. However, in the realities of Greater Community travel and exploration, emerging races such as your own will, almost without exception, encounter resource explorers, collectives and those seeking advantage for themselves as their first contact with Greater Community life. Regarding the positive interpretation of visitation, part of this is human expectation and the natural desire to welcome a good outcome and to seek help from the Greater Community for the problems that humanity has not been able to resolve on its own. It is normal to expect such things, particularly when you are considering that your visitors have greater capabilities than do you. However, a large part of the problem in interpreting the great visitation has to do with the will and the agenda of the visitors themselves. For they are encouraging people everywhere to view their presence here as wholly beneficial to humanity and to its needs.",
        "text_source": "CULTURE SHOCK  Our own galaxy-one of an infinite number-is comprised of several hundred billion stars, and statistically, it is probable that life has evolved on some planetary systems to the extent that space travel and colonization are commonplace. In assuming that the lifetime of advanced civilizations is ten million years, science writer Ian Ridpath has speculated that there could be as many as one million advanced civilizations like ourselves or more advanced in our galaxy, and surmises that the main interest of an old and advanced civilization may be in the developing creatures of the Galaxy, as the anthropologists of the Western world are increasingly fascinated by the stone- age societies that remain on Earth.23 Dr. Bernard Oliver, of NASA's SETI project, has remarked on the possibility that an interconnecting galactic community of advanced cultures already exists. Although some astronomers and exobiologists concur that we may have been visited in the distant past, and are certain to be visited in the future, present-day visits are out of the question. The logic of such reasoning escapes me. The fact that contact has been restricted to relatively few people so far, rather than being on a wide scale, may be for a number of sound reasons-not least of which the cultural shock that would be engendered. For us this could hold more danger than the combination of nuclear arms, energy shortages, overpopulation, dwindling resources and pollution, believes Edward Ashpole, author of The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Some visitors may not want us to know what they are doing here, and in any event, can probably go about their business with none of us any the wiser (particularly if they are able to function in another dimension!). It is therefore likely that those who have been contacted are fed a certain amount of false information. Disinformation could well be an inevitable consequence of contact. Others may be so advanced, technologically, culturally, and spiritually , that contact with our relatively retarded species might be seen as disadvantageous to both parties. In this regard, the comments made by Daniel Fry's alleged extraterrestrial friend in 1949 are worth recounting. We will never attempt to thrust either our knowledge or our culture upon your people, he said, and we will never offer it unless there is substantial evidence that they desire it, and that it would be advantageous to them. There is certainly no such evidence at the present time. It is also true that the purpose of this visit is not entirely philanthropic, since there are some materials upon your planet which we could use to the advantage of both our peoples; materials which you have in abundance but which are rather scarce elsewhere in this solar system. While the use of some of these materials would be of assistance to us, our services to your people will not be made contingent upon such use. Any knowledge or aid which we can give will be freely offered. . . . If we took steps to force the acceptance of our reality upon their consciousness, Fry was told, about 30 percent of the people would consider us as gods, and could attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their welfare. This is a responsibility we could not be permitted to assume, even if we were able to discharge it, which of course, we are not. Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe. National security policy-makers might argue for classification of the contact and the information received. Some scholars, particularly those personally involved in the first contact, might be equally possessive about the information and the channel, especially if they distrusted governments and held a low opinion of the general population. As Bob Lazar stresses, although advanced alien technology could be put to use for the benefit of all, the same technology could equally well be used for destructive purposes, such as the construction of a superbomb. Michael Michaud foresees another problem relating to the acquisition of alien technology: that it could undermine our spirit of invention and independent initiative, forcing massive readjustment and unemployment, and threatening existing economic institutions. I take the view that those few within governments who are aware of the situation are acting in our best interests by gradually presenting the information in such a way that it will lessen the political, economic, religious, and psychological shock. But eventually, the ultimate secret will be revealed. The truth about UFOs may be painful for us to face, and this might provide a continuing rationale for the government to maintain secrecy, says the astrophysicist Dr. Brian O'Leary. But the truth will and must be known eventually. Continuing our denials and fears, in my opinion, [is] only adding to the problem. We are all in this together. The evidence available to me suggests that we are being visited by a number of extraterrestrial groups.31 Some could be here for less than benign purposes, others perhaps visiting as anthropologists or even tourists. But it seems logical that some groups, motivated by a vested interest in the survival of our planet and its species, have established contact with a relatively small number of our people, partly perhaps to lend us a helping hand as we reach, falteringly, toward the stars. Let us hope that the advantages of contact will ultimately outweigh the disadvantages, leading to a more complete and profound understanding of our place in the universal scheme."

        "text_target": "The Allies Briefings were given to the author over a span of 19 years. They offer perspective and vision into a complex subject which, despite decades of mounting evidence, continues to baffle researchers. Yet this perspective is not romantic, speculative or idealistic in its approach to this subject. To the contrary, it is bluntly realistic and uncompromising to the point where it may be quite challenging, even to a reader who is well versed in this subject. Therefore, to receive what these Briefings have to offer requires that you suspend, for a moment at least, many of the beliefs, assumptions and questions that you may have about extraterrestrial Contact and even about how these Briefings were received. The contents of these Briefings are like a message in a bottle sent here from beyond the world. Thus, we should not be so concerned about the bottle but about the message itself. To truly understand this challenging message, we must confront and question many of the prevailing assumptions and tendencies regarding the possibility and the reality of Contact. These include:  denial; hopeful expectation; misinterpreting the evidence to affirm our beliefs; wanting and expecting salvation from the visitors; believing that ET technology will save us; feeling hopeless and submissive to what we assume is a superior force; demanding government disclosure but not ET disclosure; condemning human leaders and institutions while maintaining unquestioned acceptance of the visitors; assuming that because they have not attacked or invaded us, they must be here for our good; assuming that advanced technology equals advanced ethics and spirituality; believing that this phenomenon is a mystery when in fact it is a comprehensible event; believing that ETs in some way have claim to humanity and to this planet; and believing that humanity is irredeemable and cannot make it on its own. The Allies Briefings challenge such assumptions and tendencies and explode many of the myths we currently have about who is visiting us and why they are here. The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions.",
        "text_source": "You'd know where all the treasures on Earth are buried. Bodies, too, most likely. What sort of being would you have to be to have such God-like powers? A being from the fifth dimension, just one level up from where we now perceive ourselves to be. Although the rest of us here in our 3-D world (plus space-time) would regard your powers as magical, you'd realize that it's just having a more advantageous perspective that makes such a difference. Some extraterrestrials somewhere may already know how to manipulate spacetime, although it's far in advance of anything we on Earth know how to do. But in the realm of hyperspace, all of these things are theoretically possible. Might these dimensions that scientists say are there but cannot be seen represent the scenery behind which our alien visitors come and go? Some physicists speculate that these extra dimensions might indeed account for paranormal phenomena. In this way, they could have a relevance to UFOs. One reason that UFOs seem to appear and disappear in and out of thin air (among the other possibilities explored earlier in this book) might be that they enter and exit our 3-D space by moving in another spatial dimension. Michael Murphy, in The Future of the Body, states that these hyperdimensional models of the universe have a resonance with esoteric accounts of extraspatial worlds in which our familiar existence is embedded, and from which phantom figures, luminosities, odors of sanctity, and other extrasomic phenomena materialize, and through which highly developed spirit-bodies move. Might our present movement abilities be analogous to those of early amphibians that had not learned to breathe or move freely on land? Many Worlds As early as 1957, the possibility was raised by physicists that during the evolution of the universe, it repeatedly split in half, each split like a fork in the road. If this is correct, the number of universes we might have to take into account are literally infinite. And each universe would be linked to every other at the points of the forks in the road. The many worlds theory allows that all possible quantum worlds exist. For example, in some worlds, humans exist as the dominant life-form on Earth. In other worlds, chemical reactions took place that prevented human life from evolving, and on this same planet another very different lifeform is the reigning species. Parallel Universes Physicist Stephen Hawking's theory of parallel universes takes the many worlds theory a bit further: He believes that there are an infinite number of self-contained universes and that wormholes offer the possibility of tunneling between them. But it's not likely that you'll soon be able to open a door and step into another, parallel universe where your boss never heard of you and your family doesn't know who you are. The connecting wormholes, which are now quite respectable topics of study for science, are thought to be extremely small, about the size of a Planck length-close to a one hundred billion times smaller than a proton. People who hate cramped travel situations might want to opt out of a trip to the neighboring universe until the technical details get worked out and a little more legroom is possible. 24 Multiple worlds are not thought to interact on a regular basis. Certain events, however, may cause tubes or wormholes to open up between them. Communication and travel between universes would then be possible. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) 25 Many physicists currently use quantum theory and experiments to describe the whole of reality as a multiverse that contains vast numbers of parallel or multiple universes. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) Wormholes through space could also be prime candidates for explaining how UFOs travel from one universe or solar system to another. Having mastered the difficulties of hyperspace, the UFO occupants (or their higher-intelligence leaders) would use these multiple tunnels constructed by nature to take a shortcut between their world and ours. The old argument You can't get here from there would no longer be valid. Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

        "text_target": "The first area of activity of the visitors is to influence individuals in positions of power and authority. Because the visitors do not want to destroy anything in the world or harm the world's resources, they seek to gain influence over those whom they perceive to be in positions of power, within government and religion primarily. They seek contact, but only with certain individuals. They have the power to make this contact, and they have the power of persuasion. Not all whom they contact will be persuaded, but many will be. The promise of greater power, greater technology and world domination will intrigue and incite many individuals. And it is these individuals with whom the visitors will seek to establish a liaison. There are very few people in the governments of the world who are being so affected, but their numbers are growing. The visitors understand the hierarchy of power because they themselves live by it, following their own chain of command, you might say. They are highly organized and very focused in their endeavors, and the idea of having cultures full of free-thinking individuals is largely foreign to them. They do not comprehend or understand individual freedom. They are like many technologically advanced societies in the Greater Community who function both within their respective worlds and in their establishments across vast reaches of space, utilizing a very well-established and rigid form of government and organization. They believe that humanity is chaotic and unruly, and they feel they are bringing order to a situation that they cannot themselves comprehend. Individual freedom is unknown to them, and they do not see its value. As a result, what they seek to establish in the world will not honor this freedom. Therefore, their first area of endeavor is to establish a liaison with individuals in positions of power and influence in order to gain their allegiance and to persuade them of the beneficial aspects of relationship and shared purpose. The second avenue of activity, which is perhaps the most difficult to consider from your perspective, is the manipulation of religious values and impulses. The visitors understand that humanity's greatest abilities also represent its greatest vulnerability. People's longing for individual redemption represents one of the greatest assets the human family has to offer, even to the Greater Community. But it is also your weakness. And it is these impulses and these values that will be used. Several groups of the visitors wish to establish themselves as spiritual agents because they know how to speak in the mental environment. They can communicate to people directly, and unfortunately, because there are very few people in the world who can discern the difference between a spiritual voice and the visitors' voice, the situation becomes very difficult. Therefore, the second area of activity is to gain people's allegiance through their religious and spiritual motivations. Actually, this can be done quite easily because humanity is not yet strong or developed in the mental environment. It is difficult for people to discern where these impulses are coming from. Many people want to give themselves to anything they think has a greater voice and a greater power. Your visitors can project images-images of your saints, of your teachers, of angels-images that are held dear and sacred within your world. They have cultivated this ability through many, many centuries of attempting to influence each other and by learning the ways of persuasion that are practiced in many places in the Greater Community. They consider you primitive, and so they feel they can exert this influence and use these methods upon you. Here there is an attempt to contact those individuals who are considered sensitive, receptive and naturally given to be cooperative. Many people will be selected, but a few will be chosen based upon these particular qualities. Your visitors will seek to gain allegiance with these individuals, to gain their trust and to gain their devotion, telling the recipients that the visitors are here to uplift humanity spiritually, to give humanity new hope, new blessings and new power-indeed promising the things that people want so dearly but have not yet found themselves. Perhaps you may wonder, How can such a thing occur? But we can assure you that it is not difficult once you learn these skills and abilities. The effort here is to pacify and to reeducate people through spiritual persuasion. This Pacification Program is used differently with different religious groups depending upon their ideals and their temperament. It is always aimed at receptive individuals. Here it is hoped that people will lose their sense of discernment and will become wholly trusting of the greater power that they feel is being given to them by the visitors. Once this allegiance is established, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to discern what they know within themselves from what is being told to them. It is a very subtle but very pervasive form of persuasion and manipulation. We shall speak more on this as we proceed. Let us now mention the third area of activity, which is to establish the visitors' presence in the world and to have people become used to this presence. They want humanity to become acclimated to this very great change that is occurring in your midst-to have you become acclimated to the visitors' physical presence and to their effect on your own mental environment. To serve this purpose, they will create establishments here, though not in view. These establishments will be hidden, but they will be very powerful in casting an influence on human populations that are near them. The visitors will take great care and time to make sure that these establishments are effective and that enough people are in allegiance to them. It is these people who will guard and preserve the visitors' presence. This is exactly what is occurring in your world at this time. It represents a great challenge and unfortunately a great risk. This very same thing that we are describing has happened so many times in so many places in the Greater Community. And emerging races such as your own are always the most vulnerable. Some emerging races are able to establish their own awareness, ability and cooperation to the extent that they can offset outside influences such as these and establish a presence and a position in the Greater Community. Yet many races, before they even attain this freedom, fall under the control and influence of foreign powers. We understand that this information may incite considerable fear and perhaps denial or confusion. But as we observe events, we realize that there are very few people who are aware of the situation as it actually exists. Even those people who are becoming aware of the presence of alien forces are not in a position and do not have the vantage point from which they can see the situation clearly. And being ever hopeful and optimistic, they seek to give this great phenomenon as much positive meaning as they can. However, the Greater Community is a competitive environment, a difficult environment. Those who engage in space travel do not necessarily represent the spiritually advanced, for those who are spiritually advanced seek insulation from the Greater Community. They do not seek commerce. They do not seek to influence other races or to engage in the very complex array of relationships that are established for mutual trade and benefit. Instead, the spiritually advanced seek to remain hidden. This is a very different understanding, perhaps, but a necessary one for you to come to comprehend the great predicament that humanity is facing. Yet this predicament holds great possibilities. We would like to speak about these now. Despite the gravity of the situation that we are describing, we do not feel that these circumstances are a tragedy for humanity. Indeed, if these circumstances can be recognized and understood, and if the preparation for the Greater Community, which now exists in the world, can be utilized, studied and applied, then people everywhere of good conscience will have the ability to learn Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom. Thus, people everywhere will be able to find the basis for cooperation so that the human family can finally establish a unity that has never been established here before. For it will take the overshadowing of the Greater Community to unite humanity. And this overshadowing is occurring now. It is your evolution to emerge into a Greater Community of intelligent life. It will happen whether you are prepared or not. It must occur. Preparation, then, becomes the key. Understanding and clarity-these are the things that are necessary and needed in your world at this time. People everywhere have great spiritual gifts that can enable them to see and to know clearly. These gifts are needed now. They need to be recognized, employed and shared freely. It is not merely up to a great teacher or a great saint in your world to do this. It must be cultivated by many more people now. For the situation brings with it necessity, and if necessity can be embraced, it brings with it great opportunity. However, the requirements to learn about the Greater Community and to begin to experience Greater Community Spirituality are tremendous. Never before have human beings had to learn such things in such a short period of time. Indeed, such things have rarely been learned ever by anyone in your world before. But now the need has changed. The circumstances are different. Now there are new influences in your midst, influences that you can feel and that you can know. The visitors seek to disable people from having this vision and this Knowledge within themselves, for your visitors do not have it within themselves. They do not see its value. They do not understand its reality. In this, humanity as a whole is more advanced than they are. But this is only a potential, a potential which must now be cultivated. The alien presence in the world is growing. It is growing every day, every year. Many more people are falling under its persuasion, losing their ability to know, becoming confused and distracted, believing in things that can only weaken them and make them impotent in the face of those who would seek to use them for their own purposes. Humanity is an emerging race. It is vulnerable. It is facing a set of circumstances and influences now which it has never had to face before. You have only evolved to compete with each other. You have never had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. Yet it is this competition that will strengthen you and will call forth your greatest attributes if the situation can be clearly seen and understood. It is the role of the Unseen Ones to foster this strength. The Unseen Ones, whom you would rightly call angels, do not only speak to the human heart but to hearts everywhere who are able to listen and who have gained the freedom to listen. We come, then, with a difficult message, but a message of promise and hope. Perhaps it is not the message that people want to hear. It is certainly not the message that the visitors would promote. It is a message that can be shared from person to person, and it will be shared because it is natural to do so. Yet the visitors and those who have come under their persuasion will oppose such an awareness. They do not want to see an independent humanity. That is not their purpose. They do not even believe it is beneficial. Therefore, it is our sincere desire that these ideas be considered without trepidation, but with a serious mind and a deep concern that are well justified here. There are many people in the world today, we understand, who feel that a great change is coming for humanity. The Unseen Ones have told us these things. Many causes are attributed to this sense of change. And many outcomes are predicted. Yet unless you can begin to comprehend the reality that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life, you do not yet have the right context for understanding the destiny of humanity or the great change that is occurring in the world. From our perspective, people are born into their time to serve that time. This is a teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, a teaching of which we are students as well. It teaches freedom and the power of shared purpose. It grants authority to the individual and to the individual who can join with others-ideas which are rarely accepted or adopted in the Greater Community, for the Greater Community is not the heavenly state. It is a physical reality with the rigors of survival and all that that entails. All beings within this reality must contend with these needs and issues. And in this, your visitors are more like you than you realize. They are not incomprehensible. They would seek to be incomprehensible, but they can be understood. You have the power to do this, but you must see with clear eyes. You must see with a greater vision and know with a greater intelligence, which you have the possibility to cultivate within yourselves. It is necessary for us now to speak more regarding the second area of influence and persuasion because this has great importance, and it is our sincere desire that you will understand these things and consider them for yourself. The religions of the world hold the key to human dedication and human allegiance, more than governments, more than any other institution. This speaks well for humanity because religions such as these are often hard to find in the Greater Community. Your world is rich in this respect, but your strength is also where you are weak and vulnerable. Many people want to be divinely guided and appointed, to give over the reins of their own lives and to have a greater spiritual power direct them, counsel them and preserve them. This is a genuine desire, but within a Greater Community context, considerable wisdom must be cultivated in order for this desire to be fulfilled. It is very sad for us to see how people will give their authority away so easily-something they have never even fully had, they will give away willingly to those who are unknown to them. This message is destined to reach people who have a greater spiritual affinity. Therefore, it is necessary that we elaborate on this subject. We advocate a spirituality that is taught in the Greater Community, not the spirituality that is governed by nations, governments or political alliances, but a natural spirituality-the ability to know, to see and to act. And yet this is not emphasized by your visitors. They seek to have people believe that the visitors are their family, that the visitors are their home, that the visitors are their brothers and sisters, their mothers and fathers. Many people want to believe, and so they believe. People want to give over their personal authority, and so it is given over. People want to see friends and salvation in the visitors, and so this is what they are shown. It will take great sobriety and objectivity in order to see through these deceptions and these difficulties. It will be necessary for people to do this if humanity is to successfully emerge into the Greater Community and maintain its freedom and its self-determination in an environment of greater influences and greater forces. In this, your world could be overtaken without firing a shot, for violence is considered primitive and crude and is rarely employed in matters such as this. Perhaps you may ask, Does this mean that there is an invasion of our world? We must say that the answer to this is yes, an invasion of the most subtle kind. If you can entertain these thoughts and consider them seriously, you will be able to see these things for yourself. The evidence of this invasion is everywhere. You can see how human ability is offset by the desire for happiness, peace and security, how people's vision and ability to know are hampered by influences even within their own cultures. How much greater these influences will be within a Greater Community environment. This is the difficult message that we must present. This is the message that must be said, the truth that must be spoken, the truth that is vital and cannot wait. It is so necessary for people now to learn a greater Knowledge, a greater Wisdom and a greater Spirituality so that they may find their true abilities and be able to use them effectively.",
        "text_source": "There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "We cannot answer these questions. Only you can answer them. We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves. No one in the world is prepared to give you this counsel, for how could anyone know? It takes your allies, the Allies of Humanity, to provide this perspective and this orientation. Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings.",
        "text_source": "Though science has inadvertently become our ally, too many individual scientists remain mired in past attitudes. Indifference to an objective consideration of the mass of available UFO data is still the norm. It is our profound hope that Sight Unseen will alert open-minded members of the scientific community to the need to join in this crucially important investigation. Our second goal in writing this book is to provide enough specific information about the aliens' behavior on our planet to enable readers to form their own judgments about its intent and its future course. We have presented nearly a score of UFO abduction cases and provided many verbatim transcripts of the abductees' interviews, letters, and hypnotic sessions. As most of our readers are probably aware, the actual range of this firsthand testimony is far more consistent than the bewildering range of opinions theorists have issued about the meaning of it all. On one end of the scale is what we might call the ultraparanoid interpretation: that the aliens are demons, beings who have come here to capture and devour our children, to use human body parts as replacements, and to feast upon what General Buck Turgison in Dr. Strangelove called our vital bodily fluids. There is not, in our opinion, a scintilla of evidence supporting such a dire and melodramatic reading of the data. On the other end of the spectrum is the idea-hope is perhaps a better word-that the aliens are here as quasi-godlike beings to help us with our problems, to heal our damaged planet, and to offer what has been called, with a straight face, unconditional love. No one who reads the accounts we have been presenting can come to such a rosy- and simplistic-conclusion. The truth is, of course, that we do not know the future. We do not know the aliens' ultimate intentions, nor do we really know what their options are. As the reader may have discerned, Hopkins and Rainey have somewhat differing views about alien intent. We do not share the same balance between hope and pessimism. On the one hand, Rainey suggests: What the ETs may be creating are not hybrids at all but transgenic human beings. It is both biologically possible and would best fit the profile of a secretive, invasive force that might be intent on conquering us from within-or equally possible, healing or altering the genes that no longer work for us in our present environment. The change could happen one genetic code word at a time-or an entire chromosome at a time. Either way, if the genes to be modified were carefully and expertly selected over thousands of years, we might never notice what was happening. The Hollywood-style massive destruction and cultural devastation seen in the movie Independence Day would never have to be played out. Biologists tell us that an entire species can do most of its changing internally, with new species traits only gradually manifesting themselves in outward appearance and behavior. If this is indeed occurring, will these alterations be good for the humans-or bad for the humans? This is a difficult issue to take in both emotionally and intellectually: The subtle but inexorable alteration of the human species. But it may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own has already mastered the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the lifeforms on Earth from those of other planets-or even, perhaps, in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, and with only a handful of mainstream scientists willing or able to risk ridicule and loss of funding, people worldwide who are experiencing the UFO abduction phenomenon firsthand have little choice. They can only hope and pray that these alien beings know what they're doing. On the other hand, Hopkins cautions, in such a transaction the odds favor us losing and the aliens gaining. He states: The twenty-seven years I have spent working with abductees, listening to their traumatic encounters, and trying to help them heal a lifetime of psychic damage, have left me hardened to reassuring talk of beings of light practicing benevolent tough love. I have seen too much pain to allow myself more than a life-sustaining modicum of hope. And yet, I may be wrong. Though abductions inevitably leave the abductees scarred, emotionally and psychologically, there is no sign that this kind of psychic damage was intended. In fact, there are many indications that the UFO occupants try to minimize the pain and emotional damage their activities naturally inflict."

And yet there are more things that you must learn regarding this in order to gain the eyes to see and to understand these things for yourself. Though this may all seem strange and new to you, it is but another demonstration of nature, nature that you understand and comprehend within your own realm. Nearly everything we are about to impart to you and that we have imparted already can be understood from your experience of nature. That is why the extraterrestrial Intervention is not a mystery. It is a demonstration of nature. Its difficulty, however, is that it casts you in a different role than you are used to. For you are used to being pre-eminent in your own world. You are used to feeling that you have the great evolutionary advantage within your own realm. But within the Greater Community, you do not have this pre-eminence or this advantage. Therefore, you must gain greater skill and a greater cooperation amongst yourselves. This is both a great difficulty and a great opportunity for your race, for it is perhaps only the overshadowing of the Greater Community and the difficulties that it will confront you with that will enable humanity to unite and to find its common ground. Whether this can be accomplished remains to be seen. But the challenge is upon you and that challenge confronts the life and the future of every person living in the world today. At one moment, this may seem strange and incomprehensible, and yet in the next moment, you can understand that this is nature being carried out. You possess an environment and resources that are valued by others who seek to use and to have these things for themselves. It is your environment that they want. It is your help that they need. They do not seek to destroy you but to have you become part of their Collective in service to them.",
        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

        "text_target": "This is a very great time for humanity, but humanity is not prepared. From our vantage point, we can see this on a larger scale. We do not involve ourselves with the daily lives of individuals in the world. We do not attempt to persuade governments or to lay claim to certain parts of the world or to certain resources that exist here. Instead, we observe, and we wish to report what we observe, for this is our mission in being here. The Unseen Ones have told us that there are many people today who feel a strange discomfort, a sense of vague urgency, a feeling that something is going to happen and that something must be done. Perhaps there is nothing within their daily sphere of experience that justifies these deeper feelings, that verifies the importance of these feelings, or that gives substance to their expression. We can understand this because we have been through similar things ourselves in our own histories. We represent several races joined together in our small alliance to support the emergence of Knowledge and Wisdom in the universe, particularly with races that are on the threshold of emerging into the Greater Community. These emerging races are particularly vulnerable to foreign influence and manipulation. They are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding their situation and understandably so, for how could they comprehend the meaning and the complexity of life within the Greater Community? That is why we wish to play our small part in preparing and in educating humanity. In our first discourse, we gave a broad description of the visitors' involvement in four areas. The first area is the influence on important people in positions of power in governments and at the head of religious institutions. The second area of influence is on people who have a spiritual inclination and who wish to open themselves to the greater powers that exist in the universe. The third area of involvement is the visitors' building of establishments in the world in strategic locations, near population centers, where their influence on the mental environment can be exercised. And lastly, we spoke of their program of interbreeding with humanity, a program which has been underway for quite some time.",
        "text_source": "In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here.",
        "text_source": "It seems to many UFO abduction investigators that the latter remark describes precisely what seems to be lacking in both the ETs and in the transgenic beings we believe they are coproducing with our involuntary help. The evidently cloned children with alien-human appearance that Jen saw on the playground seemed passive, expressionless, and unused to the simplest of sensations-like the feel of sand trickling through one's fingers. It's no wonder these transgenic children seen aboard craft might be described as having the failure to thrive syndrome. They seem thin, listless, and nonresponsive. Do the aliens expect these children to take their places in our society as Mr. Paige and Damoe evidently did? Or do these children represent an interim stage in an overall alien plan to develop beings more like us in many ways-with our vital genetic diversity and our emotions, which actually have a survival purpose in our society. Or perhaps we flatter ourselves with this speculation, and all the ETs are interested in is getting the technical part right. They seem to have gone a long way toward producing serviceable facsimiles of humans who answer to them. The models seem to be getting better and better. The old debate still rages on over what is the most powerful influence to shape human beings (or any sentient being): Is it nature or nurture? But it's possible that both our great human vulnerability and our strength lies in our ongoing desire to attend to both equally. We earthlings value our science; we don't mind tinkering with nature if it seems to confer some genetic advantage on us, rather than the next guy; we're even drawn to some of the more radical new abilities of genetics to make designer babies free of defects. But we know that nature won't paint the whole picture, either-that these small bundles of neurons, muscles, blood, and bone, these offspring of ours, will also grow out of the environment we create and the examples we set. We will need to intentionally nurture our children into becoming loving, empathetic, and ethical adults, responsible to the rest of society. But what happens to a species like ours that might become infiltrated by a subpopulation of bioengineered people who never knew the nurturance side of the equation? ETs may be on the way to creating an increasingly perfect facsimile of a human being, but we don't yet see convincing evidence that they understand what lies behind the scenery of a fully fleshed-out human existence-qualities such as emotional openness, the courage to act independantly as a moral being, the desire to nurture others as you were once nurtured-or to nurture another person even if you were not. We don't know if this new variant species of mankind, intentionally created by the Other, is here to offer us earthlings fresh knowledge and profound insights from the farside of the cosmos, or whether it intends to deliberately betray us into the service of its own extraterrestrial creators. In the meantime, it seems that all we can do is to continue to bear witness and offer modest emotional support-through conversations, letters, phone calls, and writing-to the thousands of people undergoing these experiences. We, as well as the abductees, look toward the day that it dawns on the scientific, political, educational, and spiritual institutions of this small planet that their understanding and guidance are terribly lacking in dealing with this strange experience that touches every dimension of what it means to be human."
