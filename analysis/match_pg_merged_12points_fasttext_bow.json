        "text_source": "The U.S. government-funded SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, which operates on the assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio waves out into the universe, illustrates this bias. The possibility that advanced intelligences might not choose to communicate with us through such a tiny or limited technological aperture, seeking perhaps some fuller opening of our consciousness, seems not to have occurred to its inventors. As philosopher Terence McKenna has suggested, \"To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant\" (McKenna 1991). It is not altogether clear to me why we become so attached to our ways of seeing the world. Perhaps a comprehensive scientific paradigm, like any ideology, gives a sense of mastery and power. Mystery and the sense of not knowing are antithetical to the need to maintain control and seem, at times, to inspire such terror that we fear that we might blow apart, like the frog in the Tibetan story when confronted with a universe too vast to comprehend. This might explain why it is the intellectual and political elite in our culture that seems most deeply wedded to perpetuating the materi alist view of reality. The UFO abduction phenomenon, which strikes at the heart of the Western paradigm and reveals us to be utterly without control, is more readily accepted at the grassroots level than by the culturally sophisticated or most intellectually advanced among us. For it is, to a large degree, the scientific and governmental elite and the selected media that it controls that determine what we are to believe is real, for these monoliths are the principal beneficiaries of the dominant ideology. This \"politics of ontology\" (Mack 1992) is then the primary arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our homes and abduct our people would create particular problems . This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories. There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the meaning of our \"power\" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik Erikson called .. pseudospeciation\"}, is the source of prodigious suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distraction from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking the phenomenon and its implications seriously. The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of economic \"indicators\" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called \"market forces\") is not controlled, inequities in the distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen, giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It does not, cannot, \"save\" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed, the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,, profoundly \"enlightening\" in the fullest sense. The UFO abduction phenomenon presents a particular problem for some organized religions. From the beginnings of history groups of human beings, recognizing the power and potential perils of spirit forces \"out there,\" have taken upon themselves the task of guiding us through the \"ultimate matters\" (Zock 1990) of life. Religious leaders instruct us in the nature of God, and determine for us what spirit beings or other entities may exist in the cosmos. The Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, for example, in its zeal to impose a particular sort of monotheism based on the Trinity, quite ruthlessly suppressed the nature-worshipping polytheism of much of Europe."

        "text_source": "Using a genetic fingerprinting method on the infants, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues revealed in the British journal Human Reproduction, that genes from the donor cytoplasm are definitely present in some of the babies, along with those of the moms and dads. But the researchers are emphatic that the additional genes of the third-party donors are inconsequential and won't have any effect on the children's characteristics. Not so fast, say ethicists writing in the journal Science. The donated cytoplasm of these eggs contains more than just proteins to help the egg grow. It also holds mitochondria, the tiny structures that manufacture energy for the cells out of oxygen and nutrients. And mitochondria contain their own genetic material. The ethicists suggest that these experiments would never have been approved by the federal committee that oversees genetic work. But, because the work was privately funded, the researchers weren't required to get anyone's permission except the parents-all three of them. In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_source": "Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear."

        "text_source": "It seems to many UFO abduction investigators that the latter remark describes precisely what seems to be lacking in both the ETs and in the transgenic beings we believe they are coproducing with our involuntary help. The evidently cloned children with alien-human appearance that Jen saw on the playground seemed passive, expressionless, and unused to the simplest of sensations-like the feel of sand trickling through one's fingers. It's no wonder these transgenic children seen aboard craft might be described as having the failure to thrive syndrome. They seem thin, listless, and nonresponsive. Do the aliens expect these children to take their places in our society as Mr. Paige and Damoe evidently did? Or do these children represent an interim stage in an overall alien plan to develop beings more like us in many ways-with our vital genetic diversity and our emotions, which actually have a survival purpose in our society. Or perhaps we flatter ourselves with this speculation, and all the ETs are interested in is getting the technical part right. They seem to have gone a long way toward producing serviceable facsimiles of humans who answer to them. The models seem to be getting better and better. The old debate still rages on over what is the most powerful influence to shape human beings (or any sentient being): Is it nature or nurture? But it's possible that both our great human vulnerability and our strength lies in our ongoing desire to attend to both equally. We earthlings value our science; we don't mind tinkering with nature if it seems to confer some genetic advantage on us, rather than the next guy; we're even drawn to some of the more radical new abilities of genetics to make designer babies free of defects. But we know that nature won't paint the whole picture, either-that these small bundles of neurons, muscles, blood, and bone, these offspring of ours, will also grow out of the environment we create and the examples we set. We will need to intentionally nurture our children into becoming loving, empathetic, and ethical adults, responsible to the rest of society. But what happens to a species like ours that might become infiltrated by a subpopulation of bioengineered people who never knew the nurturance side of the equation? ETs may be on the way to creating an increasingly perfect facsimile of a human being, but we don't yet see convincing evidence that they understand what lies behind the scenery of a fully fleshed-out human existence-qualities such as emotional openness, the courage to act independantly as a moral being, the desire to nurture others as you were once nurtured-or to nurture another person even if you were not. We don't know if this new variant species of mankind, intentionally created by the Other, is here to offer us earthlings fresh knowledge and profound insights from the farside of the cosmos, or whether it intends to deliberately betray us into the service of its own extraterrestrial creators. In the meantime, it seems that all we can do is to continue to bear witness and offer modest emotional support-through conversations, letters, phone calls, and writing-to the thousands of people undergoing these experiences. We, as well as the abductees, look toward the day that it dawns on the scientific, political, educational, and spiritual institutions of this small planet that their understanding and guidance are terribly lacking in dealing with this strange experience that touches every dimension of what it means to be human."

        "text_source": "  Despite the numerous examples of aggressive and humiliating hybrid behavior, the existence of \"benign\" independent hybrid activity and the \"peaceful\" and even polite demeanor of the gray aliens have led some abductees and researchers to conclude that the abduction phenomenon is a positive force. This growing group has launched a crusade to convince the public that the entire alien agenda is benevolent, helpful, and spiritually uplifting. \"I see the ET visitors-the so-termed 'alien humanoids'-as friendly and with positive motivations and beneficial effects.\" So writes Dr. John Hunter Gray (fonnerly John Salter), professor of Indian Studies at the University of North Dakota, committed social activist, winner of the Martin Luther King award for civil rights work, and an abductee. Hunter Gray consciously remembered being abducted with his son in 1988. From the fragments he recalled of the event, he knew that kindly extraterrestrials were visiting Earth and that he was personally enhanced by their abduction of him. His view is typical of those of researchers and abductees who believe that aliens are benevolent beings who have come to Earth to help humans on both a personal and a societal level. Since the early 1980s the Positives have espoused the belief that humanity is fortunate to have been chosen for this beneficence. Influential Proponents  In addition to John Hunter Gray, there are several other Positive proponents who have shaped a segment of public opinion about the meaning of abductions and the aliens' ultimate intentions. One of the first to champion the idea that aliens are on Earth for our benefit was University of Wyoming professor of Guidance and Counseling Leo Sprinkle. An early pioneer in abduction research, beginning hypnosis in the mid-1960s, Sprinkle concluded that the simple explanation that beings come to Earth for their own purposes was insufficient. Eventually Sprinkle developed the rationale that \"there are two themes to the ET [extraterrestrial] purpose; 1, ETs are here to rejuvenate planet earth and 2, ETs are here to assist humankind in another stage of evolution.\" The ETs' method of showing mankind that they are here to help us, he explained, is \"through a metamorphosis of human consciousness.\"! The metamorphosis takes place, in part, through the lessons that wise aliens teach humans about cosmic matters. The aliens often communicate these lesson through channeling. In the course of his research, Sprinkle came to realize that he himself is an abductee. In 1980, Sprinkle held the first of his annual conferences in Laramie, Wyoming, which has become a central meeting place for followers of the Positive point of view. At the conferences, Sprinkle often takes questions from concerned individuals about abductions or sightings and \"channels\" the meaning of the person's event, directly asking the aliens questions and relating the answers. This total acceptance of the spirituality of the abduction phenomenon has made him popular with many abductees and researchers influenced by New Age thought. Another proponent of Positive themes is Richard Boylan, a former private practice psychologist in Sacramento, California, and also an abductee. Like Hunter Gray and Sprinkle, Boylan interprets his abduction experiences as profoundly benevolent and beneficial for him. His aliens are environmentally minded creatures who want to raise people's consciousness about Earth's problems and humanity's place in the cosmos. According to Boylan, the \"mission\" of the aliens \"is to communicate to humans the concerns the ETs share-concerns about our violence toward each other and our government's violence toward them; about the ecological destruction and degradation we are visiting upon our earth; about our failure to properly care for and educate each child; about our possession of, and intended use of, nuclear weapons as a way to resolve disputes; and about our becoming more conscious of our heritage and our destiny (which both involve the ETs).\" Boylan believes that the aliens will reveal themselves eventually, and at that time a \"conditioned\" humanity will not be afraid. When the great event comes, we will welcome the friendly aliens with open arms as we join with them in universal fellowship. We look forward as some of the implications of ET-human relationships develop when we finally get to CEIV [Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind-that is, abductions], the open, official, mutually welcomed, meeting of our earth's representatives with the representatives of these other star civilizations, and then we finally have a truly multiracial world, racial in its true sense of races from other planets since we are only one human race with different colors and bone structures and so forth.... If we get rid of our nuclear weapons and our gun-slinging attitude towards solving problems by outdrawing the other guy, then we will be ready for admission into the intergalactic UN, if you will. We can look forward to cultural exchanges or representatives from earth and other civilizations because they have other things to learn from us just as we have other things to learn from them and this may involve the actual exchange of people going to other planets to observe their society and their representatives here walking among us. To Boylan, the aliens are even more acceptable because they believe in a form of Supreme Being and therefore confirm Judeo-Christian monotheism: \"The ETs, too, realize that there's a Supreme Being or a supreme source of everything. They're not kidded that they are the top of the pile either. They acknowledge a supreme source out there-the fountainhead of all life. \" A significant influence on the Positives' belief system has been Massachusetts researcher Joseph Nyman, who began hypnotic regressions of abductees in the late 1980s and added \"past lives\" to the Positives' vision. When he regressed them to early childhood to recover the first abduction memories, he found he could take some of his subjects back to when they were infants, then back to the womb, and then to a \"past life.\" A few of them \"remembered\" that they had lived their past lives as aliens. Nyman hypothesized that abductees were taken from the time they were babies because they already had existed as aliens in past lives. Not only does Nyman find that many abductees think they were aliens in a past life, but he also suggests that some abductees possess an alien's \"consciousness,\" which imbues their present human form. For Nyman, the evidence is \"overwhelming\" that the aliens impose these dual feelings-human and alien-on the abductees. \"It implies the taking up of residence in the human form at birth (or before) of a fully developed intelligence which for a while is aware ' of both its human and non-human nature and of the prearranged monitoring to be conducted throughout life.\" Abductees and aliens have \"melded\" together in some way and in a sense abductees and aliens are the same. Abductees live their present lives with a \"dual reference,\" human and alien.6This allows the abductee to feel a positive connectiveness to the aliens with a resultant loss of \"fear, anxiety, and self-doubt.\" Perhaps the most significant spokesperson for the Positive viewpoint is John Mack of Harvard University. As Mack examined the established structure of abductions, he concluded that the aliens' goal was more than administering clinical procedures. Although Mack says the abduction phenomenon is \"mixed\" and not entirely positive, he believes abductions bring an opportunity for spiritual transformation and heightened consciousness. Mack has been influenced by psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who postulated that the human mind could connect with the \"collective unconscious,\" the universe, and all things animate and inanimate, present and past. Similarly, Mack believes that the abduction phenomenon has the potential, like Eastern metaphysical philosophies, to \"depict the universe and all its realities as a vast play of consciousness with physical manifestations.\" The effect of abductions can be \"personal growth,\" which results in \"an intense concern for the planet's survival and a powerful ecological consciousness.\" In addition. Mack thinks that Western society has cut itself off from \"awareness of any higher form of intelligence\" in the universe. In his view, the aliens have predicted the destruction of Earth by the encroachment of \"technodestructive and fear-driven acquisitiveness,\" and he suggests that the aliens may be using the hybridization program and visualizations of our self-destruction to bring about the healing of Earth and \"the further evolution of consciousness.\"\" Within this framework, Mack began hypnotic regression of abductees in 1990, hoping to \"push past\" their trauma and unveil the essential goodness of the alien higher consciousness. And like Nyman, he found that a number of abductees whom he hypnotized had lived past lives, sometimes as aliens. Mack concluded that even though most other abduction researchers have not found the past-life-as-alien account, Nyman's \"dual reference\" was a \"fundamental dimension of the consciousness expansion or opening that is an intrinsic aspect of the abduction phenomenon itself.\" As a credentialed Harvard faculty member with entree into mainstream intellectual life, Mack became an intellectually courageous and powerful advocate for the abduction phenomenon. Where he deviates from the mainstream is in his belief that the phenomenon transcends conventional ideas about the nature of reality. For Mack, understanding reality requires consciousness expansion that goes beyond traditional science. And such consciousness expansion can only be good for humanity. A growing number of abductees who are not abduction researchers have also found their experiences spiritually uplifting and transforming. At an abduction conference held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, abductee \"Susan\" explained that the \"communication\" she receives from \"the alien 'guardians' of our planet offers insight and wisdom to a world in need of it. It contains a message of love and support to a planet in need of healing.\" She also found personal benefit in the experience: \"Since my experience, I rejoice in being who I am, with no expectations of how I should be, and complete acceptance of who I am. The changes in me are staggering. My life works as if by magic... . Although at one time I thought 'Why me?' now I say \"Thank you for choosing me. '\"l 1  Abductee Leah Haley, who related her experiences in her book Lost Was the Key, believes that members of the American military- somehow in conjunction with the aliens-abducted her on many occasions and held her in a barrackslike building. Yet despite these clearly negative experiences, her view of the aliens is positive. In her children's book, Ceto's New Friends, Haley tells the story of the gray alien Ceto who comes to Earth and meets little Annie and Seth. The three play together, and Ceto invites them on board his UFO. They are happy to go, float up into the object, play various \"games,\" and then are floated back. On the final page, the two happy but weary children look longingly toward the UFO, and the story concludes with Haley writing that \"the Spaceship flew away, but Ceto will come back soon to visit his new friends on Earth.\" 12 Although most abductees have not gone as far as this in \"humanizing\" and sentimentalizing the aliens, Haley's viewpoint is a logical extension of the desire- perhaps the need-for the aliens to be friendly and helpful. Taken as a group, the Positives' message is that humans have conducted their affairs in a way that will lead to the degradation of the planet and the end of the human species. Humans have caused poverty, ignorance, and overpopulation, and they risk environmental catastrophe and atomic annihilation. The concerned aliens are \"educating\" abductees to warn us of what is to come if we do not change our behavior. The Positives argue that aliens are more fully evolved spiritually than humans, and that they have a heightened awareness of the mysteries of the universe. The aliens recognize the specialness of human life and are also aware of how humankind has erred. They respect the sanctity of human life even more than we do. They care about us and love us. The aliens are the teachers and we are the students. They are the parents and we are the children. They must teach us how to behave. Because they are a benevolent species, they have come to help us find solutions to our problems. Moreover, the Positives believe that alien guidance is not meant only for society in general. The aliens can help the individual ab-ductee to raise himself spiritually by giving him knowledge of higher realms of existence and the connectedness of all things. They can also aid individual abductees physically by curing various problems that they may have. John Hunter Gray was a recipient of alien largess. His body hair increased, his face and neck narrowed, many wri nk les and blemishes disappeared from his face, and his circulation and blood-clotting improved. He has not been ill since the abduction, and after forty years of smoking, he gave it up with no signs of nicotine withdrawal. He also has had expanded psychic abilities. 13 Hunter Gray is convinced that the aliens treat all people with the same kindness and respect that he received."

        "text_source": "Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

My research and study has proven to me that we, as a species that has a powerful spiritual side to its being, do have what it takes to create a new and sustainable future for our planet and ourselves. Sadly, it is late in the day for this realization, and there are many who still do not see the truth. But we must apply ourselves to the urgent needs of our species and our planet because, frankly, we do no have a single moment to waste. Our complete disregard for the environment has already taken an enormous toll on all living things, and is easily seen on a planetwide scale. As I write this, a sunken oil tanker sits at the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Spain. If its hull ruptures (and many experts believe it will), the oil it releases into the ocean will be double what was spilled by the Exxon Valdez. We cannot go on like this. Clearly, a change in human attitude is called for. In my view, the number of crop circles that are manmade versus those that are not, has become irrelevant. All the signs in the fields play a role in awakening mankind to the ongoing opportunity to reverse our self-destructive course and achieve true spiritual maturity. To convince the masses of the importance of this quest, however, we must all do our work, and speak our message, with humility, respect, and above all, honesty. We are all in this together: researchers, the lay public and those who make counterfeit crop circles."

        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

        "text_source": "Thomas told me he recalls that the blood-presumably from slaughtered animals-was obtained from a local farm. In an interesting letter to a magazine , written in 2001, he made some apposite references to the consumption of blood-without, of course, citing his own experience. Over the years, certain peoples have been vilified by modern attitudes against the terrors of blood sacrifices, he wrote. However, if genetically modified humans, ruled by their makers up to a time when they, our makers, leave the planet [and] have had at times to 'entertain' and consort with said makers, then they would have to provide the necessary correct food. . . .  What if there was, or is, a race of beings which have evolved to feed on blood? As simple as that. It may appal some of us, even possibly most of us, yet we are talking alien creatures here. A race apart. Light years apart. Evolving on a planet or planets away from and not far from this Earth. . . . So along comes a race of beings which lives on blood from animals rather than the meat. And when they arrive as 'gods' or powerful beings, we in due deference feed them with what they require. In this context, G and L related how their people had influenced the Inca, Aztec, and Maya cultures. For nutrition on their own planet, G and L indicated that they also consumed other liquids of varying thicknesses, from water through to heavy soups, plus a variety of what we would term wines made from fruits and vegetables growing on their own planet. ESPIONAGE When Thomas's leave period came up, he went to his home in Barnstaple, Devon. Waiting  at  Taunton  station  for  the  connecting  train,  he  was approached by a well-dressed, well-spoken man who invited Thomas for a cup of tea. I can always tell an airman, he said. Acknowledging the fact, Thomas explained that he was on 72-hour leave. Over tea, the man asked Thomas what he did in the RAF. He replied in vague generalities, mentioning Bomber Command and admin work. Ah, so you are in the RAF but with the Fleet Air Arm crowd? Yes, I know all about that. An interesting posting, no doubt. Thomas gave nothing away. As the steam train for Barnstaple drew in, the stranger invited Thomas to join him in a First Class compartment. Sitting opposite this man in an empty carriage, a strong feeling of unease crept over Thomas, particularly when the stranger placed a hand on his knee. Don't worry. Here's my card. I am an MP [Member of Parliament]. My name is Tom Driberg. The  notorious  homosexual  MP  for  Barking,  Driberg  (later  Lord Bradwell)-a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and a close friend of the traitor Guy Burgess-had links with the Soviet KGB and its Czechoslovakian counterpart. Coincidentally, Driberg happened to be staying for the weekend at the Imperial Hotel in Barnstaple, and Thomas was invited for tea in his room at the hotel to show his paintings (which were never returned). Distinctly uncomfortable at the prospect, he nonetheless turned up and managed to resist Driberg's approaches, not least being his persistence in trying to gather information regarding the nature of Thomas's work. Thomas was also invited, together with his girlfriend, to attend a play at the Queen's Hall Theatre. During the evening, a local couple who were friends of Driberg's introduced Thomas to Driberg's friend Lord Robens. Alfred Robens (Baron Robens of Woldingham), a well-known industrialist , trade unionist, and Labour politician, was shadow foreign secretary at that time. After the show, a drinks party was held at the couple's home, during which Driberg made further passes at Thomas and offered to give him a camera to record his activities at the camp. Thomas retorted that cameras were forbidden. Back at Weston Zoyland, G and L expressed complete knowledge of, and disquiet at, the weekend's developments, though they were well aware that Thomas had betrayed nothing sensitive. FURTHER EDUCATION Sometimes days went by with nothing said by G and L. But over the months a great deal of fascinating information was imparted to the team, described by Thomas in great detail in his book. The aliens communicated that they had visited Earth over a long period. As a naturalist, the airman was  delighted  to  learn  a  great  deal  about,  for  example,  mythical  sea creatures on Earth millennia ago. The aliens, having visited Earth many times over many centuries, knew at firsthand about evolution and extinctions [and] spoke of other aliens who had visited Earth, carrying out their experiments. . . . It helped that G and L saw colors as we did and though their eyes were considerably larger they seemed to have eyesight and other senses akin to our own. While careful not to reveal the location of their home planet (which had  three  moons  and  was  in  a  solar  system  with  five  other  planets  of similar size), the aliens were forthcoming regarding a description of same, describing their planet in great detail, to which Thomas devotes considerable space in his book-describing numerous types of creatures, some very similar to our own. The aliens reiterated that the overpopulation of Earth, combined with pollution, would lead to catastrophic consequences during the 21st century. Everything they had observed on this planet in previous millennia was recorded on crystals and retained on the mother craft, which transported them and their smaller craft. They could have shown us much on their screens in the craft still held in the camp, said Thomas, but they did not completely trust our seniors, hence the craft remaining closed. REASONS FOR ROSWELL G and L discussed the so-called Roswell incident, which, as we learned earlier, was said to have involved three craft. The remains of the damaged craft will continue to be examined, as will medical analysis of our people. Both have been examined so intensely since your year of 1947 that it is surely time our people were laid to rest and not be moved constantly from liquid solutions and frozen state to be further examined by your scientists and, we fear, at least one alien race your people consort with. . . . Following the ends of World Wars I and II, the aliens contacted our leaders-in  1919  and  1946  respectively-to  openly  offer  their  assistance, and to be seen to do so, but were rebuffed. So they informed the American and British military and governments of their intention to offer scientific instruments to forward human progress rapidly and without cost. Thus did the Roswell event occur, with its subsequent spreading of falsehoods. The Code Orange team were informed that the reason the aliens visited New Mexico owed largely to the siting of American military bases there, including  one  site  that  received  and  transmitted  messages  from  beings other than themselves. They also said that New Mexico and a neighboring state had alien bases built into mountain sides beneath the ground (such as the Manzano Mountains, I learned from another source) and that a to-ing and fro-ing of American military and government personnel (the latter including numerous scientists, I have been told) had occurred up to the time G and L had been transported to Britain at their own insistence. Our own activities required monitoring by other than human beings, Thomas explained, simply because Earth is a vital and necessary planet for others. We could not be permitted to despoil it, even though despoliation had begun and we were doubted as to our integrity and genuine concern for the planet and its myriad life forms. G said, much to our disappointment, that humans could be seen as a malign race, and we were partial aliens in any case. CATTLE MUTILATIONS G indicated that a number of beings of a certain race had been collecting samples of our animals and plants. This was mainly in the USA, the then-current project involving cattle, which they did not possess-but intended to. They said the powers that be know about it, Thomas explains, and compensation was paid to cattle owners who reported losses. It needs to be pointed out here that in this time period (1955\u201357) the cattle mutilation phenomenon was unknown to the general public. It was not until several decades later that researchers became aware of it. As Colonel Philip J. Corso reveals in his book The Day After Roswell:  In 1997 this may sound like a nightmare out of a flying saucer horror movie,  but  in  1957  this  was  our  thinking  both  in  the  White  House [National Security Council Staff, of which Corso was a member] and in the military. We didn't know, but we had irrefutable evidence that EBEs [Extraterrestrial Biological Entities] were landing on farms, harvesting vital organs from livestock, and then just leaving the carcasses on the ground because they knew we couldn't do anything about it. The mutilations that interested the National Security personnel seemed to have the same kind of modus operandi. Whoever went after the animals seemed most interested in the mammary, digestive, and reproductive organs, especially the uteruses from cows. In many cases the eyes or throats were removed in a type of surgery in which the demarcation line was almost microscopically thin and the surrounding tissue showed that the incision had superheated and then blackened as it cooled. But the crime scene and forensic specialists noted that in any type of cut by a predatory animal or a human-even a skilled surgeon-one would find evidence of some trauma in the surrounding tissue [but] forensic examination showed no evidence of collateral trauma or even inflammation, [implying] the cuts to extract the tissue were made so quickly and wounds were sealed so fast that the surrounding tissue was never destroyed. . . .  We asked would it not have been simpler to have had a farm on which all the necessary animals, and presumably plants too, could have been part of a humane project to avoid hurting cattle and such, Thomas writes. We were told 'hurt' did not come into it. The aliens used what we now know as a form of laser [which] immediately kills the target. At least, they said, it was so in this instance, but the extremely intense beam was mainly used for surgical operations to heal. . . .  Corso provides confirmation that what turned out to be a laser device was found by the Army in the Roswell spacecraft and would later develop as a weapon in co-operation with Hughes Aircraft. As head of the Army's Foreign Technology Division, Corso himself assembled the information to support laser product development with military funds before the whole operation was turned over to one of the Research and Development specialists. THE PATH TO DOOM Four hundred Earth years was the average life span for these aliens (as with certain other species). G and L were adamant that all answers to our future and all the lessons of history had been written down for us to learn from and live by. Each major  culture  and  each  primitive  culture  had  its  standards,  explained Thomas, but the move from a basic, primitive life to a life where selfish motives, however noble we tried to make them seem, prevailed, could and would lead to disaster and the final extinction of the human race. Our Christian Bible, supposedly, was the full account of ourselves, the written path of homo sapiens. There may well be many truths passed down in the Bible-as in many other religious documents-as I have remarked on later. But I find it puzzling that the aliens failed at least to acknowledge some of the inconsistencies in various translations of the Bible over the centuries. Exactly how much of it is factual? Thomas's team had no axe to grind in this regard. By their own admission, they were neither atheists nor practicing Christians in the recognized manner, as Thomas puts it. However, G and L did indicate that we were a world of too many religions, and would suffer for being so. They said the core of our numerous religions and creeds was a good and right way forward, but eventually humans would sacrifice their beliefs in a selfish manner, and our leaders would lazily accept this. . . . I remember how G placed his hand upon his chest and 'said' the incident at Roswell, New Mexico, and certain others, was a part of the 'Path to Doom' for the human race. He said items stolen from them at that time would show us how to live well and prosper greatly in a way that no human need ever go hungry or thirsty, and all human problems could be solved using their technology before the century we called the twentieth ended. But, he added, those in power will not wish it; rather would they have what they see as greater power. The aliens acknowledged the existence of Jesus, furthermore indicating that the so-called Second Coming was already in force (as also implied by Henry Dohan in Chapter 7). OFFICIALDOM FRUSTRATED On several occasions, the duty officer complained to the team regarding official frustration at their inability to gain access to the inside of the craft. One of the team, Ian, said they'd done all they could-as would have been evident on the taped recordings of all their communications to, if not from, G and L. Several days later, the aliens responded, pointing out that the craft contained a self-destructive device which would operate if entry by any beings other than themselves was accomplished. They made it very clear, said Thomas, that they could open the craft in a matter of seconds in human time, and seal it closed just as rapidly. Only massive power could open it falsely. They told us the problem at Roswell was that having come in peace to exchange thoughts and certain technology, the mechanism of self-destruction concealed behind the small panel, with what we called a pentacle on it, was switched off. It seems G and L and their missing friend switched theirs to 'on' again before the craft closed. . . . G and L told us they had no intention at this time to open the craft. When I first met Thomas, he told me that this craft had come down of  its  own  volition  while  the  military  combed  the  site  where  the  other craft had crashed. He said that G and L were upset about the cruelty and treachery of their American captors in betraying their word. Given their wide knowledge of human fallibility, one can only wonder at the apparent na\u00efvet\u00e9 of G and L in this respect. ANCIENT HISTORY The aliens expounded on their presence here on Earth thousands of years ago. Like the species with whom Carl Anderson liaised (Chapter 7), G and L described how their own people had been present during the times of the many kings (named Pharoahs after 950  b.c.) who ruled Ancient Egypt, and how the aliens were described as Gods, but of course they were not. Thomas's team was advised not to mock what is written in the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud, or similar writings that foretell the future. For example, the great flood did occur and destroyed cities and countries, but mountains were left dry and habitable. They told us that a simple, basic change in the Earth's axis angle had caused  the  vast  flooding,  and  that  included  the  destruction  of  the  lost land of what we now call Atlantis, which lay close to what is the island of Cuba. They produced maps of those places and times showing Antarctica before it was ice-bound, and land bridges before the final dividing of the land masses which were one. They told us these maps exist today copied onto the skins of antelopes in our sixteenth century, but only one has been shown to present humans, yet thirty of them exist even now in the land known as Turkey. They explained how their presence in Central America at a place known as Aztlan was to obtain gold and to enrich cultures and races that preceded the Mayas, [and] the forefathers of Aztecs were the people of Aztlan and that the great floods drove them from their original, ancestral homeland. The aliens needed gold-and later silver-exclusively as part of their craft's propulsion system. THE MOTHERSHIP At around 23:00 one pleasant warm night in 1957 at Weston Zoyland, Thomas became aware of a strange presentiment. There was little sound to begin with, he wrote, then a few shouts and the noise of vehicles, then the noise of a helicopter. But then our office phone rang. 'Code Orange! Code Orange! Have you any problems? I need an immediate appraisal of your situation.' Alan came rushing in, saying, 'Come outside quick! Lights, zooming about. Amazing!' Thomas reported the matter, adding that he was going outside to see what was happening. Watch the aliens, he was told. Do not leave them alone. Our two friends were fine, noted Thomas, seated up against their 'home'  couches  and  staring  ahead. I  asked  if  they  were  all  right  and, receiving affirmation, went to look outside, leaving [colleagues] Keith and Cyril with them. 'Do not be concerned,' one said. 'We are passing messages to our people. You can so inform your seniors later.' The lights-a dozen or so glowing orange and green spheres a bit larger than a tennis ball, Thomas guessed-could be seen zooming and hovering in a controlled manner. Forces personnel rushed around, concentrating on the No. 1 hangar, its protective portcullis already up. One of the spheres came close enough to Thomas to touch. The only sound he detected was like that of a bumble-bee. They watched two of the green spheres bob and bounce along the top of the electrified inner perimeter fence; then they returned to the hangar and sat with the aliens, letting Keith and Cyril watch the display."

        "text_source": "In this worldview the various spirit entities, God or gods and other mythic beings that peoples throughout the world, including in our own culture, experience as altogether real have no objective reality. They are the subject matter of psychology and psychopathology, anthropology, religious study, and science fiction, the projection outward of the perceptions and images of the brain. If we make these entities real, it is through metaphor and symbol, as poets do so well. To acknowledge that the universe (or universes) contains other beings that have been able to enter our world and affect us as powerfully as the alien entities seem able to do would require an expansion of our notions of reality that would all too radically undermine the Western scientific and philosophical ideology which Tulane philosopher Michael Zimmerman calls \"naturalistic humanism\" (Zimmerman 1993). The alien beings that appear to come to us from the sky in strange spacecraft present a particularly confusing challenge to such a naturalistic or objectivist ideology. For they seem to partake of properties belonging to both the spirit and the material worlds, bridging, as if effortlessly, the division between these realms which has become increasingly sacred and unbreachable since science and religion went their separate ways in the seventeenth century (Toulmin 1990). On the one hand these beings seem able to be seen by the abductees, who feel their bodies moved and find small lesions inflicted upon them. On the other hand the beings seem to come, like intermediaries from God or the Devil, from a nonembodied source, and they are able to open the consciousness of abductees to realms of being that do not exist in the physical world as we know it. Before concluding I will speculate about why the barrier between the spirit and material worlds has become so entrenched in the West. For it is this pos1 sibly false dichotomy that makes our confrontation with beings who do not respect this gulf so shocking. SPIRITUAL IMPLICATIONS I am often asked how experiences that are so traumatic, and even appear cruel at times, can also be spiritually transformative. To me there is no inconsistency here, unless one reserves spirituality for realms of the sublime that are free of pain and struggle. Sometimes our most useful spiritual learning and growth comes at the hands of rough teachers who have little respect for our conceits, psychological defenses, or established points of view. Zen Buddhist teaching is notorious for its shock treatment methods. One might even go further and argue that genuine spiritual growth is inevitably disturbing, as the boundaries of consciousness are breached and we are opened to new domains of existence. This does not, of course, \"forgive\" the cruelties associated with the abduction phenomenon. The alien beings that abductees speak about seem to many of them to come from another domain that is felt to be closer to the source of being or primary creation. They have been described, however homely their appearance, as intermediaries or emissaries from God, even as angels, by Carlos for one. The acknowledgment of their existence, after the initial ontological shock, is sometimes (see Peter 's and Catherine's cases, for exrunple) the first step in the opening of consciousness to a universe that is no longer simply material. Abductees come to appreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itself intelligent. They develop a sense of awe before a mysterious cosmos that becomes sacred and ensouled. The sense of separation from all the rest of creation breaks down and the experience of oneness becomes an essential aspect of the evolution of the abductee's consciousness, as Joe spoke of in relation to his own and his baby son's development. Joe felt the choice he was facing was, as he put it, between oneness and insanity. The aliens themselves may come to be seen as a split-off part of the abductee's soul or Self; his or herown reensoulment requires the integration of this separated dimension. Many abductees with whom I have worked, including several not written about in this book, experience a kind of ecstasy which, as in Carlos's case, can reach orgasmic proportions as they feel themselves open through their experiences (or the reliving of them) to a divine source or creative center of being in the cosmos. This source is, to the abductees, inexpressibly luminous and filled with color, and they may weep when they find themselves in its presence, for separation from it was painful beyond words. When they do open to the source once again, they may call the experience a \"return\" and protest once again having to fulfill even a newly agreed upon purpose as a human being."

        "text_source": "Still, there is cause for believing that some Nazi technology during the war was of a genuine proto-UFO nature. There is even good reason to consider that, somewhere, someone was trying to build genuine flying saucers in the immediate aftermath of the war. But it must be emphasized that the evidence for this is slender, and based on a surprisingly small number of claims. Nor has it ever been answered satisfactorily where they were based, who built them, what their missions were, or what relation (if any) they had with pre-war sightings of apparent UFOs. And again, most important is the lack of any historical documentation leading us to a firm conclusion. One scenario that has often been raised is that the Nazis set up a base in Antarctica (Neu-Schwabenland) which became a major problem after the war's end, as it contained all their advanced science and weaponry. This in turn underlies the claim that the American expedition known as Operation Highjump, which took place in late 1946 and early 1947, was in reality a failed military expedition against the secret Nazi base. Highjump was indeed a large expedition, including 13 ships and nearly 5,000 men, and as recent scholarship has shown, it was designed to train the U.S. Navy for a possible war with the Soviet Union in the Arctic, and not to attack an alleged German base in Antarctica. The Operation did end earlier than scheduled, and there were also deaths, but all of the problems appear explainable by bad weather, which became quite serious by February 1947. The Commander of Highjump, Admiral Richard Byrd, gave a statement to the March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper, El Mercurio. This is sometimes used to indicate that Byrd was hinting at the reality of dangerous, revolutionary, technology in Antarctica. In fact, his statement does not appear to do this. The article, in part, reads as follows:  Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking-recalled the admiral-is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety. Unless one decides to speculate that Byrd was speaking in code, there is no justification for interpreting his statement any other way than how it was reported, barring new facts or developments. Moreover, if Highjump ended in disaster, why then were subsequent, smaller expeditions sent to the same region later in 1947 and 1948? Such was Operation Windmill, described as an exploration and training mission in 1947-1948. In addition, the private explorer Finn Rone organized an expedition to the same area at this time. In other words, the idea of a Nazi base in Antarctica has no foundation, only speculation. So the Nazi-UFO connection, just like the ET-UFO connection, offers its own frustrations and dead-ends. And yet, we can at least acknowledge the genuine possibility that there was a connection, and that the Americans, British, Russians, and others were very interested in such Nazi technology. As Cook, Farrell and others have pointed out, it has always been suspected that Hans Kammler, who disappeared at the end of the war, went to work for the Americans. Moreover, there can be no question that a clandestine flying saucer program would have been desirable within the U.S. and possibly elsewhere in the immediate post-war era. This would presumably include science related not only to acquired technology-whether from Nazis or extraterrestrials-but also to the pioneering research of people like Nikola Tesla and Townsend Brown (both discussed in Chapter Eleven). The question is not was there a terrestrial effort to build flying saucers. Rather, whether or not this scientific work comprised the sum total of what we call the UFO phenomenon. That is, are UFOs a completely man-made phenomenon, and is the alien connection merely disinformation and a distraction? For those researchers who believe this, the reasoning is (a) that aliens from another planet, arriving in flying saucers that look like human designs from the 1940s, is implausible; (b) human science and technology is more than sufficient to explain the operation of UFOs, as long as we include hidden, suppressed technologies; and (c) the alien connection is pure disinformation designed to confuse the public from the reality of a fully terrestrial breakaway civilization that has no intention of sharing its technology with the masses. As I have been suggesting, and will continue to argue in this book, there is a certain logic to the position, but only if a substantial body of other evidence is ignored. Moreover, there is more evidence that the core UFO phenomenon derives from others not from our civilization. The Requirements of Secrecy   Let us return to 1947, to President Harry Truman, facing the shattering news that other beings of some sort were here. Moreover, that the U.S. military had recovered some of their technology, and even bodies. We may assume that this would require the creation of black budgets. After all, it would be necessary to fund these programs, and it would not exactly be the wisest idea to inform Congress about it, considering that so little would be known about these beings, considering the desire to keep such technology away from enemies real or perceived, and for so many other reasons already discussed. Thus, layer upon layer of secrecy would need to be established to hide these UFO-extraterrestrial technology programs. As we know has become the norm within the black budget world, such a program would be nested within other classified programs, providing deep layers of protection from outside observation. Such a program of secret study would also require ongoing influence and even control over mainstream radio, newspapers, and television. This does not mean that the CIA would control every piece of information coming through the media. It might mean, however, that there would be key, strategically placed, individuals who would influence stories as they came out. In other words, spin control: promoting certain types of stories and killing others. Over the years, there have been a number of expos\u00e9s detailing the relationship between the CIA and the news media. One was from 1977 by journalist Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame. Bernstein concluded that since the end of the Second World War, the CIA had recruited more than four hundred U.S. journalists and placed them secretly on its payroll. [165] Any private citizen might well ask what he or she could accomplish with four hundred journalists, many in highly influential positions, as secret employees? Certainly there would be a great ability to influence the news, and therefore influence public opinion. The same situation applies to the academic and scientific communities, as well as to Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Influencing them is easier than most people realize. With a few leading professors at the right institutions-Harvard, Princeton, UCLA, Berkeley, University of Chicago-the guard dogs would be in place. A young professor who develops an interest in UFOs would then be smacked down by the leading lights. In fact, this is known to have happened. Harvard astronomer Donald Menzel fulfilled precisely this role during the 1950s and 1960s. Not only was he the leading debunker of UFOs in the world during that period of time, but he had a secret relationship with the National Security Agency. Not even his wife knew about that. In today's world, such relationships are sometimes barely even concealed, as if no one cares. There is a virtual revolving door between the government/intelligence community and the most prestigious elements of the academic world. The situation is even worse in the world of scientific research, where everything is controlled by funding, and the largest share of funding for the scientific community comes from the U.S. government. Scientists who stray into areas not approved by their paymasters quickly find that they lose their funding, after which a loss of standing and prestige are a constant threat. These are very big incentives to toe the line. Thus, control moves beyond the classified world to become cultural. The Breakaway Civilization   What happens when teams of brilliant scientists, under conditions of total secrecy, and utilizing limitless black budget money, are able to study recovered extraterrestrial technology for many years, and even decades?"

Appendix 2, \"Astronomers' Sightings\")- This being the case, there appear, upon analysis, to be other, deeper reasons. A general school of thought has existed for close to two centuries that tends to dismiss the idea that terrestrial phenomena could be influenced from the outside. At the start, this was a positive, rational, and creative reaction to ancient beliefs. Compared with ancient times, modern science has, in fact, advanced by eliminating the gods. It would seem counterproductive and incongruous to bring them back in other forms. The idea prevails in almost all minds that man is master of the earth and, by extension, of the immediate cosmic vicinity, that it is the best nature can produce in this small comer of the galaxy, and that he alone remains the controller of his destiny. Various American philosophers have termed this concept \"anthropocentric humanism. \" To admit that intelligent [beings], which are not only outside [our planet] but are also superior due to their scientific and technological knowledge, could have interfered or might continue to interfere in our affairs, in our domain, or in proximity to it, is considered by many to be frightening and unacceptable, because admitting it would cause the collapse of the framework of comfortable thoughts of anthropocentric humanism. Moreover, in some disciplines such as physics, the risk run is to find oneself confronted with a science that is more advanced by several centuries, milleniums, or even more."

As abductee Judy Doraty was told by an alien grey when she asked about God, He's the same to us as He is to you. It would appear that religion-or more specifically spiritualism-is interconnected with the alien agenda. While most religions address facets of spiritual truth, none can claim exclusive knowledge. The world's religions can be compared to the story of the blind men and the elephant. They all have a piece of the truth, but their interpretations may not be on the mark. Today, many feel that organized religion is about the control of understanding. It is the mind of man trying to interpret the heart of God-and not doing a very good job of it. It has been said that every human feeling originates from only two basic emotions-love or fear. Love, the basis of compassion, sympathy, and understanding, stems from man's highest energy level, while fear, the producer of intolerance, hatred, and violence, comes from our basest energy level. Love, said to flow from God, is of the heart. Fear is a product of the mind. Unfortunately, too many religions focus on fear-fear of Satan, fear of death, and fear of the afterlife-to control members. All of humanity may be moving into a higher consciousness. Some call it Christ-Consciousness. There is no question that the old order-the old systems, the old ways of doing things-is crumbling. New dimensions, new realities are on the horizon. And each of us has a role to play. Mankind is only as strong as its weakest link. There are no victims or castaways. Everyone is involved. Each of us is like a tuning fork. When one resonates with the higher frequency of heartfelt love and understanding, others follow. Many feel that the aliens of energy and light, called the Tran-scendentals by the remote viewers, are here to witness-and perhaps help-our shift to new realities. It is literally a rebirth and, like any birth, there will be pain as we all move through the physical transitions. Fear will only make it worse. Yet, fear will continue to be a large part of our experience until we are able to break through the government secrecy and media-driven illusion of life to gain full knowledge of our world, our true history, our future, and our relationship with others in the universe. The advent of the UFO phenomenon on our collective consciousness in recent years may well be a wake-up call-a not-so-subtle message that human intellectual knowledge is not the end-all of existence or any assurance of peace and tranquillity. It won't be proven with a slide rule nor seen in a telescope. For true love and understanding, the basis for everything good and desirable, we must look inward. We all know truth when we hear it. It resonates deep within the individual being. We will know it by the subtle signals from the heart. Mankind in its present growth phase might be compared to the college student, who as a freshman believes she knows everything but as a senior realizes she knows very little. Our adolescence is coming to an end and it is time to break free from Mommy and Daddy-all dogmatic authority figures-and begin to take our rightful place as free-thinking and responsible members of a universal public. After all, to anyone not from Earth, we are the aliens-and fearsome ones at that with our primitive and destructive ways. Perhaps we are the focus of universal concern and are all being guided by a host of nonhuman life-forms. To paraphrase that great possum philosopher Pogo, We have found the alien agenda and it is about us."

        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_source": "This would seem to be a wonderful thing. Replacing oil is one of humanity's most coveted dreams. By now, everyone understands that the long-term future of our species, and our world, cannot include oil as our main source of energy. It pollutes horribly and harms life on Earth. A better, cleaner, more abundant source of energy would surely be more desirable, except from the point of view of those people who own the oil industry, some of the most powerful people in the world. For generations, they have monetized oil. What if the source of energy behind UFOs is impossible to centralize, and therefore harder to exploit for money? Aside from that, oil is the foundation of our world. Even under the most ideal conditions, transitioning out of an oil-dominated world would have a volatile effect on the global stock market and economic system. After all, most of the value of any consumer product is determined by the amount of energy that went into making and transporting it. Generally, that means oil. Therefore, if we say nothing else, we can conclude that the UFO phenomenon poses a threat to the established economic order: specifically to those wealthiest people and groups that own the greatest shares in the petroleum industry, and in general to the financial markets that would be shaken by the end of the oil era. Religious Implications   What would the admission of a UFO reality do to religion? Would it mean anything at all? The answer is yes, it would certainly mean something. Of course, the world has many different religions, so everything would depend on which one we mean. Still, to the extent that any religion deals with the creation of the world, the creation of mankind, and to the extent to which people today continue to believe in versions of those accounts, the UFO phenomenon has profound implications. This will be especially evident after we review the history of ancient UFOs, or ancient aliens, in the next chapter. Because, if it appears that they have been with us for a long time, many people will inevitably wonder if they were the gods of ancient times, or even God himself? It doesn't take an excess of imagination to see things in this way when reviewing the Hebrew Scriptures, for instance. Time and again, the God of the Israelites directly intervened to save the day, and had a very personal relationship with Moses. Other parts of that collection are also suggestive of aliens and their technology. The vision of Ezekiel comes to mind, in which the prophet beheld a wondrous apparition of angels in a flaming chariot in the sky. When you consider the ideas of the various ancient alien theorists, we naturally ask whether beings from elsewhere became our so-called gods and were instrumental in creating human religions. For practicing Christians, probably the most sensitive question would be: was Christ an extraterrestrial? What would it mean if he had been?"

        "text_source": "Perhaps the most important development of the period under review is how ufology turned its attention to the aliens themselves. It was one thing to study specific UFO sightings in an attempt to find patterns and understand the technologies involved. But what happened during the 1970s was the beginning of the first focused attempt by the human race to understand the beings behind the phenomenon, while making proper exception of course for those black-world people and groups who had (probably) already been trying to do this secretly. It was the moment in which the object of study \u2013 that is, humanity \u2013 attempted to turn the situation around and understand just who or what was studying it. The moment was a significant one not simply in the history of ufology, but of human consciousness. Such efforts were only the beginning, of course, and years later much still needs to be done. Understanding the intelligences behind the UFO phenomenon remains the great challenge of the subject. Developing the necessary insight will require a change not simply to our social, economic, and political world, but to our consciousness itself. Whoever and whatever these beings are, they appear to exist and act in ways that most humans are not prepared or able to match. In a world in which billions go hungry, and billions more spend their waking hours in repetitive jobs, mindlessly surfing the Internet, playing video games, or watching the television, it is safe to say that most people are not ready to deal with the existence of an alien race that may be of exceptional intelligence, and may well be telepathic \u2013 if numerous claims of abductees and experiencers are to be believed. Nor of an alien race that surely has an agenda of some sort."

        "text_source": "  Endings   The crop circles present us with a view of the world that is rich with meaning and metaphor; they make visible the very designs of matter and life. The spaces they create are an invitation to come and take part in an exploration of these universal structures; to recognize the connection of all things in the patterned fabric of creation. They also seem to suggest that these shapes and patterns are an intimate part of our own thought processes; and that they are an archetypal structure upon which not only matter and life are based, but also lie at the heart of the structure of consciousness itself. That sense of familiarity the circles sometimes evoke \u2013 that uncanny feeling that you know what these shapes are and what they mean, and that they are somehow vitally important \u2013 make so much more sense when looked at from this viewpoint. The circles seem concerned with rebalancing our world-view and our sense of reality. In their own way, they are raising awareness of the fact that there is meaning as well as function behind creation, and that life and everything concerned with it has an innate purpose. No matter how you feel that the crop circles may have originated, they are bringing a richness and depth of inspiration to the fore. They 'en-soul' our world and breathe life and colour into the scientific machinery currently used to describe our universe. The circles seem to engender a view that such machinery is but the skeleton or bare bones of the universe, and that what we now need to understand is the flesh, the life-blood and heart of the wonderful creation around us. Is there more to this reality than we can currently see? A cursory glance over the rich legacy of legend and myth held by our world's many cultures suggests that there is far more to our reality than we currently acknowledge in our minds and hearts. The crop circles are our 'signs and wonders', our symbols and guides, our dreams and aspirations made manifest in the fields. They are a counterbalance to the mechanical and functional reality that the western world promulgates. They are mandalas of healing that have spread across the face of the earth; they are an unconscious expression of our need to re-order and reconsider. In our turbulent times, the human race is faced with many choices and many dilemmas, and is being asked to re-evaluate its attitudes towards numerous issues, especially war and the environment. Perhaps the crop circles are an outward sign that this process is firmly under way. Throughout this book we have looked at a whole gamut of components which may be behind the crop circles. We have looked at earth energies, pizo-electrical effects, magnetic effects and the link between vibration and the formation of shape. We have looked at the astonishing use of number symbolism encoded in the circles and what some of that might mean. There are many possibilities for the origins of the circles: earth spirits, extra-terrestrials, extra-dimensional intelligences, Gaia (the consciousness of the earth itself) or, of course, large-scale international hoaxing. Whoever the circle-makers are it is clear they prefer anonymity; it seems to me that they wish to be known by the quality of the fruits of their labour; the crop circles themselves. To be only interested in their identity, or the method by which the circles are made, seems somehow crude in comparison with the elegant and thoughtful works of art they put before us. The crop circles have resisted every attempt made to pin them down or explain them away, and after over fifteen years of being close to this phenomenon I have come respect that. There will always be people who are more interested in probing the circles scientifically, or those who want to spend their time with them building a case to prove or disprove the hoax theory. I am, however, content to sit, watch the the crop circles unfold and pay careful attention. The circles invite us on a journey of mutual exploration; I have the sense that neither side knows where it will end, but that the whole point of our interfacing is ultimately about the quality of the interaction. We began this book by searching for a state of focused openness, one in which we suspended our world-view in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the beautiful crop circles. I suggest that rather than giving up and grasping for any explanation of this amazing phenomenon, we strive to maintain our openness, and approach the circles with the patient attentiveness that their works of art so gracefully demand. Even if the mystery of the crop circles is never answered conclusively, they will leave an enduring impact on those who took the time to observe them. They will have changed forever their view of life and reality. And for those who may come long after the circles have disappeared, these pictures will serve as a snapshot of these difficult but hope-filled times. Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. July 1991.

        "text_source": "13.3 Phase Three: Influences on Local Civilizations The third phase would be that of the influences that we would consider appropriate to exert on the environment and the civilizations encountered with a view to causing them to evolve in our fashion. It goes without saying that the advantages and risks would have to be studied carefully. 13.3.1 Influences on Preindustrial-Age Civilizations We might consider it necessary, in certain cases, to influence the environment in a specific manner and the evolution of local civilizations in a subtle way. It might seem necessary to us, upon completion of our observations and our analyses, to modify, bit by bit, the natural environment and the ecosystem by, for example, seeding or introducing select plants and organisms that are lacking. Likewise, the course of indigenous civilizations could be gradually modified by influencing, either from a distance or directly, the qualities or defects of select individuals, accentuating their intellectual and moral tendencies and their scientific knowledge, or by causing genetic mutations by different processes that are yet to be invented. In this case, it would be a matter of playing the roie that these populations would have willingly reserved for gods, who, by providing sacred texts. would reorient, for example, their sense of morals, their religiosity, and perhaps their laws and their political institutions. The use of elements likely to terrify and impress could be appropriate in some cases. And, with all due reverence, nothing would prevent one from thinking of different episodes in the Old Testament, the conditions under which the laws of Manu were instituted (10) or even the Koran given. The influences relate back to a certain number of enigmas in history, including. perhaps, the concomitant appearance of the great civilizations of the Indus, Mesopotamia, and Egypt (cities, architecture, writing, calendar, astronomy, etc.). They also call to mind the extraordinary map of the Antarctic, which was drawn almost free of ice by the Frenchman Oronce Fine in 1583, nearly three centuries prior to the discovery of this continent in 1820 (11). 13.3.2 Influences on Industrial-Age Civilizations The nature of these influences will vary according to the type of civilization, its technological development, and its psychological acclimatization or lack thereof to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. It would be advisable beforehand to accustom the mind of these populations to the idea of the probable existence of extraterrestrial civilizations (science-fiction novels, films, cartoon strips, video games, advertisements, a favorable psychological climate, [and] why not suitable sects?, etc.). New and essential technological knowledge could be provided via different avenues or by means of chance or provoked accidents with one of our spacecraft. The contemporary Roswell case thus comes to mind. In order for the craft to be retained in full (or disposed of), it would still have been necessary for the U.S. government to in fact have wanted to show, communicate and have analyzed, without beating around the bush, all of the elements that it actually recovered on that occasion. 13.4 Phase Four: Direct Contacts A fourth phase would be that of establishing direct contact with the locals or with entire populations, whether or not a vanguard of bionic robots were used. Once again, the goals sought must be precisely determined. The benefit and true utility of establishing such contacts must be weighed with care in order to calculate the risks and consequences. A specific program could plan for these. However, a serious technical accident affecting one of our spacecraft could be the start of an unofficial contact, a necessary settlement, or a colonization, or even, if necessary, an informationdisinformation campaign. It is also advisable to envision the sedition of some of our crews whom it might be necessary to disembark or who might decide on their own authority to live on one of the worlds discovered and, ultimately, mix with the indigenous populations, going against orders received, whether willingly or against their will, not to intervene or interfere in local affairs. These contacts presuppose that the worlds discovered are populated with human beings or hominids whose complexion is identical or close to oors. But under the hypothesis of contacts and planned long-term settlements of members of our crews, should mixes be prohibited, as prophylaxis, by imposing a major ban on them (12) or, on the contrary, should they be tolerated and even encouraged? Bear in mind that direct or prolonged contacts would inevitably lead the indigenous populations to believe, in fine, that we are not so different from them. It would be prudent, however, to send remotecontrolled androids in advance in order to assess the reactions that such an intrusion would arouse, or to acclimate the populations to the idea through furtive, episodic appearances. What would happen if we encountered populations composed of beings that were deformed or monstrous in our eyes? The visual effect would certainly be startling and a choice subject for their media and ours, but the types of contact would consequently be different, or at least we can assume so. 13.4.1 Direct Contacts with Preindustrial-Age Civilizations It is certain that such contacts would immediately cause the local populations to imagine that they are in the presence of gods. Historical parallels naturally come to mind: the arrival of the Spaniards in Central America in armor and on horseback, or, more generally, the arrival of the Europeans at the time of the discovery and exploration of the globe. The impact on populations that had never seen horses, armor that shone brightly in the sun, or white men, particularly with blond or red hair, had to be felt strongly. However, the shock of these apparitions would be quickly lessened with the multiplication of relations, and even more so if our crews were to take an eminent place in the local political and military orders. This, of course, relates back to the different epics of the discovery of the world, European colonization, and also the end of the western empires. 13.4.2 Direct Contacts with Industrial-Age Civilizations The day would come when we believed that these civilizations, gradually brought to our level through our efforts, are able to participate in our world. With the ground prepared in advance, contacts could, for example, be established discretely with select individuals or at the highest level of the States, or of some of them, and, if possible, be kept secret. Although leaks should not be ruled out, the leaders selected would then have to conduct information, disinformation, and counter-information campaigns to maintain the privileged nature of these relations and, who knows, to benefit, from our side, from novel scientific, technical, and political information, giving them an edge over their rivals. The selection of States, rulers, key figures, or mere individuals would, of course, be of paramount importance. Before or after the implementation of an influencing program, why not imagine having bionic robots that look like humans or resemble the living beings there appear in order not to risk the lives of members of our expeditions? Finally, why not purely and simply present ourselves openly and publicly? It is easy to imagine the huge sensation that this would cause in all psychological, political, military, strategic, and religious spheres, to say nothing of the media, [as well as the] multiple meetings and international colloquiums, uninterrupted sessions of organizations such as the UN, calls for \"world unity, \" international consultations, the creation of welcoming committees, etc. [that it would prompt]. The rivalry of the States would be interesting to observe. It goes without saying that our intentions must be perceived as peaceful. If this were not our policy, there would, of course, be no need to take special precautions to show consideration for the sentiments of the local populations. In all of these scenarios, we should encounter idolaters, sycophants, Herodians, who, out of a millenalist conviction, gullibility, pragmatism, or interest, would welcome us with enthusiasm as saviors, capable of solving all of their problems and bringing them peace and prosperity, preferably without having to exert much effort. These would be our first allies."

Although the subject was taboo at the time and I was advised against meeting other researchers, a young party official told me that sightings in the USSR were widespread and that the subject was followed with a great deal of interest. And at the Moscow Space Museum in 1971, during a concert tour with the London Symphony Orchestra, I saw a number of futuristic paintings depicting flying saucers-with one showing humanoid occupants. Fantasy? Or signposts to the future. The latest official announcements in the Soviet Union lend credence to the possibility that the late Dr. Hynek's fear may be realized: that the Russians will be the first to break the worldwide cover-up on UFOs. This is indeed an intriguing possibility, and the political and social consequences will, I am certain, have been given careful consideration by CIA analysts. I am equally certain that the Kremlin will have considered what political advantages are to be gained by making such an announcement. In 1920 a fascinating conversation took place between Lenin and H. G. Wells, which the latter related as follows:  I said to Lenin that the development of human technology might some day change the world situation. The Marxist conception itself would then become meaningless. Lenin looked at me and he said: \"You are right. I understood this myself when I read your novel The Time Machine. All human conceptions are on a scale of our planet. They are based on the pretension that the technical potential, although it will develop, will never exceed the 'terrestrial limit.' If we succeed in establishing interplanetary communication, all our philosophical, moral and social views will have to be revised. In this case, the technical potential, become limitless, would impose the end of the role of violence as a means and method of progress.\" There is no denying the possibility that once it is established beyond doubt that extraterrestrials are visiting our earth, the social, philosophical, scientific, and economic repercussions would have a profound effect on us all-irrespective of nationality. And should the visitors pose any kind of threat to humanity, the likelihood is that this will lead to an unprecedented degree of unity among nations. During the Geneva summit conference in November 1985 President Reagan made just this point to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when he told him \"how much easier his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this earth together.\""

        "text_source": "Abduction experiences also open the consciousness of abductees as I work with them to cycles of birth and death that are reminiscent of the Tibetan transitional realities or bardos (Sogyal Rinpoche 1992). This is most clearly illustrated in the past life experiences that are emerging increasingly in our sessions as I have become willing to listen to them. These reports suggest that individual consciousness may have its own line of development, separate from the body. In our sessions abductees such as Dave, Joe, Catherine, and Eva have told with great feeling of periods of embodiment, followed by deaths quite vividly reexperienced. They speak of a return to or diffusion into some sort of primal or universal creative consciousness or source, and then a later rebirth through a woman's womb into a new embodiment on Earth. The transition at the time of bodily death seems to include, as Joe recounted, a feeling of being literally lighter and thinner. \"It's good to be back,\" he said. 'This is much more real.\" Eva reported \"going up, expanding, joy.\" She went \"into a white, gold light\" and saw a dove released from a cage. ''That's my soul,\" she said. In certain cases the alien beings, who seem to reside or belong in this fluid dimension (although they periodically become embodied \u00b7 to some degree on Earth), seem to have been with the abductees through more than one lifetime. As discussed in considerable detail in Dave's and Joe's cases, it is possible to trace a development or evolution of consciousness in the sequence of lives that they have experienced over time. It is not necessary to postulate that a past life identity belongs literally to the individual abductee in the same way that our bodies are only ours while we inhabit them. As biologist Rupert Sheldrake has suggested, it is possible that there exi sts a kind of eternal collective memory on which we all may draw. One might, Sheldrake suggests, \"tune in to particular people in the past who are now dead, and, through morphic resonance, pick up memories of past lives.\" This does not prove, he says, that \"you were that person\" (Sheldrake 1992). This idea is consistent with the observation that the psyche or memory of the abductees seems to be able to travel, especially during the opening of consciousness that occurs in our sessions, to wherever or whenever the evolutionary requirement of the moment seems to take it. THE PARADIGM SHIFT Needless to say none of this makes much sense within the modern worldview brought to us by Western science, whose \"governing assumption,\" in philosopher Richard Tamas's words, is that \"any meaning the human mind perceives in the universe does not exist intrinsically in the universe but is projected onto it by the human mind\" (Tamas, in progress). To Tamas \"this complete voiding of the cosmos, this absolute privileging of the human\" is perhaps the ,\"ultimate anthropocentric projection, the most subtle yet prodigious form of human self-aggrandizement\" and represents an intellectual \"hubris of cosmic proportions.\" The experiences recounted by the abductees with whom I have worked during the past four years constitute, I think, a rich body of evidence to support the idea that the cosmos may contain at least a few types of beings or intelligences whose source and purpose is quite unknown to us. Abductees may be led through their experiences to feel that the cosmos is inherently intelligent in sub- , tie, complex, and exquisite ways that they can hardly begin to fathom. I am reminded, particularly, of Carlos here. Other evidence, including the thoroughly documented near-death experiences and extraordinarily intricate and symbolic crop formations appearing all over the world, provide additional indications, if we will allow ourselves to realize their implications, of various expressions of intelligence in a universe that is reaching toward us. As I come to the end of this story I cannot help wondering what it might take to bring about the shift in consciousness in the society as a whole, the change of paradigm, that is implicit in what the abductees have undergone. It would appear that what is required is a kind of cultural ego death, more profoundly shattering (a word that many abductees use when they acknowledge the actuality of their experiences) than the Copernican revolution which demonstrated that the earth, and therefore humankind, did not reside at the center of the cosmos. UFO abductions and related phenomena suggest first that humans are not the preeminent intelligent beings in a universe more or less empty of conscious life. But abductees' experiences also indicate that we are participating in a cosmos that contains intelligent beings that are far more advanced than we are in certain respects and have the power to render us helpless for purposes we are only just beginning to fathom."

        "text_source": " The publication of the hardcover edition of this book in April 1994 met with a strong response, both supportive and critical. I would like to take the opportunity of the paperback publication to express my appreciation to those who were open to what I have been learning. But I also feel that it is important to address some of the criticisms I have received, especially the charge that the work is an example of a kind of cult of irrationality, an exercise in anti-science and unreason. Upon reviewing the text of the book with the help of colleagues, it is apparent that my growing conviction about the authenticity of these reports, together with a sense of their great potential significance, resulted in a tendency to write as if the fact or reality of the experiences was established before the case had been made. In so doing, I may have denied some readers, especially those who would be naturally skeptical, the opportunity to make up their own minds. In this revised edition, I have altered the language in specific places to make clear that I am reporting the experiences of the abductees as told to me and not presuming that everything they say is literally true. Whether or not each of their communications is recorded with qualifying words like \"reported that\" or \"according to,\" the objective distance between me and the experiences implicit in such phrases should be understood throughout the text. Basic clinical scientific questions that have been raised, such as the status of physical evidence, the role of subject expectation or investigator influence, the reliability of memory, the accuracy of hypnosis, and the possibility of alternative explanations have been addressed in Appendix A. Finally, in order to improve the book's readability, the historical and crosscultural sections have been moved to the back (Appendix B), and the opening sections that contain my introduction and first reactions to learning about the abduction phenomenon have been streamlined. \u2022 The most archetypal expression of the cry of anti-science came from science writer James Gleick in a review in the New Republic magazine (Gleick 1994 ). Gleick called the \"alien-abduction mythology\" a \"leading case of the anti-rational, anti-science cults that are flourishing with dismaying vigor in the United States.\" He lumps the alien abduction phenomenon together with \"paranormals who bend spoons, parapsychologists who sense spiritual auras, crystal healers, believers in reincarnation\" and \"psychic crime-solvers\" as well as \"tarot readers and crystal ball gazers.\" In a similar vein psychoanalyst Sanford Gifford, in a review of my book for a psychoanalytic journal (Gifford, in press), called it a \"subversive assault on psychoanalysis as a science\" (he assumes that the phenomenon must be some sort of product of the unconscious mind), and wrote of the abduction experiencers as individuals \"holding irrational beliefs that are not shared by the 'compact majority.' \" In that sense, he continued, \"they are 'crazy' in the same way as believers in Creationism, faith healing, thought transference, or the end of the world on a specific date.\" Music critic (!) Milo Miles, reviewing Abduction in The Boston Globe worried that \"the secular world and the spirit world must be kept as separate as church and state.\" He concludes that \"Mack should beware that if rationality and objective truth are thrown out the door, no one can predict what will rush in through the opening (Miles 1994).\" I believe these critiques reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of rationality and reason, and even of science itself. For what the worldview implicit in these statements requires is the a priori exclusion of vast amounts of data simply because that information is in conflict with that point of view. This, I believe, is a far more irrational, and even dangerous, approach to knowledge than to allow information from every possible legitimate source to come into our minds before applying rationality and reason in assessing this information once we have \"let it in.\" To exclude data because it does not fit a particular view of reality can only, in the end, arrest the progress of science and keep us ignorant. The worldview that Gleick, Gifford, and Miles espouse is what is usually called the \"materialist paradigm.\" According to this view, which until recently has dominated mainstream science (although now it is increasingly being questioned, even in contemporary physics), there is only one hard rea_lity, namely that which is observable through the sensory/empirical mode. This dualistic approach would separate cleanly the observer from the observed, subject from object. In so doing, all of the information about other or \"unseen\" realities that has become available to us through anthropology, comparative religion, parapsychology, consciousness research, and various uses of nonordinary states inside and outside the laboratory-to name but a few sources of data-would, of necessity, have to be excluded. This worldview and its accompanying restrictive epistemology would, in short, eliminate human consciousness and experience as legitimate ways of knowing about reality. Of the many responses which were more open to my material, Kathryn Robinson's reaction to Gleick's review (Robinson 1994) was one of the most telling. Addressing the restrictiveness of the worldview that Gleick's assault reflected she wrote, \"scientific discovery is not a matter of jamming data into existing categories\ufffd it's about supporting new ones. It's about admitting how much we don't know-in marked contrast to the hubris of a rationalist such as Gleick, who argues that any phenomenon that's not available to his senses must therefore be a sham. Gleick's arrogance,\" she notes, \"would perhaps approach respectability if there were no mysteries left to science.\" Psychologist William James made the same point a hundred years ago. \"The ideal of every science,\" James wrote, \"is that of a closed and completed system of truth .... Phenomena unclassifiable within a system are therefore paradoxical absurdities and must be held untrue (James 1896).\" As I discuss throughout this book, our knowledge of the abduction phenomenon depends, fundamentally,\u00b7 upon human experience-i.e., the reports of the abductees themselves and the recording, sifting, and evaluating of these reports by the investigator. That is, of necessity, a participatory process in which the person exploring the experiences-in this case myself-must enter fully and empathically into the experiencer's world in order to create the context of trust that will bring forth the relevant information. My reasons for taking these experiences seriously are discussed throughout the book, including Appendix A. They have to do essentially with the consistency of reports conveyed with extreme intensity of feeling by sincere individuals of sound mind in the United States and now, increasingly, from around the world, who may themselves doubt profoundly-or would wish to forget-the reality of what they have undergone. No plausible alternative explanation for the reports of abduction experiences, which are sometimes corroborated by physical evidence, has been discovered. This book provides the most detailed accounts we have to date from people who report abduction experiences. These reports, I xii PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION believe, raise profound questions about how we experience the world around us and the very nature of that world. The information that I obtained during the several years of this investigation has been communicated in case after case with such power and consistency that a body of data formed which seemed to point clearly to the experiential truth of the abduction phenomenon, whatever its ultimate source might prove to be. The fact that what the experiencers are describing simply cannot be possible according to our traditional scientific view would, it seems to me, more sensibly, yes rationally, call for a change in that perspective, an expansion of our notions of reality, rather than the \"jamming\" of \"data into existing categories\" that some critics would have us do. It was in the hope of serving a misunderstood population by making sense of their experiences, and, above all, of provoking my readers to reconsider their views of the universe in which we live, that I undertook to write this book."

        "text_source": "The number of testimonies and the quality of the witnesses keep [the issue of] the phenomenon from being dodged, and aeronautic personnel, and more especially defense personnel, must be sensitized and prepared to deal with the situation. In fact, how can one try to ignore a phenomenon that is manifested by the regular crossing of our air space by moving objects the behavior of which suggests that they are piloted by an intelligent [being]? Can one claim, because this appears to exceed our technical knowledge, that it does not fall within our purview? If we do nothing, the very principle of defense and air intelligence would be called into question. The first sightings made by aviators date back to the beginning of the 40s. Since then, the number of unexplained sightings (after an expert's appraisal: UAP Ds) reported by pilots or [air traffic] controllers has risen to over 500. It should be reiterated that in France this figure is three or four since 1951. It is the responsibility of the Air Force to take into account these phenomena which, until proven otherwise, occur primarily in air space. 11.2 Who is Involved? 11.2.1 Flight Crew The flight crew is naturally involved, particularly the pilots, because whether they are civilian or military, they are in a more advantageous position for making sightings and would be the first affected in the event of an incident (risk of collision, in particular). This is especially true for a combat pilot, because he is trained to constantly monitor the sky and he now has more and more advanced weapons systems capable of detecting faster and faster and smaller and smaller targets at greater and greater distances. The pilot/weapons system pair is now more than ever an excellent sighting instrument and would be our first means of intervention if, by chance, this were to prove necessary. The concerns of a commercial airline pilot are different because, in addition to the fact that he does not have the same equipment, his priority is obviously the safety of his passengers. Although he remains a primary partner in the quest for information, he would be totally powerless in the face of an aggressive stance by a UFO. 11.2.2 [Air Traffic] Controllers The [air traffic] controller is, of course, involved, but depending on whether he is civilian or military, the control equipment at his disposal offer him different options. In both cases, since he is in radio contact with the pilot, it is he who is the first to receive the sighting report from the crew. He must be prepared to note and supplement the sightings transmitted with the clear-headedness that the distance of his position gives him. In regard to radar detection, only the military controller has adequate equipment to detect a flying object that does not follow general air traffic rules. In fact, military air defense radars permit a visual display of the primary detection, as well as a synthetic display used by civilian [air traffic] controllers, to appear on the military controller's radar scope (see Appendix 1). In addition, they are the only ones who are able to obtain an image of craft moving at the supposed speeds of UFOs. Finally, the means to record and reconstruct radar situations on site at the Control and Detection Centers (CDC) enable supplemental investigations to be conducted, if necessary. 11.2.3 Meteorologists Unusual phenomena are often explained by meteorological phenomena. Questions can easily be explained if the specialized departments are informed of the importance of their observations. All military and civilian personnel specializing in meteorology must therefore be able to meet this expectation. 11.2.4 CNES Engineers CNES engineers are the French space specialists. They cannot remain indifferent to UFO phenomena. Knowledge of our universe, observation of the sky, and surveillance of anything that is deployed into the sky naturally makes them just the right people to head up the study of extraterrestrial phenomena. We have described their work above. 11.2.5 Engineers in the Aeronautics Sector Engineers in the aeronautic sector are naturally involved. Their work is presented in the next chapter on scientific and technical implications. 11.3 How Do We Involve Aeronautics [Personnel]? In order for aeronautics personnel, along with their resources, to be involved, we need to know how to interest them and, in order to do this, how to inform them of the phenomenon, to specify what is expected of them, and to define what their reflex responses should be and what course of action they should take. 11.3.1 Informing Personnel Informing amounts, first and foremost, to getting someone to accept the possibility of the presence of extraterrestrial craft in our sky. It is necessary to overcome the fear of ridicule and to admit that, failing certainty, there are strong presumptions based on a list of examples selected from among the testimonies from the aeronautics world. Moreover, it is necessary to reach all generations. Informational conferences can be easily scheduled at aeronautics schools for the young generations (Ecole de l'Air, Ecole Rationale de F Aviation Civile [National Civil Aviation School] (ENAC. Sup'Aero, etc. ), and for the not-so-young, in continuing education courses and, obviously, at the College Interarmees de Defense [Interarmy Defense College] (CID) and IHEDN. SEPRA is already holding conferences at ENAC within the framework of civilian [air traffic] controller training. This practice just needs to be extended to all flight crew training schools, regardless of the specialty being taught. For the generations already on the job, these conferences can easily be offered at the Control and Detection Centers and flight units for military personnel, and, at least for civilian [air traffic] controllers, at the Regional Air Navigation Centers (CNRA). As for commercial flight crews, the airline companies - Air France, in particular - have set up a systematic information sheet for crews that is periodically updated. This information must furthermore be updated on a regular basis in the knowledge that the intended objective is to permit a future witness, whether he plays an active role or is merely an observer, to be fully aware of what course of action to take in the face of the phenomenon sighted. If we want personnel to get involved, it is necessary that they know how to react in real time and what to communicate and to whom, how to take the measures corresponding to the present situation, etc. For this reason, it is advisable to define with them what their reflex responses should be and what course of action they should take. 11.3.2 Reflex Responses In fact, it is necessary to instill in personnel who are brought face to face with the phenomenon what their reflex responses should be, in the knowledge that they may merely be simple observers or, in some cases, have to take concrete measures (for example, at San Carlos de Bariloche, the surprise of the landing strip lights going out in the middle of the UFO incident). It is quite certain that it would be better to be prepared in order to be fully aware of what course of action to take in the face of such an unforeseen and poorly understood event. These reflex responses differ in type depending on whether it is a matter of sighting, recording a testimony, transmitting information collected, or reacting in real time in order to take ad hoc measures in response to the phenomenon. 11.3.3 Course of Action to Take The course of action to take seems to us to be summarized as follows: observe, note the maximum amount of details, take photographs if possible, make a report, allowing the visitors the initiative of possibly making contact, and avoid premature publicity in the media. 11.3 3.1 Objective Observation In the face of an unknown situation, one must be on guard against any instinctive self-defense reaction that could be easily interpreted as a provocation. One must just observe and avoid any initiative aimed at seeking contact. 11.3.3.2 Reporting Once a phenomenon has been sighted, it is advisable to report it in order to alert the other crews, on the one hand, which is what is currently done, and the authorities, on the other hand, through the air [traffic] control chain of command in civilian cases and the air defense chain of command in military cases. 11.3.3.3 Remaining Discrete Vis-a-Vis the Public As a witness to a phenomenon of this type, one must know how to adopt a certain level of discretion vis-a-vis the press. It is essential to allow scientists [time] to make use of the information before letting the media trigger the curiosity of the general public, which could result in the disappearance of important evidence."

        "text_source": "Even when active experimentation in the laboratory is precluded, as in astronomy, the astronomer can still 'extract the signal from the noise' by the use of special instrumentation when the phenomenon (such as an eclipse) becomes available to him. Relationships between certain parameters associated with the phenomenon thus become apparent, and further testing and experimentation can then establish them beyond all reasonable doubt. They become a 'scientific fact'. If it were not possible to operate in the above fashion, science would be immensely more difficult; it would be virtually impossible to extract and separate the fundamental elements inherent in the phenomenon from the host of irrelevant and coincidental things always present in an observed situation. This is the situation in the case of die UFOs, which are totally beyond experimental control. Moreover, they are transient, unscheduled, and obtrude upon an observer who is often not competent to make a dispassionate analysis of the totally unexpected and surprising situation. Consequentiy, the significant features of the phenomenon may be buried among incidental - but much more conspicuous - features emphasized in the reports. UFOs, however, are not alone in this category; they share these particular difficulties with many other phenomena, such as ball lightning and meteorites, for which one must rely on the fortuitous observations of the layman for one's data. That is why subjects such as these gained scientific respectability so slowly, particularly when an explanation was hard to find because the phenomenon did not fit the scientific framework of the moment. We may even have to face the fact that the scientific framework, by its very internal logic, excludes certain classes of phenomena, of which UFOs may be one. One of the most exasperating and even repugnant features of the subject is its apparent irrationality. However, as our concept of rationality is a by-product of the scientifically oriented society in which we live, it should not surprise us if a phenomenon that is inaccessible to scientific procedure appears irrational. It is just here that we encounter a second difficulty of the UFO problem. It cannot, at least at present, be separated from the social condition in which it is embedded. We are accustomed to the almost complete isolation of the behavioral sciences from the physical sciences, yet in this problem we have a situation in which the two are inextricably mixed. Whether or not separate, nontrivial physical and behavioral components will emerge as serious study by both disciplines remains to be seen, but it would be premature to reduce the importance of either. Of course, this discussion would be unnecessary if an obvious explanation of UFOs was at hand. In one's frustration it is all too easy to seize on an explanation of the 'men from Mars' variety and to ignore the many UFO features unaccounted for. But to do this is to fall into the very trap we have just discussed. We may be inadvertently and artificially increasing the significance of the conspicuous features while the part we ignore - or that which is not reported by the untrained witnesses - may contain the clue to the whole subject. What needs to be explained has been amply outlined in the descriptions of the six basic UFO observational prototypes given in Chapters Six through Eleven. The most persistent and enigmatic features seem to be the localization of the phenomenon in space and time, its apparently intelligent characteristics (of a rather puerile kind), its appearance of operating outside the established laws of physics, and its peculiar preferences for certain situations. The frequently reported presence of 'humanoids' capable of moving about in comfort in our highly restrictive terrestrial environment, and their association with 'craft', exhibiting at times near-zero inertial mass yet able to leave physical traces of their presence, is surely a phenomenon beyond the pale of mid-twentieth century physics. But there will surely be, we hope, a twenty-first century science and a thirtieth century science, and perhaps they will encompass the UFO phenomenon as twentieth century science has encompassed the aurora borealis, a feat unimaginable to nineteenth century science, which likewise was incapable of explaining how the sun and stars shine. We work in the brilliant spotlight of the present, only dimly conscious of the penumbra of the past and quite unable to illuminate the darkness of the future. Let us imagine for a moment a covered wagon train of not much more than a century ago, winding its long journey to the west. It is encamped for the night, its wagons in a circle, sentries posted, and the travelers gathered about a campfire for warmth and cheer. Someone speaks of the future, but he speaks, as he must, with the words and concepts of his day. But even were he inspired by some kindly muse of the future to speak of making their entire journey in a matter of hours, flying through the air, and of watching scenes by television and hearing voices speaking on another continent, this gifted one could not have put into words a glimmer of how these wondrous things might be accomplished. The vocabulary for such descriptions - electrons, transistors, integrated circuits, jet engines - the jargon vehicle of technical communications would not yet exist for yet a century. He would be helplessly incoherent for want of words as vehicles for his thoughts. Would one care to venture a guess at the technical vocabulary of the year 373,475 (assuming intelligent life still exists on earth) and to predict the concepts and knowledge for which it will be a vehicle? Does such an advanced knowledge and technology already exist somewhere in space? The sun, our parent star, is but one star out of billions in our galaxy, and our galaxy is but one of many millions, each with its billions of stars. It is statistically improbable that our sun is the only star out of quadrillions of stars to have planets. That would be somewhat like claiming that acorns can be found lying near only one oak tree in the world. Even if we limit our thinking to the billions of stars in our galaxy alone, we know that our galaxy was in existence for billions of years before our sun appeared. Thus the stage was set long ago for this possibility, the possibility of civilizations as greatly advanced beyond us as we are beyond mice. For instance, Fred Hoyle1 has conjectured that it is possible that a great intragalactic communications network exists but that we are like a settler in the wilderness who as yet has no telephone. Such ideas, once forbidding and even revolting to our geo centric minds, no longer shock us as we slowly grow out of ou cosmic provincialism. Such concepts, however, have little to da directly with our problem at the moment save that they presenl one possible hypothesis for study. But talk of extraterrestria visitors or the more esoteric notions of time travel or of parallel universes is as inappropriate as the mass hallucination hypothesis for UFOs at this stage. Kuhn has commented that] scientific progress tends to be revolutionary rather than evol-j utionary, and the above concepts are, despite their bizarre nature, merely imaginative extensions of current concepts. When the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, I believe that it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science but a mighty and totally unexpected quantum jump.

        "text_source": " Admiral of the Fleet  The Lord Hill-Norton GCB  Chief of the Defence Staff 1971\u20133  Chairman of the NATO Military Committee 1974\u20137  I have known Tim Good for about 20 years and have been in close touch with him for all that long time, during which I have written a Foreword for two of his books and a Commentary on a couple of others. It is a pleasure for me to have been asked to do it again, for I have the highest regard for his absolute integrity,  his  determination  and  skill  as  a  researcher,  and  his  wide  and detailed knowledge of the whole fascinating UFO experience. Were this not so, I confess at once that I should have serious difficulty in accepting several passages in this riveting book and the astounding revelations he now shares with  the  public. Foremost  among  these,  perhaps,  are  his  reports  on widespread alien bases, including some undersea and their craft (USOs), and the possibility that the occupants have been collaborating with the Americans in the transfer of technology. In this new work the author starts from the premise that there can no longer be  any  serious  doubt  that  extraterrestrials  have  been  visiting  our  planet  for many years. He deals here with their activities, rather than with speculation about  the  craft  in  which  they  travel. We  learn  in  his  Introduction  that  the French Institute of Higher Studies for National Defence reported last year to their President and Prime Minister that 'the physical reality of UFOs under the  control  of  intelligent  beings  is  now  almost certain'  and,  as  I  have  said publicly elsewhere, I share that view. Indeed, it seems to me that the position of  even  a  few  years  ago  is  now  reversed  and  that  anyone  who  does  not believe it should be required to prove why they do not, rather than the other way round. Good cites the 'giggle factor' in his Introduction to describe the reaction of people,  who  should  know  better,  to  disclosures  about  UFOs  and  their occupants,  and  their  origin,  behaviour  and  purpose. Such  expressions  are  unfortunately commonplace and most usually appear in the writings of lazy second-rate journalists. Many share their views or, perhaps more accurately, say that they do. This reaction can only be driven by fear or ignorance and, as far as scientists are concerned, what they fear most is an attack on their own discipline; they fear their ignorance being exposed to public derision and they actually fear their inability to cope with what Good and all serious ufologists assert is the reality. As for the 'journos', they have found that it is easier to write a knocking piece about what I have called the 'little green men ha-haha ' syndrome than it would be to do some quite difficult but elementary work on analysing books such as this one. I have laboured this point because I believe it is important, particularly to new readers of the genre, to start with the notion that this is not a work of fiction; it is a carefully considered report by a distinguished and experienced researcher. Let  me  go  over  to  the  attack  \u2013  UFO  protagonists  now  have  no need to be defensive, if they ever had. So if after reading Chapters 8\u201313 you still  do  not  believe  that  there  was  a  creature  of  Pretare,  try  answering  the  Anyone  who  reads  these  words  will  very  soon  realize  that  they  must disregard  this  foolish  and  superficial  view  of  UFOs,  and  their  occupants, called  for  convenience  'aliens'. Tim  Good  refers  in  his  Introduction  to  the sensible,  proper  and  highly  satisfactory  way  in  which  this  whole  important subject is treated in China. How much better it would be for all of us if our scientific community and the media would give it the same treatment. Discerning readers will find here a wealth of material upon which they can make up their own minds. I would suggest that before doing so they should try  to  imagine  what  their  grandparents,  perhaps  even  their  parents,  would have made in the 1920s, even in the 1950s, of the idea that men would shortly be walking on the Moon, that space probes would arrive at the precise time forecast years before on Jupiter or Saturn or Mars, and send back precise and detailed information, that instant communication by voice or image from one spot on the globe to any other would be just routine, that human hearts can be successfully  transplanted,  babies  conceived  in  a  test  tube  and  that  all  this would be commonplace in 2000. They would have found such happenings as bizarre,  fanciful  and  incredible  as  some  of  the  matters  which  have  been reported all over the world to Good by reliable and corroborated witnesses, such as Rubens Villela, a distinguished scientist who has worked for the CIA as well as the US and Brazilian navies. following questions: Why on earth should Caponi make up such an unlikely tale? How,  if  he  made  it  up,  did  a  young  unsophisticated  artisan  from  a remote Italian village manage to convince such an experienced, hard-headed researcher as Good? Why was a hostile Carabinieri unable to break his story or  to  discredit  his  photographs? Why  did  the  US  Embassy  in  Rome  try  to steal the photographs? If, after reading Chapters 2, 16 and 17, you still do not believe that there is something very odd going on in Puerto Rico, then you have  brought  scepticism  to  an  art  form. Why  does  almost  the  entire population believe in the existence of the so-called chupacabras? Why does the US military deny access to part of the island which is reported to contain an alien base and is sometimes guarded by armed sentries? These and many more strange stories from the island have been checked out with the author by Graham Sheppard, a recently retired British Airways captain, who relates in Chapter 2 a remarkable experience he had there himself, not far from an area where two other pilots simply disappeared some years before. He and his aircraft flying there in good weather inexplicably suffered what he describes as 'an enormous lateral displacement', which took him miles off his course and nearly into a forbidden zone. Is it likely that a man whose very career depends on his airmanship and total integrity would make up such a yarn? All these, and many other astonishing and well-documented experiences, await you in this remarkable book. It will appeal, I have no doubt, to the new explorer in this strange territory as well as to the regular UFO buff. Readers of  either  persuasion  cannot  fail  to  be  impressed  \u2013  as  I  was  \u2013  that  many incidents  reported  by  the  author  are  corroborated  by  more  than  one independent  witness,  frequently  a  member  of  the  police,  or  the  military, whose  integrity  there  can  be  no  reason  to  doubt. Good  has  given  me  in confidence the names of many of his sources who do not at present wish to be identified,  and  I  can  vouch  for  their  record  of  probity  and  good  standing, frequently  in  government  service. This  alone  makes  Unearthly  Disclosure worthy of serious attention and allows me to recommend it with confidence. It is a first-class read and an important contribution to the UFO lexicon."

        "text_source": "It is possible that the aliens will, in the end, help humankind and the world. Their intervention in the rush of human events might be a positive step toward solving the problems of disease, the environment, and war. However, at this time the evidence of benevolent intentions is, at best, ambiguous. One thing is certain: Most abductees say the phenomenon has had a devastating effect on their personal lives. Many have phobias, scars, bruises, and physical problems, especially gynecological and urological dysfunction. Many live in fear that it will happen again and feel guilty that they cannot protect their children. The debate over alien intentions again brings up the question of what is believable in abduction research. Hypnosis, consciously recalled memories, false memories-is there a way of separating the \"signal from the noise\"? Uncovering the reality of abduction events is difficult but feasible. Methodological rigor has developed a core of solid information, confirmed by hundreds of abductees, and it has enabled investigators to understand the abduction phenomenon. Alien intentions, an area that could not be addressed from an evidentiary standpoint in the past, depends on the aliens' ultimate goals. Their intentions are linked to the end of their program and can be narrowed down to three possibilities: Their actions are mutually beneficial to both the aliens and humans; they are beneficial to the aliens and intentionally harmful to humans; or they are beneficial to the aliens who simply do not care what human consequences their actions might have. Is there any way to discern what the outcome will be? Our present state of knowledge has finally allowed us to understand what most probably will happen in the future when the aliens' goals and intentions will be made evident. We do not yet have all the pieces to the puzzle but the outlines are well-defined and the picture is clearly recognizable. It is not a picture that I enjoy looking at."

        "text_source": "Researcher Richard Hall has said that we have two possibilities of obtaining meaningful answers to the UFO dilemma: one; if science and government wake up and begin to support its thorough investigation; and two; if the aliens decide to communicate their intent to us and make their presence undeniable. But, unfortunately, none of the parties involved seem very partial to either of these possibilities. One would think that the implications of the UFO mystery-which include the possible end of human culture and existence as we know it-would evoke a terrible outcry, a groundswell of demands to look into these reports. But this is not happening, especially at the governmental and scientific levels, where scorn and disavowal of interest in the subject prevail. We believe this is due less to concern about the potential danger of covert extraterrestrial presence than to the widespread tenet in the realms of government, science, and the media that it is just not possible. As for the aliens, rather than the proverbial broadcast from the White House lawn, the aliens seem quite content with their program of secrecy. And why not? Whatever their ultimate purpose, they are able to dip in and out of our world with impunity. They don't have to tell us what they are doing, because-to the best of our knowledge-no government, no power on earth is holding them accountable. In Sight Unseen, my wife, writer and filmmaker Carol Rainey, and I propose to look directly at the question of what is possible-and what is not-in the so-called impossible UFO phenomenon. For instance, how can a flying disc fifty feet in diameter simply vanish? Is it feasible that two little girls in a major city could be abducted from their cellar playroom in broad daylight with no one seeing it happen? Or, if nature has established a powerful barrier against interspecies breeding, how could we be receiving so many reports of human-alien hybrids? How could a car, a cow, or even a person, levitate up a beam of light? Is there any credibility to abductee reports of having their behavior and emotions controlled by the UFO occupants? Is there any concrete science that we can refer to in exploring these seemingly paranormal events? We believe that by looking at some fascinating theoretical twists and turns as well as several quite bizarre discoveries in modern science, particularly in the field of physics, we can show how UFOs and their occupants may actually obey, not defy, the laws of physics and the natural sciences. We will demonstrate, once and for all, how phenomena conventionally thought to be impossible might actually be occurring now, presently, in our lifetime. But while we may find intriguing analogies between the mysteries of the UFO phenomenon and the kaleidoscopic new findings in biotechnology, neurophysiology, and quantum physics, we'll resist the temptation to assume that likeness constitutes proof of the existence of radical UFO technology. For several reasons, applying scientific principles to UFO research through the time-honored methods of science has always been a problematic undertaking. Most often the researcher is not a direct observer of the UFO event or abduction and instead has to depend on the testimony of credible witnesses-on secondhand observations. However, as we have seen, specific details, reported over and over by individuals from different countries, ages, and backgrounds, form distinct and compelling patterns, and it is by thorough examination of those patterns that our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon advances. Furthermore, we believe that both our current and emerging scientific ideas will shed light on the UFO mystery, and light is what will ultimately give the UFO phenomenon plausibility and corporeal reality in the doubting eyes of the world. In the following chapters, we will explore several newly isolated abduction patterns that are both extraordinary and deeply unsettling. The consistencies of these cases form perhaps the most radical and disturbing aspects of the UFO phenomenon yet to be openly discussed. We don't yet fully understand these events, nor are we able to prove their occurrence in the usual scientific manner. However, these events can newly inform a dialogue between abduction data and our earthly science's fresh gleanings about the nature of reality. It is in this exchange between the elusive mystery of UFOs and, for instance, the eerie world of quantum particles that some common language may be found."

        "text_source": "Moreover, the track record of channelers fails to inspire confidence. Believing the claims of all of their contradictory and often mutually exclusive predictions would leave one extremely confused, to say the least. The memory of the failed 2012 Ascension predictions by many channelers and psychics also left a bad taste. Finally, insights or wisdom provided by a channeler is one thing; concluding therefore that they must be accurate when claiming it comes from an extraterrestrial being is quite another. New Age Aliens   Channeling extraterrestrials goes right to the beginning of the modern UFO phenomenon. As early as 1952, a contactee named George Van Tassell claimed to be in telepathic communication with extraterrestrials. He made no paranormal claims, but stated that they used advanced technology to connect with natural human abilities. The name of the being who contacted him, he said, was named Ashtar. Ashtar's earliest messages focused on the dangers from nuclear weapons. They also described an extraterrestrial government that monitored Earth and wanted to improve life for humanity. This was the origin of the idea of Ashtar Command  Soon, Ashtar Command was being channeled by others. The messages did not always agree, and rivalries developed. Many predictions followed, often centering on the imminent arrival of an Ashtar-led armada to guide and protect mankind. During the 1970s, a person known as Tuella began channeling Ashtar Command. Rather than emphasize technology or politics, she focused on inner spiritual development and achieving higher dimensions. This, of course, coincided with the beginnings of the modern New Age movement. Other Ashtar channelers continued to emphasize apocalyptic themes, even stating that Ashtar Command's ships would soon arrive to help people evacuate the planet. One such channeler predicted this would happen in 1994. The Internet gave Ashtar Command a new life. It appears that no matter how many failed predictions exist in one's track record, there are always people who will find a way to believe the next one. Today, after more than half a century of existence, Ashtar Command (now known as Ashtar Galactic Command) seems to work as a kind of committee that keeps control over its messages. Apocalypses are definitely out. But Ashtar Command is just one small part of the modern channeling of alleged extraterrestrials, which exploded into ufology during the 1980s. Barbara Marciniak, for example, began channeling the Pleiadians at that time and gained an influence that is difficult to overstate. [325] Her sessions provided a virtually complete statement of modern New Age philosophy. She was not the first channeler to give such messages, but she was the first popular channeler who explicitly communicated with extraterrestrials and incorporated such a philosophy. Earlier channelers, such as J. Z. Knight, the channeler of Ramtha, essentially offered the same ideas, but Ramtha is Lemurian, not extraterrestrial. And what is that message? In the case of the Pleiadians, they speak to Marciniak from the future. They claim to be one of many extraterrestrial life forms interacting with Earth, not all of which are benevolent. They claim that Earth will experience a major event, beginning in 2012, during which the battle for dominion of our world will take place. Indeed, the original prediction was not for 2012. When it was in made in the early 1990s, it was set for the year 2000. Now that the 2012 prediction seems to have failed, too, perhaps a new date will be set. Or, perhaps it has happened on schedule, since most of us cannot perceive this battle, which is said to occur in the fourth and fifth dimensions, and most of humanity perceives only three dimensions. According to Marciniak's sources, this is because 300,000 years ago, in an earlier struggle for Earth, human DNA was disassembled by malevolent beings from twelve strands to a double helix structure. These beings wanted to keep humanity ignorant so as to feed from our fear, anger, and doubt. The fundamental message is that Reptilians are really in charge of this planet and keep humanity for their own sustenance. In this context, the Pleiadian message via Marciniak is to remind humanity of its divine origins, to trigger its DNA reconstruction, to help people re-assimilate light into their bodies, and raise their frequency. All of this will enable them to travel in higher dimensions and survive the coming upheaval. This is the core of what has been called the Ascension process."

        "text_source": "THE SURVIVORS  During this same lengthy communication in April 1954, Alan described what had happened to the survivors of the devastating conflict that had destroyed an entire civilization tens of thousands of years ago. On a high plateau in what is now Tibet, six of the surviving aerial craft were landed by their crews, to determine the fate of the survivors:  It was suggested that an attempt be made to reach another planet. The aerial craft then in use were capable of traveling in space, and had frequently been used to reach elevations of hundreds of miles, but no attempt had yet been made to leap the vast gulf between the planets, and the crew members were far from certain that such an attempt could succeed. The planet which you now know as Mars was then in conjunction with the Earth, and preliminary estimates seemed to indicate that the crossing could be made. At that time, the surface conditions of temperature, atmosphere, water, etc. were somewhat better suited for human survival than the conditions your astronomers report to exist today. A vote was taken, and the members of the crews of four of the craft elected to take the huge gamble in the hope of preserving, thereby, at least a portion of the culture of the race. The remaining crews decided to remain on Earth. They believed that, because of the elevation of the plateau on which they were gathered, and the relatively low level of radiation at that point, they could continue to live in this area without suffering complete physical or mental degeneration in themselves or their descendants. I can see the question forming in your mind, so I will explain that this race had achieved perfect equality of the sexes, and both were equally represented in this council, and in the crews of the ships. Of the four craft which essayed the great leap, three arrived safely at their destination. There is no record in our history as to the fate of the fourth. For many generations the grim struggle for survival demanded the entire time and energy of the people ... As the battle for survival against the harsh environment was gradually won, the development of the material science resumed its normal pattern, and technology spurted ahead. With the lessons of the past constantly before the people, however, the material values were carefully maintained in their proper relationship to the social and spiritual values. 'The greatest need of your race, your civilization and your society today,' concluded Alan, 'is simple, basic understanding between man and his fellow man, between nation and nation, and between all men and that greater power and intelligence that pervades and controls all nature. Understanding is the key to survival for your race . . . l  DISCUSSION  Was Dan Fry really taken for a ride - or was he taking us for a ride? I have dwelled at length on his story for two reasons: first, because I believe it to be fundamental to the understanding of certain extraterrestrial encounters; secondly, because I believe the story to be essentially true. That is not to say that I accept it unreservedly. There are a number of Fry's claims that require critical commentary."

        "text_source": "IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN IDENTITY Each abductee experiences in some sense an expansion of his or her sense of self, of identity in the world. Paul wondered how we had come to mistake the \"shell\" of our being for the \"whole\" of it; and Eva, in her recall of the Soul Bird story of her childhood, recognized there were compartments of self which she was opening up and merging in order to move from fragmentation toward wholeness. The change that abductees experience is fundamentally that they may no longer feel themselves to be separate from other beings. They shed their identification with a narrow social role and gain a sense of oneness with all creation, a kind of universal connectedness. This opening to a wider identity appears to be a direct result of the abduction experiences, if not a central aspect of the whole process. The change appears to be the result of two related elements. The abduction experiences themselves shatter the illusion of our control, and demonstrate forcefully \ufffdhat we are helpless in the face of forces and beings whose purpose we do not understand. Each abductee discovers that he or she is but one intelligent being in a universe populated with various other entities that are not \"supposed to\" exist. Human beings are not lords of the earth, they realize, but children of the cosmos who must find their way to live in harmony with all manner of creatures on the earth and elsewhere. This is a terrifying lesson in humility that opens the psyche to a wider perception of the universe, including the beings and entities that inhabit it. At the same time, as I noted, some abductees become open to the presence of a divine source, which fills their being and gives a sense of connection with a universal consciousness from which they have come and to which they will return. \"Past life\" experiences, which seem to extend the sense of self over time in both embodied and unembodied form, create a further expansion of the feeling of what it is to be a human being. Finally, the peculiar sense that many abductees gain during the relaxation sessions that they have a dual huf!lan/alien identity reinforces all of the above processes . For the alien self is felt to be a kind of missing part, a soul link to the universal source of consciousness, the anima mundi from which they feel they have been cut off.PoLITICAL, EcoNOMIC, AND RELIGious IMPLICATIONS The Western scientific/materialist worldview has been hugely successful in its explorations of the physical world, revealing many of its secrets and using this knowledge to serve human purposes. We have overcome the harshness of winter, reduced suffering through advances in medicine, and learned to communicate electronically with those who are far away. At the same time we have applied our knowledge to creating weapons of destruction that can now easily destroy life as we know it. Our use of modern technology to tear resources from the earth is bringing the biosphere to the brink of collapse. We are a species out of harmony with nature, gone berserk in the indulgence of its desires at the expense of other living beings and the earth that has given us life. The task of reversing this trend is momentous. Even as we recognize the peril we have created, the vested interests that stand in the way of discovering a balance in our relationship with nature are formidable. Huge \u00b7corporate, scientific, educational, and military institutions consume many billions of dollars of material goods and maintain, as if mindlessly, a paralyzing stasis that is difficult to reverse. For international business the world seems at times to be nothing more than a giant market to be divided up among the cleverest entrepreneurs."

        "text_source": "Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people from around the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs and philosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generational divides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as to priorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized many people around the world into permanent suspicion against global political elites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is our technology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply getting access to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced. Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filed online every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance are hundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there are thousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered and overwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incredible field. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history of UFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspect of the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Trying to make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone's pet project for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has been heating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are on the brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

They, and the birds and the bees seem to survive more because of sophisticated instinct than logic. Fred Hoyle, a brilliant cosmologist, once wrote a science fiction book called The Black Cloud4 which described the psychic attack on Earth of a cloud of particles (each of no consequence by itself) dooming Earth. Since some alleged aliens have been reported as having psychic abilities, it is conceivable that they might be able to do all this logic and mathematics psychically, thereby suggesting lack of a logical thought process. However, I would argue that the logic and math exists in their society even though they may not put it on paper. For example, the process of remote viewing has been enhanced by a logical treatment of the procedures, and random number generators are yielding a wealth of impressive data in both time and space. Therefore, in discussing alien societies and motives, I'm going to assume that it is reasonable to assess their motives, means and opportunity on a logical basis, and that they have access to no different set of equations or physics or biology than we do. If their society is older, they could logically be able to understand our universe more clearly with even better concept and attendant equations than we have. In summary, my perspective is that it is logical to assume that the laws of nature apply equally everywhere. Alien diseases and the science fiction classics  The public, the government, and the media have all been influenced by two powerful stories, both made into movies, and they have affected how we potentially view alien creatures. The first one, the famous War of the Worlds6 by H. G. Wells, has been made into at least one famous radio broadcast7 and two movies. Here the invading Martian aliens (big, destructive, seemingly mechanical) attempt to kill everyone in sight until at the end they die, killed by one of our own infections. In the second classic story, The Andromeda Strain8, an exploratory craft is brought back to earth ahead of schedule for classified reasons, and crashes in a rural area, and those who investigate, including the town's doctor, are killed by a deadly pathogen, which turns out to be classified as a virus having a fascinating structure and mechanism of action. We have been preparing for this event for decades, so with multi-levels of biologic security at the disease control center, and by clever reasoning, we are able to defeat the disease just before it kills everyone in the story, and subsequently, the earth's population. This too has been made into a movie very effectively.9 In Chapter 17, you will read about how there was unusual interest in this story by our biological warfare folks. These stories have major significance towards the perception of UFOs by the Government and by the public. The War of the Worlds left the impression, partly because of media hype, that millions of people were panicked by the potential threat of aliens. Actually, according to historians, two people died, one from a heart attack and one from running a red light.10 Those who were upset were limited to those who were near the alleged landing locations of the aliens. Nevertheless, the image stuck: aliens will cause panic if they are here. This assumption, in my opinion, significantly influenced governments to suppress the genuine potential extraterrestrial sightings and indeed - the early indications that we thought they were extraterrestrial.11 Therefore, avoiding panic became one of the centerpieces of policy for UFO management by the U.S."

        "text_source": "I will briefly outline the types of experiences that could be placed in this category. Of overriding importance is the shift that needs to occur in the relationship between the experiencer and the alien beings before consciousness-altering information can be received. Although the relationship with the aliens may have been playful, even intimate, in early childhood, it tends to change to a more disturbing and traumatic one as puberty approaches and the reproductive hybrid \"project\" begins. As traumatic intrusions take place, the abductees tend to feel themselves to be victims of hostile beings who regard them coldly, or simply as specimens in a project that serves the needs of the aliens. They may feel betrayed by the alien beings as the nature of their interaction changes. But as our work deepens, especially as the power of this extraordinary alien encounter is acknowledged and the abductees come to accept their lack of control of the process, the frightening and adversarial quality of the relationship seems to give way to a more reciprocal one in which more mutual human-alien communication can take place. The abductees may even experience a profound love for the alien beings-in some ways more powerful than the love they experience in human relationships-and may feel that this love is returned. Connection through the eyes seems to play an important part in the evolution of this process. Whereas, for example, the abductees felt bitterly resentful about having their sperm and eggs used by the aliens in the hybridization project, they may come to feel that they are participating in a process that has value for the creation and evolution of life. There are those who might argue that such a shift in stance by the abductees in the face of the ongoing helplessness of the abduction situation is in fact a defensive shift, even self-delusion in the service of mitigating pain and distress. It could be considered an attempt by the ego to retain a sense of mastery by giving away voluntarily what will be taken by force, or an attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance by believing that the emotional cost of such a traumatic experience can be balanced by providing something good and positive for the universe. On the other hand, it is possible that working through the shattering experience of the abduction may give abductees access to experiences of transpersonal meaning, universal love, and connectedness that make such compassion possible. \u00b7 As is true of so many aspects of the abduction phenomenon, it is difficult in the area of transformational or spiritual growth- related experiences to separate cause and effect, or even to think in causal terms at all. Does an abductee, for example, receive (and communicate) information about a past life experience because his consciousness is open to the possibility of such matters? Or will the emergence into consciousness of the memory of a past life, itself facilitated by our work together, bring about an expanded personal horizon and a broadening of the sense of self in relation to the larger fabric of universal consciousness? The fact that the relationship between the abductees and the aliens can evolve so dramatically over time makes me question categorizations of the beings into constructive, good, and loving ones and others that are deceptive and hostile, bent on taking over our planet-the idea that the light beings are good or caring, for example; the grays are businesslike and indifferent. This kind of taxonomy smacks suspiciously of the sorts of polarization that characterizes human group or ethnonational relationships and could have little to do with the way interspecies or interdimensional relationships, if their actuality were to become established, might work beyond the earth. Furthermore, it is common for abductees to experience, for example, both light beings and little grays (Arthur, chapter 15) or reptilian and other sorts of beings (Carlos, chapter 14 ), during the same abduction. It is possible that we are dealing with relationship processes that are evolutionary in nature and not comprehensible in the linear terms of our familiar polarities. Types of experience during abductions that appear to be related to personal growth and transformation are as follows: 1. \"Pushing through\" occurs, i.e., fully experiencing the terror and rage associated with the helplessness and intrusive instrumentation on the ships. When this takes place acknowledgment and acceptance of the power of the experiences becomes possible and a more reciprocal relationship follows in which personal growth and learning can take place. From the \"ego death\" follow other levels of transformation: 2. The aliens may be perceived as intermediaries or intermediate entities between the fully embodied state of human beings and the primal source of creation or \"God\" (in the sense of a cosmic consciousness, rather than a personified being). In this regard abductees sometimes liken the alien beings to angels, or other \"light beings\" (including the \"grays\"). 3. The abductees may actually experience themselves as returning to their cosmic source or \"Home,\" an inexpressibly beautiful realm beyond, or not in, space/time as we know it. When this occurs during a hypnosis session, powerful, inexpressibly joyous, even orgiastic feeling occurs. Conversely, abductees may weep with sadness when they experience having to leave their cosmic home, return to Earth and become embodied once again. 4. \"Past lives\" are experienced during the sessions with strong emotion appropriate to what material is emerging. This is most likely to occur when the investigator picks up on cues in the sessions during which encounters from infancy are being reexperienced. Complaints or simply observations of being here on Earth \"again,\" of being \"back\" or having \"returned\" are voiced (about which I then inquire). The \"past lives\" that emerge seem to have relevance to the personal development or evolution of the experiencer, as I have seen in the cases of Dave and Joe. 5. Past life experiences provide abductees (and the investigator) with a different perspective about time and the nature of human identity. Cycles of birth and death over long stretches of time can thus be relived, providing a different, less ego derived sense of the continuity of life and the smallness of an individual lifetime from a cosmic perspective. Consciousness is experienced as not coterminous with the body; the notion of a soul with an existence separate from the body becomes relevant. 6. Once the separateness of consciousness from the body is grasped, other kinds of \"transpersonal\" experiences become possible; identification of consciousness with virtually endless kinds of beings and entities through space/time and beyond often occurs. Paul (chapter 10), among my cases for example, found himself during our sessions identified with dinosaurs or dinosaur-like reptiles from another era and experienced himself present at the site of a UFO crash several decades ago when alien beings were destroyed by human fear and aggression. Another abductee, a young Brazilian man, found that his alien encounters opened him to the identification with the myths and spirit entities of his culture's folklore, from which his Western scientific and intellectual training had cut him off. 7. A distinct but important aspect of this kind of transpersonal experience is an abductee 's sense of possessing a double human/alien identity. In their alien selves they may discover themselves doing many of the things that the \"other\" aliens have done to them and to other human beings, such as studying their minds or even carrying out reproductive procedures. The alien identity seems to be connected in some way with the soul of the human self, and one of the tasks the abductee then confronts is the integration of their human and alien selves, which takes on the character of a reensoulment of their humanity. 8. The reliving of abduction material leads abductees to open to other realities beyond space/time, realms that are variously described as beyond a \"veil\" or some other barrier which has kept them in a \"box\" or in a consciousness limited to the physical world. When asked about these experiences abductees have trouble finding the words to describe what has occurred and speak of the \"collapse\" of space/time, of the nonrelevance of the notions of space and time, and of being in multiple times and places at the same moment. The result of all these experiences for abductees is the discovery of a new and altered sense of their place in the cosmic design, one that is more modest, respectful, and harmonious in relation to the earth and its living systems. Emotions of awe, respect for the mystery of nature, and a heightened sense of the sacredness of the natural world are experienced along with deep sadness about the apparent hopelessness of Earth's environmental crisis. One of John Carpenter's cases described herself as having become a \"child of the universe\" after she had become conscious of her abduction experiences. The meaning and implications of these shifts of consciousness for possible human futures will be discussed more fully in the case examples and in the concluding chapter. The thirteen cases presented in this book--eight men and five women-were selected from the seventy-six abductees I have interviewed on the basis of the following criteria: 1. Their stories, although in some instances complex, seemed to me sufficiently clear to permit a coherent narrative."

        "text_source": "Unbelievable as all this sounds to most people, it echoes the basic message of a book first published back in 1955, which has attracted a small but loyal following. The Urantia Book is nearly three thousand pages of an obtuse and overly detailed description of the nature of God and the creation and structure of both Earth and the universe reportedly channeled from a variety of nonhuman entities, including an entity also named Melchizedek. According to The Urantia Book, the original Melchizedek was a direct creation of God who, along with another direct creation, Gabriel, administers our known universe, referred to as Nebadon, which contains ten thousand inhabited systems. Urantia is this book's name for Earth. The book's authors made it clear that sentient life exists both on other physical worlds as well as other dimensions. They also stated that humans are spiritual beings living simultaneous existences on many different levels but that most people have lost this knowledge except in regard to religious matters. We worship God, first, because he is, wrote the authors, then, because he is in us, and last, because we are in him. This book agreed with other researchers in stating that a wide variety of nonhuman life-forms, many of them energy beings, visit and work on the earth for the purpose of assisting in the planet's evolutionary growth toward God. It stated that Lucifer, once a distinguished administrator of God, fell from grace by thinking that his own intellect was the same as God's-the same mistake attributed by others to the grey aliens. The struggle between good and evil on this world is a physical manifestation of the struggle between those beings who chose to follow their own desires and intellect and those who would follow the sum total of creative energy-God. While such words of love and immortality, whether channeled or otherwise, are written off by most people as some sort of New Age balderdash, there is an intriguing consistency to these messages. Whether this is due to some cosmic truth or simply the result of an evolving mythology among writers of such material who read each other and then add their own interpretation, appears a matter of individual belief. What is certain is that once again, the clash of individual mindsets enters the picture, particularly in considering the religious implications of the UFO phenomenon. And while individual belief and faith are matters far beyond the scope of this work, it is instructive to note the various positions advanced by the voices of those speaking for religion. An Alien by Any Other Name   A diminutive being with large, hypnotic eyes is encountered during a walk in the woods. Should he/she/it be regarded as an angel, a devil, an elf, or an alien? It would appear to depend upon the observer's perspective. A pragmatic debunker such as Curtis Peebles would probably deny the whole encounter, chalking it up to some passing psychological anomaly or badly digested food. A peaceful person oriented toward New Age philosophy might believe she had encountered a space brother working for man's enlightenment. A person with a mythical bent might believe he had met an elf or wood faerie. For the suspicious fundamentalist, fearful of damnation and the erosion of his tightly constructed world, it would be a disciple of the devil. For the more positive-thinking religious person, the figure would be an angel. After all, there are currently numerous books, records, and videos concerned with angels. In fact, there's almost a whole subculture of those intrigued by angels. How are we expected to determine whether a manifestation is an angel, devil, or alien? Authors Pacheco and Blann concluded that since deceit and misrepresentation are so prevalent in the UFO field, entities relating with humans must be evil. As difficult as it may be to accept in our materialistic society, the real answer behind the paranormal might not lie in science, but in the occult, they wrote. Stating that society's attempts to separate the physical from the spiritual are doomed to failure, they said, Discussion of metaphysical entities such as 'angels' or 'demons' infer the existence of a moral code which our society is gradually jettisoning. If instead of 'angels and demons' we used such words as 'Jungian archetypes' or 'interdimensional realities' then this would be more acceptable, since it would not imply a conflict of 'good versus evil' and certainly would not suggest the existence of either a God or Satan. Similar arguments have been raised by researchers who point to the reported behavior of aliens, particularly those blamed for abductions. They intrude into people's homes, incapacitate their victims, take them by force, and then subject them to unwanted and frightening medical examinations and procedures. Many people ask how anyone could call such behavior benevolent. Others argue that it could well be a situation comparable to a small child being grabbed up and taken to a hospital, where efficient medical personnel operate on her in a coolly professional manner. The child is terrified and does not understand what is happening, while the ones operating treat her as a patient to be processed. Such an attitude, born of repetition and weariness, can be found in emergency rooms all over the country. Pacheco and Blann claimed that due to the combination of widespread paranormal phenomena with current geophysical and political events, mankind must be entering the biblical end times: Perhaps not the 'end of the world' in a physical sense, but at least the end of the current phase of human existence. They went on to conclude that our society is in the midst of a concerted campaign of deception being promoted by certain individuals who are themselves under deception by 'consciousness' that inhabits the twilight world between the real and the surreal-similar to what Carl Jung called 'archetypes of a collective consciousness,' and what religions call angelic beings. In other words, we are all involved in the age-old battle between good and evil, God versus Satan."

        "text_source": "Impact on Society  Opinion is divided on the vital question of humankind's ability to accept the reality of space visitors and get on with life without severe disruption of society. However, different assumptions can lead to different conclusions. If the visitors did not \"take over\" (in the sense of conquest and domination) and maintained a relatively low profile, their presence probably would not be severely disruptive. It all depends on \"what these guys want\" and what kind of relationship they want with us. Are they benign visitors who are merely curious and wish to communicate with us, or are they intrusive would-be residents or overlords who have their own agenda that conflicts with our own? An early scholarly opinion about what it all might mean was expressed by Yale University social scientist, Dr. Harold D. Lasswell: \"The implications of the unidentified flying objects (UFO) may be that we are already viewed with suspicion by more advanced civilizations and that our attempts to gain a foothold elsewhere [through space travel) may be rebuffed as a threat to other systems of public order. \"\u2022 The eminent psychologist and philosopher Carl G. Jung wrote fairly extensively about UFOs, including a book and letters to various UFO researchers, among them the author.' In regard to potential panic, he wrote (circa 1958), \"One does not faint with regard to the H-bomb.\" His implication was that at that time we were living with the reality of H-bombs over our heads, and we did not cower in fear or panic (although we did build bomb shelters). Yet, about a year later he wrote: \"[If UFOs should prove to be space visitors) we would find ourselves in the same critical position as primitive societies confronted with the superior culture of the white man. The reins of power would be taken from our hands .... Our spiritual progress would be hopelessly anticipated, and consequently paralyzed. And of course our science would immediately have to be put in the attic. \" A Brookings Institution report prepared for NASA and issued in December 1960, recommended that the world prepare itself for contact with extraterrestrial life. Such a discovery, author Donald N. Michael suggested, could stimulate an all-out effort to contact them, or could lead to sweeping changes in human civilization. He added: \"Societies sure of their own place have disintegrated when confronted by a superior society, and others have survived even though changed. Clearly, the better we understand the factors involved in responding to such crises the better prepared we may be.\" Sociologist Ron Westrum expressed concerns about the implications of ET contact for our society: I think in some respects UFOs could present us with a situation analogous to captivity or conquest, or even more closely, to a child's relation to an unpredictable parent. The temptation in such circumstances to become passive and autistic is very strong. One need only consider how contact with superior technology introduced benignly can be disastrous, to appreciate what such technology introduced indifferently or malignantly might do. Societies which pride themselves on their technical superiority and advancement (as ours does) would seem particularly vulnerable .... One should not be fooled by the trivial effects on our society which UFOs now exert. UFOs are a Protean force. It is wise to consider not just the actual, but also potential, behavior. What UFOs do now should not be taken as a given; it could too easily change. \u2022 Another sociologist who specializes in social psychology, Robert L. Hall, has stated that fear of mass panic or individual human overreaction to extraterrestrial contact is basically a \"popular myth\" not grounded in objective research. But the myth persists in journalistic circles and influences public policy considerations. It is very common that public authorities act on the assumption that the public is likely to behave foolishly and even destructively in the face of a threat, especially an ill-understood threat. In the so-called invasion from Mars panic [Orson Welles's infamous fictional radio broadcast about Martians landing in New jersey), the commonly held, though distorted, view of how people reacted is based on the most extreme reactions [rather than the full range of reactions) .... From a close study of collective behavior, my informed guess as to how most people would react to extraterrestrial contact is that they would seek more information, and they would engage in lots of discussion of the significance of the contact. If plenty of credible information is available, there is very little risk of any harmful or destructive behavior of the kind we might call panic.\u2022 Dr. Michael D. Swords, professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, has studied closely the history of the government's handling of UFO reports. 10 For a special report on government UFO policy he contributed the following remarks about the potential impact of UFOs on society: \"The revelation of an alien presence might drive us even closer together into a World Community ... the Earth is slowly heading this way anyway. ... My guess is that, being in a rather different technostate than the Amazonian Shaman [whose 'dreams' were taken away by contact with Western culture], we would swiftly 'create new dreams.' Religion would adjust. Catholicism and others already have."

The best policy is to hope that the aliens go away or that the contacts and shakings up of earthly society happen during the next administration's reign.\" Perhaps the most comprehensive summary of reasons for official secrecy on UFOs is contained in the Majestic 12 briefing paper, allegedly prepared by Admiral Hillenkoetter for President-Elect Eisenhower in 1952: . Implications for the National Security are of continuing importance in that the motives and ultimate intentions of these visitors remain completely unknown. It is for these reasons, as well as the obvious international and technological considerations and the ultimate need to avoid a public panic at all costs, that the Majestic-12 Group remains of the unanimous opinion that imposition of the strictest security precautions should continue without interruption into the new administration . The Attitude of C. G. Jung  The great Swiss psychologist Dr. Carl Gustav Jung made a thorough study of UFOs since first becoming interested in 1946, and in addition to being a consultant to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) wrote a book entitled Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies37, which has led skeptics to jump to the conclusion that he regarded the phenomenon as entirely psychological in origin. Nothing could be further from the truth. While it is true that Jung devoted much space in his book to the individual and collective psychological reasons why people need to believe in flying saucers, he was in no doubt regarding their objective reality, a point overlooked in his book and in an article published in 1954:  A purely psychological explanation is ruled out by the fact that a large number of observations indicate a natural one, even a physical one. . . . The American Air Force (despite its contradictory statements), as well as the Canadian, consider the observations to be real. . . . However, the \"disks\" . . . do not behave in accordance with physical laws but as though without weight, and they show signs of intelligent guidance, by quasi-human pilots. [Original emphasis] His position on the cover-up was unequivocal. \"What astonishes me most,\" he wrote, \"is that the American Air Force, despite all the information in its possession and its so-called fear of creating panic, seems to work systematically to do that very thing . . . since it has never yet published an authentic and certain account of the facts, only occasionally allowing information to be dragged out of it by journalists.\" \"If it is true that the AAF or the government withholds tale-telling facts,\" he wrote to Major Donald Keyhoe, \"then one can only say that this is the most unpsychological and stupid policy one could invent. It is self-evident that the public ought to be told the truth, because ultimately it will nevertheless come to daylight. There can hardly be any greater shock than the H-bomb and yet everybody knows of it without fainting. \" Jung's opinions regarding the effects on society if the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs is officially confirmed are worth quoting in detail:  If . . . the extraterrestrial origin of the phenomena should be confirmed ... it would put us, without doubt, in the extremely precarious position of primitive communities today in conflict with the superior culture of the whites: the rudder would be removed from our grasp, and we should lose our pleasant dreams."

        "text_source": "Furthermore, for most abductees the hybridization has occurred simultaneously with an enlightenment imparted by the alien beings that has brought home forcibly to them the failure of the human experiment in its present form. Abduction experiencers come to feel deeply that the death of human beings and countless other species will occur on a vast scale if we continue on our present course and that some sort of new life-form must evolve if the hurman biological and spiritual essence is to be preserved. They do not generally question why the maintenance of human life must take such an odd form. I ask abductees repeatedly to explain to me why, if these hybrid beings are to represent the species that will repopulate our planet after the prophesied environmental holocaust, they appear so listless and frail on the ships, hardly vital stock to perpetuate the human or any other race. Only Peter has offered an answer by insisting that to him the hybrids do not appear listless, but have a vitality of their own. Jerry in a recent abduction has seen quite beautiful, angel-like, young adult hybrids with porcelain skin; their function was to show her on a screen the earth's inevitable future if the present course is not changed. For me the future role that the hybrid offspring are being prepared to play represents one of the most puzzling aspects of the entire abduction phenomenon. Those investigators who perceive the UFO abduction phenomenon from an adversarial perspective tend to interpret its meaning one-sidedly. The aliens are using us, the argument goes, for their own purposes, replenishing their genetic stock at our expense after some sort of holocaust on their own planet. If they make us feel that there is something worthwhile about the whole process, this is the result of deception. I would not say that the aliens never resort to deception to hide their purposes, but the above argument is, in my view, too narrow or linear an interpretation. My own impression is that we may be witnessing something far more complex, namely an awkward joining of two species, engineered by an intelligence we are unable to fathom, for a purpose, that serves both of our goals with difficulties for each. I base this view on the evidence presented by the abductees themselves. First, many abductees, for example, Scott and Peter, become aware in the course of our work that the alien/human union serves the reciprocal needs of each species, completing aspects of the identity of each that are missing or have been lost in the course 1 of evolution. Roughly speaking, the abductees experience the aliens as having remained less densely embodied and closer to the creative source in the universe from which human beings have been cut off. Through their interaction with the abductees they bring them (and all of us potentially) closer to our spiritual cosmic roots, return us to the divine light or \"Home,\" a \"place\" (really a state of being) where secrets, jealousy, greed, and destructiveness have no purpose. The aliens, on the other hand, as perceived by the experiencers, long to enjoy the intense emotionality that comes with our full embodiment. They are fascinated with our sensuality, our warmth, our capacity for eroticism, and deep parental affection, and they seem to respond to openhearted love."

This evaluation is apparently shared by the Chief of Staff in view of his expeditious approval and enthusiastic endorsement of initiation of the study\", General Trudeau wrote to the chief of ordnance in March 1959, in support of the army's \"Project HORIZON\", a strategic plan for deploying a military outpost on the surface of the moon.. It was the army's most ambitious response to the threat from extraterrestrials and, by the time I arrived at the Pentagon, it was one of the projects that General Trudeau had handed off to me to get moving. \"The boys at NASA are taking over the whole rocket launching business, Phil\", he said. \"And the army's not even getting the scraps left on the table. \" I had just left the White House when the National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed in 1958, and I knew what that had portended. It transferred the responsibility of space from the military services to a civilian run agency that was supposed to fulfill the U.S. promises to other countries for the demilitarization of space. It was a laudable goal, anyone would argue : demilitarize space so that countries could explore and experiment without the risk of losing their space vehicles or satellites to hostile activities. For the United States and the Russians the agreement meant that our respective astronauts and cosmonauts wouldn't make war on each other. Good idea. But someone forgot to tell it to the extraterrestrials, who had been systematically violating our planet's airspace for decades, if not centuries, and had already set up a base of operations on the moon. For General Trudeau and much of the U.S. military command, the Soviets' ability to put high payload vehicles and cosmonauts into orbit with relative ease was a frightening prospect. Unless the United States challenged Soviet technology with our own ongoing launch program and expanded our satellite surveillance, the army believed it would cede an all important strategic advantage to the Soviet Union. By 1960, we were reaching a critical juncture. Because of the development window and the time it took to get projects through development, programs started too late in the 1960s would be hopelessly obsolete by 1970, when the Soviets were expected to have established a presence in space. As in the U2 program, we had another agenda that concerned us more than just the Soviets' ability to threaten us with a nuclear missile capability from space. We were also very much aware of the ability of a dominant military power on Earth to establish its own version of a treaty with extraterrestrials. We had already seen how Stalin negotiated a separate non-aggression pact with Hitler, allowing the Germans to stabilize its Eastern front and invade Western Europe. We didn't want to see Khrushchev gain so much unchallenged power in space that the extraterrestrials would readily agree to some kind of accommodation with him guaranteeing both of them a degree of freedom to dominate the political affairs of our planet. This may seem paranoid now, in the 1990s, but in the late 1950s this was exactly the thinking of the military intelligence community. General Trudeau's concerns were the concerns of anybody who knew the truth about an alien presence around our planet and their abilities to drop on top of us from out of nowhere just like they had done in Roswell, in Washington, D.C., in 1952, and in countless other places around the world. And we didn't know if any one of these sightings could turn into a full-fledged landing in force or if an invasion hadn't already begun. If they could turn the Soviet government into a client state with a proxy army, there might be no checking their ability to exercise their will to colonize our planet, appropriate our natural resources, or, if the cattle mutilations and stories of abductions were true, conduct with complete impunity an organized experimentation or testing program on the life forms of this planet. In the absence of any information to disprove our fears, it was the military's obligation to project the worst possible scenario. That's why the army pushed for Project HORIZON. We had to have a plan. The Horizon documents were straight forward in expressing their concerns : We needed to put a fully armed military outpost on the moon first because if the Soviets achieved this objective before we did, we would be in the position of having to storm a hill or secure a military position. We would rather be the defenders of a strongly fortified enclave than the attackers. Our outpost had to be strong enough to withstand an assault and have enough personnel to conduct scientific experiments and continual surveillance of the earth and its airspace. Initially, General Trudeau argued, the outpost must be of sufficient size and contain sufficient equipment to permit the survival and moderate constructive activity of from ten to twenty personnel at a minimum. It must allow for expansion of the permanent facilities, resupply, and rotation of personnel to guarantee the maximum amount of time for a sustained occupancy. The general not only wanted the outpost to establish a beach head on the moon, he wanted it to be permanent and able to sustain itself for long periods without support from the earth. Therefore, location and design were critical and required, in the army's view, a triangulation station of moon to Earth baseline space surveillance system that facilitated:  (1) communication with and optimum observation of the earth,  (2) routine travel between the moon and the earth,  (3) the best possible exploration capability not only of the immediate area of the lunar surface but long range exploration expeditions and, most importantly from the army's perspective,  (4) the military defense of the moon base. The army's primary objective was to establish the first permanent manned installation on the moon and nothing less. The military potential of the moon was paramount, but the mission allowed for an ongoing investigation of the commercial and scientific potentials of the outpost as well. The army wanted to make Horizon conform to existing national policy on space exploration, even insofar as the demilitarization of space was concerned. But it was tough because all of us in the military services who had come in contact with the Roswell file believed that we were already under some form of attack. Demilitarizing space only meant playing into the hands of a culture that had displayed a hostile intent toward us. But we also realized that overtly establishing a military presence in space would encourage the Soviets to match us step for step and result in an arms race in outer space that would exacerbate Cold War tensions. Armaments in space might be more difficult to control, and the chance of an accidental military exchange could have easily precipitated a crisis on Earth. Thus, the whole problem of what to do about establishing a military presence in space was a conundrum. Horizon was the army's attempt to accomplish its military objectives within the context of the government's demilitarization policy. The army faced another obstacle in its plans from the members of the Roswell working group who were still establishing and enforcing policy at levels above top secret. The working group correctly saw that any independent military expedition into space, especially for the purpose of establishing an outpost on the moon, had a high probability of encountering extraterrestrials. In this encounter, there was no guarantee that a military exchange would not ensue or, at the very least, a military report would be filed. Even if these reports were kept top secret, given the military bureaucracy and the presence of legislative oversight it was highly unlikely that the press would not learn about military encounters with aliens. Thus, the basic premise of the working group and its entire mission, the camouflage of our discovery of alien life forms visiting and probably threatening Earth, would be undermined and years of successful operations might easily be brought to an unsatisfactory end. No, the working group would rather have the exploration of space in the hands of a civilian agency whose bureaucracy could be more easily controlled and whose personnel would be handpicked, at least at the outset, by the members of the working group."

The aliens' disregard for human free will and emotion is one of their most disturbing aspects. That disregard also troubled abduction researcher Budd Hopkins. He concluded a September 1987 paper entitled Ethical Implications of the UFO Abduction Phenomenon with these words:  Either the UFO occupants have not grasped the psychological toll they are taking in these abductions and genetic experiments because they really do not understand human psychology, ...or ... they must be viewed as a callous, indifferent, amoral race bent solely upon gratifying its own scientific needs at whatever the cost to us, the victims. The question of which alternative is true cannot be presently answered. There is evidence to support both interpretations, but I, for one, wish to choose the former. Regardless of the ultimate truth, thousands of bizarre, bloodless animal mutilations have happened for a long time and continue. Thousands of people worldwide describe close encounters with alien craft and beings. Perhaps straightforward proof of their existence is something the alien entities do not want humans to have - yet. If we understood the whole story of genetic harvests, cloning and hybrids, we might realize Earth has been Someone Else's genetic pharmacy and there is no guarantee that Homo sapiens sapiens will survive. Computer scientist Jacques Vallee said in his 1988 book Dimensions, We are dealing with a control system, and he discussed the behavior modification research of psychologist B.F. Skinner. Certain ways of reinforcing behavior lead to better learning than others. If the training is too even and monotonous, the subject may stop in its development or even return to an earlier state. The best schedule of reinforcement is one that combines periodicity and unpredictability. (Vallee's emphasis.) Learning is then slow, but continuous. It leads to the highest level of adaptation. But adaptation to what exactly? The pattern of UFO activity since the 1940s has been one of periodic flaps that occur unpredictably. The mutilation phenomenon has also occurred in cycles with unpredictable variations in the bloodless cuts and physical condition of the animals that have baffled investigators. Are the aliens trying to convince us in a theatrical and symbolic drama that another life form is here and is capable of technological feats beyond human comprehension? Is it their goal to cause fear and confusion in order to control human thought and behavior?"

He speculates broadly: Or should we hypothesize that an advanced race somewhere in the universe and sometime in the future has been showing us three-dimensional space operas for the last two thousand years, in an attempt to guide our civilization? If so; do they deserve our congratulations? . . . Are we dealing instead with a parallel universe, another dimension, where there are human races living, and where we may go at our expense, never to return to the present? Are these races only semihuman, so that in order to maintain contact with us, they need cross-breeding with men and women of our planet? Is this the origin of the many tales and legends where genetics plays a great role: the symbolism of the Virgin in occultism and religion, the fairy tales involving human midwives and changelings, the sexual overtones of the flying saucer reports, the biblical stories of intermarriage between the Lord's angels and terrestrial women, whose offspring were giants? From that mysterious universe, are higher beings projecting obj ects that can materialize and dematerialize at will? Are the UFOs \"windows\" rather than \"objects\"? There is nothing to support these assumptions, and yet, in view of the historical continuity of the phenomenon, alternatives are hard to find, unless we deny the reality of all the facts, as our peace of mind would indeed prefer ( 1988, p. 143-44 ). Where facts are lean, inconsistent, or disparate, human beings, \u00b7Vallee assures us, are quick to fin\u00b7 in the gaps. \"Because many observations of UFO phenomena appear self -consistent and at the same time irreconcilable with scientific knowledge, a logical vacuum has been created that human imagination tries to fill with fantasy\" ( 1988, p. 1 45)."

        "text_source": "  As the twentieth century draws to a close, cattle mutilations continue, crop circles are more elaborate than in the past, and the abduction experience appears to be more widespread than ever, in spite of the debunkers and media-supported public disbelief. The UFO issue appears to be coming to head. New realities are impinging upon our collective consciousness. Two concepts increasingly accepted by all but the most intransigent skeptic are that there is much more to life than our own brief material existence on Earth and that we are not alone on our world. The concept that we are not alone is supported by overwhelming evidence, including multitudinous sightings, photographs, films and video, radar contacts, personal confrontations, abduction reports, crop circles, animal mutilations, channeled messages, multiple-witness reports, and physical evidence such as indented landing sites, holes in the ground, burned vegetation, human scars, and implants. Some of the human reports and photographic evidence undoubtedly are the product of misinterpretation or hoaxers, but the sheer number and consistency of descriptions argues against all of them being mistakes or fakes. Another argument supporting the idea of nonhuman visitors is the longevity of the reports. If sightings had occurred only in recent times, they might be attributable to some passing mass psychosis, an aberrant copycat function of minds frightened by the onrush of modern technology. But reports of flying machines and unearthly visitors predate man's history. And the evidence of technology superior to ours in the distant past is particularly compelling. Although there is no clear indication that such technology was the product of alien visitation rather than some lost civilization of man, the many ancient tales of sky-gods and their flying craft tip the scales in favor of alien contact. The possibility of ancient astronauts provides not only a credible explanation for legends and strange artifacts in man's history but also for the documented anomalies on the moon and Mars-some of which appear strikingly similar to our own mysterious Great Pyramid. It would seem that early UFOs were viewed and reported through the perspective of the times in which they were observed. Thus, it was only near mid-twentieth century that UFOs began to take the form of flying machines. In view of the sum total of evidence available today, it would appear that the earth is being visited by a wide variety of craft bearing many different species. This created confusion in the past because most people had trouble conceiving of even one type of visitor to Earth. There can be no doubt that beginning at least with World War II, military and government authorities in the United States took a keen interest in reports of flying craft and the glowing orbs that chased warplanes. Much material exists to suggest that the leaders of Nazi Germany may have developed a flying saucer based on advanced technology, which ended up in the hands of another nation. Whether this saucer was the result of human ingenuity or perhaps alien contact has yet to be been determined. The year 1947 marked an obvious turning point in the government's attitude toward the subject, adding considerable weight to speculation that something unearthly was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico, and perhaps other locations. Where the government had acknowledged the possibility of extraterrestrial craft and beings prior to 1947, a new attitude of dismissal and ridicule was instituted. Right up to today, official denial has effectively blocked any public consideration of the phenomenon. Yet consistent internal reports and testimony from a variety of people showed that official interest in UFOs at the highest levels of government never diminished-only went deep undercover. The Brookings report coupled with numerous public statements by several different officials indicated that leaders were fearful of the knowledge they had concerning UFOs. They feared disruption of public institutions and panic. Military officers, as always, viewed exotic technology as potential weapon systems to be kept secret from any potential enemy. Other leaders may have been less concerned about the public's state of mind or military security than about their own interests in maintaining control over public institutions, technologies, and profits. It is clear from the record that beginning in 1952, government intelligence, initially the CIA, began to assume control over the UFO issue. U.S. Air Force Project Blue Book became merely a public relations front with a twofold purpose: to quiet the public clamor by dismissing as many UFO reports as possible and yet at the same time quietly collecting serious UFO information that was passed along to higher authorities. It appears highly plausible that about this same time, a top-level, highly secret group of military officers, scientists, and other leaders was established to study the UFO issue-an MJ-12 group in effect if not in name. According to a wide variety of sources, such a group still operates today. Such a group would clearly more represent the wealthy top 2 percent of the United States population than the bottom 98 percent, and it is fair to assume that their interests-particularly from the standpoint of self-survival-might not coincide with the best interests of the general public. Then there are the bizarre stories-too many from too many different sources to ignore-that at some point representatives of the government may have in fact made contact with aliens. All of this would presuppose the tightest secrecy possible by government-exactly the situation discerned by a study of the historical record. However, this wall of silence may have developed some cracks in recent years. It may be that our leaders are making sporadic efforts to condition the public to the idea of alien visitation. Strange alien creatures have been showing up in everything from expensive Super Bowl TV ads and children's cartoons to series such as The X-Files and Dark Skies, not to mention blockbuster movies. While the profit motive undoubtedly plays a large part, that such airings are allowed indicates to many that such concepts are being encouraged by the leadership of the tightly controlled mass media. A truly free and democratic people-such as we like to think of ourselves being-should assert their right to the same knowledge as the wealthiest members of society. After all, we will all share equally in the future of Earth. It could very well be that the reason so many ordinary people claim to have had contact with alien beings is that those human leaders who have sought to keep the public ignorant of the alien presence are being bypassed. Despite what appears to be a concerted effort by government and others to hide away this alien presence, an ever-growing number of people are becoming conscious of this new reality through a variety of means, including personal contact, channeled messages, the wider dissemination of news and information through computer networks, books, movies, TV, videos, a growing number of public speakers, plain old intuition, and military-developed remote viewing."

        "text_source": "Still, it's a step that other scientists consider controversial. Once you start attempting genetic engineering in monkeys, humans can't be far behind, says Professor Lori Andrews of the ChicagoKent College of Law. Actually, UFO researchers have been suggesting for some time that this is exactly what is going on with millions of adults living in the United States alone. And, just as in the monkey's case, the abductee does not go willingly and never has to consent. But a simple, stark fact that most scientists agree on is that when you move DNA from one species to another, there's no telling how the new combination of genes will interact or what possibly lethal effects might result.19 For those of us interested in the impact upon our species of ostensible ET genetic manipulation, the opponents of bioengineered foods make a major relevant point: that the action of any gene can depend upon the species in which it is placed. Abductees, instead of having nightmares about possible creations of superweed, might substitute the term supervirus-a highly possible by-product of DNA transfer between species that could be unleashed on the human race, either unknowingly or intentionally. In a somewhat different problem of biology, scientists know that although transplanted organs from primates to humans would provide the best chance of taking, the idea is rejected for fear of transmitting retroviruses into the human population. With virtually no informed public consent, science has taken the human species to the very outposts of a new frontier in understanding how life can be created, altered, manipulated, and changed. Whether all these things should be done or not is a different question-one that we all need to seriously consider. Just because science can make something happen doesn't always mean that it should, according to the distinguished philosopher of science Philip Kitchner. There is, he says, no definitive right to pursue knowledge for its own sake, with no regard for consequences. It may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own culture has already confronted the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the life-forms on Earth from those of other planets or in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, abductees can only hope and pray that the extraterrestrials know what they are doing-that we are not just the experimental-lab wet-brains, those mushy and unstable biological organisms who might well be candidates for upgrading to posthumanist level, at the very least. Disturbing thoughts, I'll admit. Who wants to feel this helplessly ignorant and in the hands of an unknown force that most people are still embarrassed to acknowledge as an intermittent presence on Earth? Our little lives are difficult and complex enough without the oblique shadow of alien intruders or anthropologists hovering over our heads. The predicament we're in brings to mind one of Budd's many stories, an anecdote about one of his first New York art dealers, a tiny Jewish woman named Tirca. Taking some paintings up to her Madison Avenue gallery one day, Budd, a politically involved young artist, launched into a passionate monologue on a particular issue of the day. As he pressed on, enumerating the intricacies of the problem, Tirca put up a weary hand: Stop! Stop! Just tell me this, she said. Is it good for the Jews, or is it bad for the Jews? The Sweet Spot in the Asteroid Belt Even the phrase It came from outer space! almost needs to be accompanied by a theremin, that quirky electronic instrument-a slightly ominous, tongue-in-cheek sound-that accompanied so many 1950's science-fiction movies. But in December 2001, scientists from the NSA's Ames Research Center reported in the journal Nature that their most recent findings led them to a startling conclusion: Sugars from space may have nourished the first life on Earth. This source of life did come from outer space, with no theremin accompainment. A pair of meteorites, carbon-rich asteroid fragments that fell to Earth have been well studied, mainly because one of them is loaded with organic compounds, including amino acids and sugars, the building blocks of proteins. The NASA team says this implies that life on Earth might have originally been seeded by organic compounds falling from the skies. An alternative theory suggests that all Earth's life would have had to start from scratch, forming its own life-giving compounds here on the young planet. Now the team has discovered a sugar molecule in the same meteorites-another essential building block of life-that might have landed here from outer space. Sugars, life's main energy store, form part of the backbone of the DNA and RNA molecules, found in all living organisms. So, like Tirca, let's jump to the bottom line: There's a daily unfolding drama over what's safe and what's still unknown about bioengineered plants, animals, and humans. How can we know if what seems to be substantial alien intervention in our population is good for the humans-or bad for the humans? The best we can do at this point is stay tuned to the cutting-edge work in our own biotechnologies, hoping for some parallel insights into alien activity. A First Step: Creation of a Sheep-Goat In the 1980's, dramatic advances in gene transfer technology began toppling the presumed solid barrier between species in laboratories around the world. For example, in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of California at Davis, researchers are working with a variety of transgenic technologies using domestic livestock. The group's emphasis is on establishing cows and other large animals as producers of pharmaceutical drugs, such as blood-clotting factors for humans that would be expressed in the cows' milk. By combining cells from goats and sheep, The Embryo Transfer Lab at UC Davis has also made an end run around the natural barriers that generally put an end to interspecies pregnancy through miscarriage. In the usual scenario involving interspecies fertilization, the fetus is experienced as a foreign body within the mother and she expels it from her body. The UC Davis team transferred cells between the species to produce fertile, healthy sheep-goat chimeras, i.e., a goat or sheep that produces both sheep and goat blood cells. By using certain embryo manipulation techniques with a chimeric female, the researchers have created an interspecies pregnancy in which the pregnant nanny goat is able to tolerate the foreign sheep fetus without aborting it. The sheep genes flowing in the nanny's blood recognize the fetus as hers, preventing her from rejecting the fetus as a hostile takeover attempt. The Cloning of a Sheep Named Dolly Why does the whole world know the name of a curly-haired barnyard beauty named Dolly? Since she burst upon the science scene in 1997, Dolly, the Scottish sheep who was cloned from another sheep's adult cell, has been mentioned in over four thousand news articles in major U.S. magazines and newspapers alone, as well as in countless other print outlets and radio and television broadcasts around the world. She's also the subject of at least fourteen books for the layperson. Intercut on television with footage from Frankenstein, Brave New World, and The Boys from Brazil, Dolly's fame emerged instantly, not from what she really is, but from what she represents. To the billions of people who took note of Dolly's creation, she's the living proof that genetic cloning of adult human beings is no longer in the realm of the impossible. This innocent-looking white ewe has become a metaphor for the seemingly godlike power that scientists now have to both create and control life. Dolly's creators, biologists Ian Wilmut and Keith Campbell of Scotland's Roslin Institute, are a bit startled at the public's fascination with Dolly, who has become the world's first famous cloned large animal. What the researchers wish that we understand is that Dolly should matter to ordinary people for reasons other than because she was successfully cloned from a single adult cell of another sheep or that she is that sheep's genetic replica, in some spooky imitation of science fiction. In their book The Second Creation: The Age of Biological Control by the Scientists Who Cloned Dolly, Campbell and Wilmut are clear that popular media has misrepresented what Dolly represents to them, at least. Her true significance, they say, is in the fact that Dolly's creation laid the groundwork for making the best use of transgenic animals-those expressing a specific transplanted gene from another species. The transplanted trait might involve the production of leaner meat, for example, or spider-silk strands and pharmaceutical drugs that can be expressed in animals' milk. Dolly isn't significant only because she was a clone from a mammary or skin cell, but because once the ideal transgenic sheep is created, the refined craft of cloning gives scientists the power to multiply that ideal animal almost indefinitely. Cloning, or the making of multiple copies of an organism, the biologists believe, is just the beginning of the many benefits that humankind will derive from engineering all types of organisms, both plant and animal. Human and environmental needs, after all, are always changing, never constant. The bioengineer's goal is to discover ways to genetically alter the life-forms around us-including us-to better meet those new conditions."

I do not know what data supports that statement. However, Bob Girard addressed a similar theme in his book about octaves of intelligence. After comparing humanity's unchecked population growth and careless environmental pollution to spreading crab grass, Girard concluded that another octave of intelligence might be on the verge of exterminating imperfect humanity as humans would exterminate crab grass to protect a lawn. In Biblical history, that is supposed to be what happened in the times of Noah and Sodom and Gommorah. Bob wrote: The moral issue is: whether to annihilate the human plague entirely and non-selectively as the biological infestation humans are for the higher octave, or to first scan the human species and remove the most highly aware members before exterminating the unaware masses of the species. After a time, when the 'pesticide' has worn off, this nucleus of highly aware humans could be returned to the planet, to the human octave, to become the progenitors of the next human cycle. It has been said that one of the evils of any cycle of civilization is the tendency for knowledge which equals power to become concentrated among tiny cliques of intelligent men and converted from a means with which to serve all mankind into a means for forcing all of mankind to serve the knowledgeable. There is truth in the human octave that 'power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely'. There is a point at which knowledgeable men begin to fear that their knowledge would be misconstrued by ordinary men; that the ordinary man was not ready to have certain knowledge/power bestowed on him freely; that it is better for those few who know what knowledge is and what it can do to use it 'wisely', and thus protect man, in effect, from himself. There is, of course, a point at which this reasoning ceases to reflect genuine concern by the knowledgeable and begins to reflect a lust for power over one's neighbors and a hypocrisy which must justify the lofty words. * * Source: Elements of the Equation by Robert C.

For instance, new developments in gaming, will soon be virtual reality immersion. Why bother trying to solve real-world problems (or even learning about them) when you can become a virtual James Bond or date your favorite movie star in a near-real-life immersive setting? The western world long ago mastered the art of public relations in the service of political conformity and corporate profits. Clearly, the lessons of the past will be applied to our brave new world. The result may well be a zombie world of people drugged up on pharmaceuticals, ingesting processed and unhealthy GMO foods, uneducated in the history of their society, and living in an illusory world designed to distract and deflect. In other words, what modern America and much of the world already looks like, only more so, with people detached from their true selves, spinning out fantasies and simply running out the clock. Granted, alarmists have made such claims for years about the impact of magazines, comic books, radio dramas and more. However, we might remind ourselves that some of those criticisms were probably valid. More to the point, the power of our current system of distractions is much greater than anything human culture has experienced before. In such a world, there could even be a danger of specific classes and even subspecies of humanity being developed. There could be, quite literally, a master race with greater strength and intelligence, and with longer lifespans, presiding over a world of human drones, kept suitably stupid for a life of service and distraction. We already have clear and distinct classes of humanity; what is to prevent such a nightmare from entering our very biology? If such a future comes to fruition, perhaps it will be possible to keep the end of UFO secrecy at bay for a much longer time. Perhaps. But for how long? A century? Two centuries? At some point, even in such an awful future, the secrecy program would merely be an exercise in staving off the inevitable. Even under the worst circumstances, the end of secrecy will come. Besides, the situation is unlikely to deteriorate quite that rapidly before, say, 2035 or so, roughly twenty years from this writing. The relevance of all this for Disclosure is that because we are changing so rapidly, it seems very likely that we will develop the capability, openly and finally, to prove the matter of UFO reality to ourselves without need for official government acknowledgment. Once we get to that point, once this reality is rapidly and widely understood, governments around the world will have no choice but to acknowledge the obvious."

        "text_source": "I am also a researcher of abduction reports, and from these contacts emerged a number of accounts that shed important light on the alien agenda of human interaction. This book is the result of lengthy investigations into the abduction experiences of eight women from various parts of the country. The correlation of evidence from their accounts greatly widens the parameters of the abduction scenario and points to certain aspects, previously disregarded or avoided, in need of serious exploration. This is also a personal book, a collation of unique, intimate accounts of alien-human interactions. The people who share their experiences here are courageous representatives of the many others in this country and elsewhere whose lives partake of parallel realities. They function successfully in a world shared by everyone else, as housewives, mothers, grandmothers, artists, nurses, counselors, teachers, computer engineers, and blue-collar workers. But in the blink of an eye - or the flash of multicolored lights strobing in the hall late at night - their normal lives can disappear, and they find themselves taken into the time and space of an alien world. It is difficult for most abduction memories to be investigated in a purely scientific manner, especially since they are often suppressed, surfacing only as vague flashbacks and dreamlike episodes. In this field there has been strong objection to anecdotal information. But the scientific approach to the study of the UFO phenomenon as a whole has proven less than successful. In spite of half a century of many intelligent people researching the UFO and alien presence with scientific methods, reliable answers to the primary questions have not been found. Investigations of sightings reports, landing traces, photos and video tapes, alleged implants, and related government documents have amassed a mountain of data and a number of theories-but nothing indisputably true about the nature of UFOs and their non-human occupants, their origin, or the reason for their presence here among us now. Great gains have been made in the area of abduction therapy, providing help and support for those who are living with the phenomenon and working to resolve their emotional trauma, to keep the disruption of their everyday lives to a minimum, and to transform or assimilate these experiences in a positive way. And while is this laudable, it is not necessarily research. Therapy's goal is one of personal balance, but the goal of research is a larger, clearer understanding of the phenomenon. The point is not so much learning to live with abductions as it is finding out why they happen, what they mean, and whether and how the situation can be altered. The need for reliable answers is nowhere greater than in the abduction phenomenon. It intimately affects people of all ages and backgrounds, irrevocably altering their personal lives and their perceptions of reality, and it raises immense questions about our past, present, and future as a species. But in spite of the best scientific approaches to the question, all that ufological research has brought to most people is a realization that UFOs exist-and perhaps a few cute, harmless aliens-but no confrontation with what this means. Science has been trying to measure a dream, it seems, using traditional ideas and practices, and it has proved elusive. The UFO phenomenon is not confined to our current scientific understanding of perceived reality. We do not yet have the technology or natural perceptive abilities to capture and assess it. That is why the scientific approach to photographic evidence, landing traces, implants, and document analyses has so little in the way of hard evidence to show for its work. Instead, its best results offer only circumstantial data, carrying very little more weight than the anecdotal data of abduction research in the scales of traditional science. It is in the abduction phenomenon that we come most urgently face to face with the alien presence and thus have our best opportunity to observe the activity and assess its purpose or agenda. All of the UFO photos in the world tell us nothing compared to the words of those who have encountered the alien force in their lives and those of their families. And there are many, like Pat and Amy and the others presented here. From the response to INTOTHE FRINGE, it sometimes seemed that abduction experiences were becoming virtually epidemic. Yet studies by mental health professionals show that the people who make these reports are eminently sane, that the aftermath of these events is real, and that they do not spring from any mass psychosis but from experienced anomalous trauma. I also found that many of the reports contained details very similar to certain things my family and I had experienced. Still, in every case there was always present the \"unique factor\" within the situations, providing highly individualized episodes for each abductee. I often wondered if these unique events, these \"one-time shots,\" might not prove to have some unperceived correlations, to form a pattern as yet out of focus, and give us more information than the now-recognized patterns of certain exams, baby presentations, and the like. Far from being a neat, limited phenomenon, alien interaction with humans is still very much a riddle, mystery, enigma, and more. Abduction research has not yet produced answers, but there are certainly different theories to be had-an embarrassment of riches, really. Unfortunately, these theories rest on a very partial, highly selective use of the data, rather than dealing with the complexities of the entire, life-long and minute-by-minute, reality of the abduction scenario. It is more than the sum of its parts. The intermittent UFO sightings, missing-time episodes, conscious encounters, and virtual-reality scenarios are like blank milestones on a journey which, for the abductee, is continuous and headed in an unknown direction."

By his account, the greys are distant ancestors of Martians, who are even now struggling with the loss of atmosphere and environment on their own planet. Both the Martians and the greys tried to cope with their realities by external intellect. They built spaceships and other devices to help them in their evolution, but lost the internal energy of love and emotion-the so-called Christ-Consciousness-that allows all sentient beings to connect with the universal whole. The Greys now realize that to get out of the trap they created for themselves by separating themselves from the source of life, they have to get back their emotional bodies. Unfortunately, the only way they know how to do this is by studying us intellectually, which, of course, will never work, explained Frissell. However, according to Drunvalo, the greys made contact with a secret government on Earth prior to World War II and have traded their advanced technology for the right to experiment on the earth, which included animal mutilations and human abductions. Whether you call them the secret government, the Illuminati, the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission, or the Council on Foreign Relations, the name is irrelevant, Frissell noted, echoing the statements of Bramley and others. The 'secret government' is basically made up of the richest people in the world. There are about 2,000 of them and they have been controlling our so-called governments for a long time. They control who gets elected, when, and where; they control when there is a war and when there isn't. They control planetary food shortages and whether a country's currency is inflated or deflated. All these things are dominated completely by these people. They can't control natural disasters, of course, but they can and do control a lot. Drunvalo said that by the late 1960s, this secret government learned from scientists that a planetary disaster was imminent and began to join their assets in both the United States and the former Soviet Union in an effort to design an escape plan for themselves. He said that both nations secretly used grey technology to build their own saucers and that about 50 percent of the UFOs sighted are our own. He added that this secret government has built secret bases on both the moon and Mars, explaining some of the anomalies on both. However, in basically supporting this Alternative 3 scenario, Drunvalo said that the people within the secret government have become like the greys and are in danger of losing their emotional bodies to sheer intellect. According to Drunvalo, the greys are on the way out, not having learned enough regarding inner growth to survive on their physical plane. And members of the secret government have begun to realize that they cannot survive on their own. They need love and unity consciousness too and so are allowing more and more material to be made available to a wider public audience in opposition to their previous policy of maintaining strict secrecy."

Their reach has now extended to almost every country on earth, and the density of reports within individual countries has also been on the rise over the past several years. The unavoidable conclusion is that the phenomenon is evolving, and this has convinced many people around the world-many of whom were long-time skeptics-that the crop circle mystery is real, and that it has meaning. The simple has now become complex; few has become many; random has become commonplace. Logically, this kind of measurable evolvement-this gracious unfolding of spectacular beauty-must have a purpose, and I believe that purpose to be the transmittal of some kind of information. The phenomenon is moving towards something; perhaps towards many things, and its increasing complexity and its insistence on making itself known through bolder and more widespread formations, may have great import for mankind and the future of this planet. It is my belief that the meaning of the crop circle mystery has evolved into something that needs to be understood by man, and that this message is important and should not be ignored. We began by not knowing anything beyond the fact that we were looking at flattened plants in a circle. We now know that hundreds of plants flattened into a series of forms creating an overall geometry-the Julia Set (Chapter 6) comes immediately to mind-arises from the science of fractal mathematics. We know that all of nature is comprised of fractals and that we can see their geometric patterns in everything: from the Nautilus mollusk shell, to the spiraling arms of the galaxies. The science of fractal mathematics describes a geometric pattern that is repeated endlessly at ever small scales to produce irregular shapes and surfaces that cannot be represented by classical geometry. Fractals are paradoxes. Using nothing but squares and straight lines, a curve can be created. As the squares decrease in size, a graceful spiral curve is created by connecting specific points of the smaller and smaller boxes. This spiraling infinite curve' can be found in flowers and other natural forms, and its proportions have been used in art and architectures since man first scratched symbols onto cold cave walls. We do not know how or where this will end. I have long believed that the most important door opener-the Eureka moment-will be when we are able to fully understand not only the meanings of the individual patterns, but also the meaning of the designs within the context of all the authentic worldwide formations. Placement will become a key factor in tying everything together, and where designs appear will become as significant to the overall meaning and understanding of the mystery as to what particular patterns appear in any given year. For instance, seemingly random occurrences will become meaningful. Circle A will appear around the time of Event B, which will take place near ancient archaeological site C, and all of these clues will come together and give us the answers we are seeking. At some point in the future, the crop circle phenomena will have done its job and we will all fully understand its true purpose. That moment has not yet arrived however, and so we must continue our work, and continue to open our hearts and minds to the enigma in the fields. 1.8 Spirituality and Crop Circles The first act of awe, when man was struck with the beauty or wonder of Nature, was the first spiritual experience. -Henryk Skolimowski I have often used the term spiritual nudge to describe what I consider to be one of the fundamental purposes of crop circles."

        "text_source": "This thesis seems to have been true for the military-trained remote viewers, who voluntarily chose to take a mental look at UFO occupants and had confidence in their RV expertise. None of them apparently have suffered any ill effects simply from viewing what they perceived as alien races. But while religious fundamentalists may have trouble dealing with the concept of aliens as opposed to angels and demons, many clerics voice a certain equanimity when it comes to the idea of life outside the earth. Speaking in reaction to the discovery of the meteorite said to contain fossils of ancient Martian life, the Reverend James A. Wiseman, chairman of the Department of Theology at Catholic University, said, Personally, I've always believed we will find life on other planets. He said those whose faith might be shaken by aliens are those who believe God created life on Earth and Earth alone. He added that changing such an egocentric and ethnocentric mind-set might require a massive shift in beliefs comparable to Copernicus persuading the public that the earth actually revolved around the sun. What this challenges, interestingly enough, is not classical Christian and Jewish theism, which has always known that everything that is, is God's creation, stated Stanley Hauerwas, professor of theological ethics at Duke University Divinity School. It challenges the high humanism that has been characteristic of our lives since the 17th century, namely that the human species is what it's all about, that everything exists to serve us. James Leo Garrett, a professor at the conservative Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, did not exclude the possibility of extraterrestrial life. We need to be cautious saying that life on other planets is precluded, because [the Bible] also says that God is the creator of all, he said. New York's Jewish Theological Seminary professor Burton Visotzky remarked that the stories of creatures, spirits, demons, and angels down through history suggests that nonhuman beings might exist. He indicated that rabbinical tradition has accepted such a possibility since the fourth century. Fathi Osman, a retired professor of Islamic studies at the University of Southern California, provided a quote from the Koran that seems to indicate that God created life outside of Earth. He pointed to Surah 42:29, which reads, And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the Earth. And the living creatures that He has scattered through them. And He has power to gather them together when He wills. While the debate over the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life continues, more and more people are claiming to have made contact with beings from beyond, and recent scientific discoveries have brought new knowledge that lends support to the concepts offered in metaphysical messages. Contactees, remote viewers, and spiritualists have all spoken of visiting planets outside our solar system for many years. Yet it was only in April 1994 that Penn State astrophysicist Alexander Wolszczan pub-lished convincing data proving what until then had been only speculation: that planets do exist outside our solar system. Wolszczan confirmed the presence of three planets circling a pulsar star in the constellation Virgo. His discovery was quickly followed in 1996, when San Francisco State University astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler announced the discovery of two planets-one in the Ursae Majoris system and the other in the Virgo constellation-which appeared to be temperate enough for water to exist in liquid form, a presumed prerequisite for life as we know it. As noted by U.S. News & World Report writer Traci Watson, The discovery that other planets exist boosts the chances that somewhere aliens do, too. The 1996 discovery of what appear to be Martian fossils in a meteorite only increased the chances further. When the military-trained remote viewers returned from their mental voyages and described multiple dimensions, distance planets, and stars and travel through time, their own bosses were so skeptical of their claims that they refused to pass such information along to higher authorities. But in a series of recent books, sober-minded physicists are now claiming to have found evidence of a top quark, which they take to be a key element in their current view of our physical universe. According to some scientists, It is a universe where space exists in 10 dimensions, where one can travel through time into the past, where holes in the fabric of space and time pop up and serve as shortcuts to other parts of the universe, and where the visible universe may be only one of myriad mini-universes that coexist like so many soap bubbles in a cosmic froth. But no hard-and-fast answers are available to the objective researcher as yet, for such answers transcend the material world. They cannot be answered with a computer, slide rule, microscope, or telescope. They can only be addressed by each individual as his or her mind-set allows."

I said to Lenin that the development of human technology might some day change the world situation. The Marxist conception itself would then become meaningless. Lenin looked at me and he said:  \t'You are right. I understood this myself when I read your novel The Time Machine. All human conceptions are on a scale of our planet. They are based on the pretension that the technical potential, although it will develop, will never exceed the terrestrial limit. If we succeed in establishing interplanetary communication, all our philosophical, moral and social views will have to be revised. In this case, the technical potential, become limitless, would impose the end of the role of violence as a means and method of progress.' There is no denying the possibility that, once it is established beyond doubt that extraterrestrials are visiting Earth, the social, philosophical, scientific and economic repercussions would have a profound effect on us all, irrespective of differing nationalities. Should the 'visitors' pose threats to humanity, the likelihood is that this will lead to an unprecedented degree of unity between the nation-states. During the Geneva summit conference of November 1985, US President Ronald Reagan made that point to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when he told him 'how much easier his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this Earth together.' In referring to this discussion during a speech given at the Kremlin in 1987, Gorbachev added that 'The US President said that if the Earth faced an invasion by extraterrestrials, the United States and the Soviet Union would join forces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute the hypothesis, though I think it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion ...'"

        "text_source": "Wood then focuses his attention upon an area that few of those with an interest in the MJ-12 controversy have even considered: Or do the documents create a 'fire break' against learning an even deeper secret? Suppose that any one of the explicit and controversial sentences, let alone entire documents, of the MJ-12 material are genuine, in the sense that it was produced by a real psychological warfare organization. It is conceivable to concoct a very closely similar, but intentionally different, project as a smokescreen against a deeper secret. Is the secret being concealed one of those truths so precious that a 'bodyguard of lies' must protect it? What would warrant such an effort? Is the current Majestic discussion of crashed extraterrestrial discs and technology a smokescreen for live E.T.s and fully functional lines of communication and technology transfer? This argument leads deeper than the debunkers can dare imagine. Indeed, it does. Wood continues: If the Majestic documents are mere fabrications, how far must we go to rationalize the creation of such documents? Is it credible that a crack psychological warfare disinformation team - whether operating out of the bowels of the NSA, the underground Groom Lake mine, or elsewhere - would decide to be 'really clever' and try to hide some super secret, or divert the enemy's attention by taking an existing highly secure project (MJ-12), use its actual name, subject matter, along with identifying scores of living personnel, then change presumably key details, and then reveal this alleged deception to a target, and potentially to the public? As one fellow researcher said to me, it's 'like doing the dance of the seven veils with wet Kleenex.' A logical conclusion, states Wood, might be that one of the most highly protected super secrets of our time was intentionally revealed, whether to a wider public, or to foreign intelligence, it does not matter. The initial disclosure would be very risky, as it would draw attention to the general nature of the UFO and ET matter, irrespective of clouding the details, and would certainly prompt more intensive and sophisticated intelligence targeting by foreign intelligence assets. In short, if it is a psychological warfare operation, revealing the MJ-12 documents is inept because it will attract, and has attracted, much new attention. Alternatively, Wood asks, did the Soviets or Chinese create these materials, insert some in the files of the National Archives and Records Administration, then release most of them in the 1990s after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in order to bring the capitalist enemy to its knees? America, your government is hiding UFOs: throw off your chains and embrace the glorious socialist future. Judge for yourself. Wood then reveals the words of a senior government official who has commented specifically on the MJ-12 documents: My gut says they're real; contain the usual inconsistencies, mistakes and anomalies that derive from government work every day (even at the highest levels, especially where there is no effort to make things 'credible' for outside view, since they were never intended for outside view); and correspond to a set of phenomena that have been too consistently reported, for too long, by too many sane people. What otherwise do we do with apparently authentic letters like that from Sarbacher? Tools of the same disinformation campaign? Or if from the Soviets (who else? ), is it to promote distrust and cynicism toward our 'government conspiracy' and foster social unrest? If so, they spent a lot of time and money and incredibly detailed research to little effect, since the vast majority of Americans have no knowledge of these documents, and the few who do are in conflict over them. Do the Majestic Documents Specifically Mention Psychological Warfare? What is the internal evidence of the documents themselves? What posture do they assume? asks Wood. As he notes, the 19-page White Hot Technical Report discusses Psychological Warfare in the following way. There is a good chance that the Russians may try to make use of the flying saucer scare by public news media and diplomatic means [sic] of a technological breakthrough in aircraft and missile development. We feel that such a disclosure would most certainly cause great embarrassment to our elected officials and to the military, not to mention the panic felt by the citizenry. To counter such a threat, it is recommended that a counterintelligence program be drawn up and held in abeyance if at such time the situation should present itself. It might be suggested that we should make a preemptive use of these objects for the purpose of psychological warfare once the true nature of these objects are known and understood. ...It would be advisable for the respective Secretaries of the Armed Forces to devise a security policy of plausible denial, if and when the public becomes aware of the reality of these objects and the interest of the military in such incidents. In conclusion, for reasons of national security and the public well being, the US must be perceived as being the top of the heap, and every effort must be made to insure that there is [sic], and never has been, a threat to the country. Wood notes that the implications of the wording of the above document are vitally important to the question of whether or not the MJ-12 documents are verifiably real, or are some form of deception: In September of 1947, top military leaders were recommending to the President that the U.S. consider using our existing crashed hardware and absolute proof of the reality of UFOs as a tool to deceive the Soviets once we figured out the technology. Then if this document is psychological warfare propaganda, why include this paragraph? It just attracts attention to the topic and makes alleged foreign intelligence analysts analyzing such a document more suspicious. Indeed, it does. And Wood elaborates further:  There is another brief explicit discussion of psychological warfare, from the 1st Annual Report: 'MAJESTIC SS&P are currently focused on Psy-op development for Cold War CI activities.' So what does this mean? We know that the National Security Council authorized an interdisciplinary Special Studies group consisting of Army, Navy, Air Force and CIA with their May 5, 1948 directive. We also know that President Truman made the decision to establish the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) on April 4, 1951. This further relates to UFOs when you consider who was on the PSB:  Secretary of the Army, the Honorable Kenneth Royall;  Secretary of War, the Honorable Robert Patterson;  Assistant Secretary of the Army, the Honorable Gordon Gray;  Chief of Staff & General of the Army, Dwight D. Eisenhower;  Lt. General Albert C. Wedemeyer;  Brigadier General Robert McClure;  Lt. General J. Lawton Collins;  Major General Charles Bolte;  Undersecretary of War, the Honorable William Draper;  Major General Stephen Chamberlain, USA (G-2). As Wood makes clear: Many of these people are deeply involved with MAJESTIC-12 according to other documents. Note the similarity of panel personnel between the November 1952 Eisenhower Briefing Document and the 1st Annual Report; the team distribution has the same interagency structure. Is this a coincidence, standard procedure or is it the same MAJESTIC committee just six years later? What is the mission of'Cold War CI activities' as it relates to UFOs? Who is the target and what are the objectives? The second explicit mention of psychological warfare is from the 'Annual Report' on Majestic, page 10, Annex B, point 10: 'MAJCOM-1 with the assistance of the Panel persuades the President to establish a Psychological Strategy Board on 4 April 1951.' This is an obscure fact that the Psychological Strategy Board was authorized on April 4, 1951. To discover this would take intense digging nowadays and would be known to only a few insiders in 1951. This is powerful evidence in favor of Majestic document authenticity. However, following the disinformation theory, why attract attention to the fact (verifiable and known today) that you had established a very secret board with staff, plans, and very likely operational capabilities to mislead the enemy? Is it logical to believe that if the 1st Annual Report document was a part of psychological warfare deception that it would highlight that fact to the target of such a deception? I don't think so. In addition to the examples above, here is more evidence that such a deception is not a factor. Why would the following paragraph be included if the goal were to deceive? 'Based on what is known of the technology and intelligence of the visitors, it is fairly certain there will be other sightings and encounters of a spectacular nature.' As Wood reasonably asks: Wouldn't it be more logical to change phrases to leave the impression that the July 1947 events were a random miracle that will likely never happen again? That way the Soviets would pay less attention to the event. Another example is the Majestic mention of the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project. The highly classified NEPA project, an actual initiative and logical extension of the Manhattan project, was to provide the U.S. with an atomic-powered aircraft. Why specifically mention it in these documents, if they were designed to be 'leaked,' and encourage, and accelerate, spy activities and intelligence collection around atomic airplanes? This could be viewed as a far more important secret to keep than telling the Soviets about crashed flying saucers; yet, the statements in the documents are not deceptive (the NEPA initiative was real) and would encourage espionage. Wood then turns his attention to one of the most critical questions of all: Is there any evidence of official governmental falsification in relation to UFOs? His answer to this question follows:  Speculation about UFOs could offer a powerful tool to the military and intelligence communities. Early on, as evidenced from official declassified documents NASA was ordered by President Kennedy to communicate clearly to the Soviets about known and 'unknown' (UFO) aircraft and spacecraft. Some have made the obvious suggestion that we could build military or intelligence craft that 'look like' UFOs and will thus be ignored, since it is understood that modern defense systems are looking for specific anticipated targets with established 'signatures,' not 'erratic' UFOs. There is a recently declassified top-secret technical report called Snowbird that describes a Mach 3 single seat UFO that was written in 1955. It would be logical to assume that other more modern craft have been made. In relation to documents in Ufology, to date, there has not been a single, clear, classified psychological warfare product. The Majestic documents fail the basic tests as a psychological warfare activity. But what of Wood's next question: Have The Skeptics Raised Any Valid Objections Or Evidence? He reveals: A paper, from an anonymous author with unknown and unverified credentials, and titled Deceptive UFO Documents: Doubt Debate and Daunting Questions states the obvious concerning the polarizing debate in Ufology and provides no detailed evidence of deception in the Majestic documents. Take this statement for example: 'Ongoing research indicates that many, possibly all, of the so called MJ-12 UFO documents were officially fabricated as instruments of U.S. covert psychological warfare, perhaps beginning in 1950 during the most threatening period of the Korean War.' Whose research? What specifics are being alluded to? Without clear answers, this statement is simply an argument-by-assertion and is just pontificating by an unknown author. Or the critical assertion is made: 'Document examination and authentication is a science of expert opinion, and are, as other sciences, generally probabilistic; however, it is an empirical and not a statistical science.' To the contrary: document examination and authentication is not a matter of expert opinion according to Dr. James Black, 30-year practitioner in document forensics and past president of the questioned documents professional organization but is a matter of applying key straightforward tests and presenting a logical set of evidence."

Experts in artificial intelligence believe we are just a few years away from having computers that will claim to be conscious in some manner, and will seem like they are, whatever the nature of that consciousness may truly be. Then there is the matter of nanotechnology and quantum computing, the results of which are expected to transform our world even more completely than the internet revolution already has. In other words, humanity is in the process of reinventing itself. Any observing intelligence must be well aware that we are poised, knowingly or not, to leap into their world. We have probably been there all along, only asleep. Now we are about to wake up."

        "text_source": "Virtually every abductee receives information about the destruction of the earth's ecosystem and feels compelled to do something about it. But, as we have seen in the cases presented here, this is not received merely cognitively, like a lecture. Abductees experience powerful images of vast destruction, with the collapse of governmental and economic infrastructures and the total pollution and desertification of the planet. This knowledge is felt profoundly in their bodies, and I have been greatly moved as they sob on the couch and experience heartache so intense that they can barely bring themselves to speak of it. It is the kind of knowledge that must be translated into action. Writer and futurist Jean Houston, at the Congress of the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in September 1993, commented that all myths begin with a form of betrayal. Perhaps the human betrayal of the earth itself is giving rise to a new myth of interspecies relationship and creation. THE HYBRID \"PROGRAM\" The pioneering work of Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs has shown what is amply corroborated in my cases, namely that the abduction phenomenon is in some central way involved in a breeding program that results in the creation of alien/human hybrid offspring. But we must be cautious not to assume that these phenomena are taking place literally in our familiar material reality. Comparing the experiences of various abductees, they report that during the abductions sperm are forcibly taken from men and ova from women, after which this germ plasm is brought together and altered. This process is called \"genetic\" by abductees and investigators, but we have no actual evidence of this. The altered conceptus is reinserted in the uterus during a subsequent abduction, allowed to gestate for some weeks, and then removed. After this the hybrid fetuses are \"incubated\" in tanks or cylinders (as shown in Catherine's case and drawing) until the fetuses are old enough to live outside of them in some sort of room on the ships. Periodically the abductee mothers and fathers are brought to see the hybrid offspring and encouraged to hold and love them, which is one of the most disturbing aspects of the whole process. For the abductees are naturally filled with conflict at the prospect of forming a deep bond with an odd offspring that they can only see rarely at the pleasure of the alien beings. Despite their resentment of the forced and traumatic nature of this process, virtually all the abductees with whom I have worked come to accept their participation in this program. I believe that \"identification with the aggressor,\" as is sometimes suggested, is a much too simple explanation of the abductees' attitude toward the hybrid process. Many men and women come to feel, despite their anger, that they are taking part-even that they have chosen to participate-in a process that is life creating and life-giving."

        "text_source": "It was determined to be a genuine formation (that is, not manmade) by the renowned biophysicist William Levengood, who found distinct and measurable cellular changes in plants taken from the formation. Other evidence pointing to its authenticity included no damage to the plants or soil compression; no tracks to vital construction points; and very complex braiding of plants in the outer ring where numerous circles were positioned, and which was determined to be extremely difficult, if not impossible for humans to achieve without leaving evidence of their presence. Also, two eminent scientists, Gerald Hawkins and Robert Hadley, both confirmed that the scaling and placement of the planets within the crop formation were extraordinarily accurate and that it was a very precise replica of our solar system. Also, I personally had extensive discussions with members of the only organized group of counterfeit circlemakers working at that time (to my knowledge) and none of them claimed responsibility for the formation, nor knowledge of who else could have made it. Frozen in time is our solar system, with the Earth missing from its orbit. This formation has a history, and a profound meaning. The first thing this crop pattern does is call attention to Earth's empty orbit. When we also consider that this celestial configuration is what the solar system will look like in approximately 30 years, and again in 100 years, the question arises: Are we being sent a message? Is the universe telling us of our possible fate? Are we being warned that if we continue on the reckless, damaging path we are on, then the future of mankind is at risk? When Marcus Thompson, the writer and director of the crop circle\u2013themed movie A Place to Stay, came to me to discuss his project, I suggested that he should include this solar system design in the film. I felt that the formation, and its possible message was important enough to replicate precisely, and include within the storyline of the movie. Marcus was including a powerful environmental message in the film, and I felt that this design would contribute to his mission. He agreed, and I supplied aerial photographs (including the one on the cover of this book) to his production team to assist them in their construction work. I asked Matthew Williams and his team to create the solar system formation in the fields. The formation was ultimately made (and is seen in the movie), and all agreed that it was a very close duplicate of the original. But that's where the similarities ended. The created formation had extreme plant damage, widespread soil compression, major errors in the geometry of the design, and it took so long to make that many of the public were able to see the half-finished pattern in broad daylight. Even though we provided the measurements, ratios, and scaling data to the construction team, they were still unable to complete it in one night and, when it was finished, it was so obviously manmade, that it reminded us even more so of the truly amazing nature of the spontaneous, authentic formation. All our research convinced us that the original formation was authentic. Its possible message struck a chord with all of us, and thus, my recommendation that it appear in the movie, and my decision to highlight it on the cover of Crop Circles: Signs of Contact."

        "text_source": "Dr. Jacobs's work covers a broad range of phenomena associated with UFO encounters. His focus, however, is upon the structure of the abduction experience itself. In case after case he demonstrates a pattern that is consistent-even in minute details and specific elements that are not available in the mass media-among individuals who have had no opportunity to communicate their experiences to one another. This pattern consists of what Jacobs calls primary experiences (physical examination, staring, and urological and gynecological procedures); secondary experiences (machine examination, visualization, and child presentation); and ancillary experiences consisting of various other physical phenomena, mental displays, and sexually related activities. At the heart of the abduction process there appears to be some sort of complex reproductive enterprise involving the conception, gestation, or incubation of human or alien-human hybrid babies. In Jacobs's words, the focus of the abduction is the production of children. Another investigator might place greater emphasis upon phenomena that Dr. Jacobs regards as less central, such as the visualizations of planetary destruction and their impact upon the consciousness of abductees. But whatever the emphasis or interpretation of these data, Jacobs's work has given us a solid foundation of carefully documented experience upon which investigators can now build as we add to our knowledge and explore further the meaning of this puzzling and disturbing matter. Through his meticulous documentation of the structure and content of the UFO abduction phenomenon, Dr. Jacobs has deepened the mystery that lies before us while at the same time bringing us closer to some form of understanding. He has made clear that we are dealing with a phenomenon that has a hard edge, a huge, strange interspecies or interbeing breeding program that has invaded our physical reality and is affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people and perhaps in some way the consciousness of the entire planet. Jacobs has given us no explanation, but he has set forth explicitly the phenomena for which any theory must account. Among ufologists and abduction researchers, explanations have generally fallen into psychosocial (or cultural) and extraterrestrial categories. Psychosocial hypotheses, at least in the Western materialist sense, are difficult to take seriously. For unless we are willing to extend our notions of the powers of the psyche to include the creation of cuts, scars, hemorrhages, and bruises, the simultaneous production of highly elaborate and traumatic experiences similar to one another in minute detail among individuals who have not communicated with one another, and all of the physical phenomena associated with the UFOs themselves, such explanations appear quite inadequate. At the same time a literalist extraterrestrial hypothesis must account for the relative paucity of solid physical information-the lack of photographs of the beings, for example-and the virtually insurmountable problems related to accounting for the location, origins, and lives of the aliens themselves within the framework of the physical laws of our space/time universe. This last frustration has led some ufologists to posit a multiverse and the intrusion into our familiar reality of other dimensions or forces outside of the known physical universe. Others have turned to alternative notions of the nature of the cosmos, more familiar to Eastern religions and philosophy, that depict the universe and all its realities as a vast play of consciousness with physical manifestations. My own work with abductees has impressed me with the powerful dimension of personal growth that accompanies the traumatic experiences that David Jacobs so accurately describes, especially when these people receive appropriate help in exploring their abduction histories. An intense concern for the planet's survival and a powerful ecological consciousness seem to develop for many abductees. Whether this is a specific element, or even purpose, of the abduction enterprise or an inadvertent by-product of integrating a self-destroying traumatic narrative remains to be explored. For me and other investigators, abduction research has had a shattering impact on our views of the nature of the cosmos. This has led me to offer at least a parable, if not a theory, to illuminate what is going on. Virtually all peoples throughout history, with the exception of the Western culture of the Newtonian/Cartesian era, have experienced the universe as possessing some sort of intelligence or consciousness in which human beings participate with other animate beings and inanimate things in an enterprise that has meaning, purpose, and direction, however unfathomable these may be. In the West, we seem, for reasons perhaps as mysterious as the abduction phenomenon itself, to have cut ourselves off almost totally from awareness of any form of higher intelligence. But let us suppose that such an intelligence did exist, and, what is more, that it was not indifferent to the fate of the Earth, regarding its life forms and transcendent beauty as one of its better or more advanced creations. And let us imagine that the imbalance created by the overgrowth of certain human faculties, a kind of technodestructive and fear-driven acquisitiveness, were diagnosed (perceived? felt?-we really do not know how the divinity might experience itself and its creation) as the basic problem. What could be done as a corrective? The two natural approaches of which we can conceive would be the genetic and the environmental. Is it possible that through a vast hybridization program affecting countless numbers of people, and a simultaneous invasion of our consciousness with transforming images of our selfdestruction, an effort is being made to place the planet under a kind of receivership? This would not necessarily be for our good if this planet, on which humankind has broken the harmony of being, does not exist just for our pleasure, but in order to arrest the destruction of life and to make possible the further evolution of consciousness or whatever the anima mundi has in store. I do not say that this is true or offer it as a theory. I would merely suggest that if we could allow ourselves to reintroduce the possibility of a higher intelligence into the universe, and experience the numinous mystery of creation, this scenario is consistent with the facts of the abduction phenomenon. David Jacobs has written in this book, No significant body of thought has come about that presents strong evidence that anything else is happening other than what the abductees have stated. He has made his case well and has greatly enriched our knowledge of what the abductees have to tell of their experiences. We must now go on from here."

        "text_source": "A double-standard exists today regarding the idea of UFOs and extra-terrestrial life. Mainstream science embraces the idea that life may exist elsewhere in the universe. In fact, that idea is the driving force currently behind many unmanned space missions. In addition, there are various SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) programs currently active. These are based on the premise that if there is life elsewhere in the universe, perhaps they have used radio waves or similar communication at one time or another. If so, then we can use radio telescopes to listen for these non-random electro-magnetic patterns against the general background noise of the universe. This concept is certainly a valid and noble one. I personally encourage their efforts. However, whereas SETI projects are held in high regard and garner scientific recognition; UFO research is relegated to the fringe element. SETI programs in one form or another have been active for decades going back to the 1960s. Yet these programs have nothing to show for their efforts. No signals have yet been detected that confirm intelligent life in the universe. I must emphasize, this should not be construed as a rationale for closure of such projects. Again, I support their continued endeavors with the hope of eventual success. Conversely, despite decades of valid case material, science and the media to a large extent have ignored or ridiculed the UFO subject matter and those associated with it. This is ironic, considering at the core of it all, we are all striving for the same thing \u2013 confirmation of intelligent life beyond our own. We share the dream if not the methodology. But there exists a rift between these two groups that is predicated on the fundamental notion of where extraterrestrial life exists. SETI groups operate under the notion that intelligent life could exist out there in the universe, but they couldn't possibly be visiting Earth. UFO researchers concede that intelligent life could exist in the universe, but add that it is also a distinct possibility those same intelligences could be monitoring/visiting our planet given the age of the universe relative to that of Earth's. As previously discussed, extra-terrestrial life could exist and be thousands or millions of years ahead of us in technology. We simply cannot ignore this possibility. I have worked in the medical field for fifteen years and have seen an ever-growing trend towards multi-disciplinary approaches towards remedying disease states and illnesses. Rather than taking a one prong approach to curing a patient; physicians are looking at various treatment modalities to be done in conjunction with one another. Why can't we utilize this same philosophy regarding the study of extra-terrestrial life? Why can't we have SETI programs that have public/private funding as well as UFO research that can be equally supported? Why don't we actively pursue both avenues of research and hold them in equally high regard? It is just a thought. Where we stand today in reference to triangular UFOs and the UFO subject as a whole is just a stepping stone in our examination of this phenomenon. Hopefully, this book serves a small role in gaining insights and understanding into the mystery by focusing specifically on one particular subgroup of UFOs. Questions remain as to the relationship, if any, of these triangular UFOs relative to the others of varying description. Each person who reviews this material can make their own conclusions. However, at the very least, we must acknowledge the possibility of a tangible reality behind this mystery. Using the field of archaeology as an analogy, the age of humankind on this planet continues to be dated earlier into antiquity as we discover new fossil evidence. The field of UFOlogy is no different. As new information comes to the surface, we will need to examine the information with a critical eye and determine its validity. In addition, such information may force us to re-examine previously-held ideas and beliefs concerning the subject matter. Until hard UFO evidence is presented for the general public's consumption (e.g., actual UFO or parts thereof), this mystery will continue. However, the thirst for understanding is there and will continue to fuel the investigations and research until the day when a better understanding is made of this most intriguing phenomenon."

        "text_source": "In sum, the purely physical or biological aspect of the abduction phenomenon seems to have to do with some sort of genetic or quasi-genetic engineering for the purpose of creating human-alien hybrid offspring. We have no evidence of alien-induced genetic alteration in the strictly biological sense, although it is possible that this has occurred. INFORMATION AND THE ALTERATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS The other important, related aspect of the abduction phenomenon has to do with the provision of information and the alteration of consciousness of the abductees. This is not a purely cognitive process, but one that reaches deeply into the emotional and spiritual lives of the experiencers, profoundly changing their perceptions of themselves, the world, and their place in it. This information concerns the fate of the earth and human responsibility for the destructive activities that are taking place on it. It is conveyed by the direct mind-to-mind telepathic communication referred to above and through powerful images shown on television monitor-like screens on the ships themselves. The information may begin to be conveyed when the abductees are children or adolescents (see Arthur, chapter 15, and Ed, chapter 3), but its implications are not fully understood until much later. The investigator seems to play an important part in enabling the abductee to bring forth and realize the significance of the information they have been receiving during abductions that have been taking place over many years. Scenes of the earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, vast panoramas of lifeless polluted landscapes and waters, and apocalyptic images of giant earthquakes, firestorms, floods, and even fractures of the planet itself are shown by the aliens. These are powerfully disturbing to the abductees, who tend to experience them as literally predictive of the future of the planet. Some abductees are given assignments in this future holocaust as it is displayed, such as to feed the survivors, or are told, as in the prophetic books of the Bible, that some will perish while others will be taken to another place to participate in the evolution of life in the universe. Some abduction researchers believe that these images are not shown for the purpose of altering the course of the planet's history in a positive way. Rather, they maintain, the beings are studying the experiencers' reactions and are deceiving them into believing that they are concerned with our fate while they proceed to take over our planet, their own having presumably been destroyed by an apocalypse of science and technology similar to the fate that might befall us (various personal communications 1990-93; also Scott, chapter 5). They argue further that if the aliens were truly concerned with our well-being they would manifest themselves more forthrightly and intervene directly in our affairs in order to make things better. Abduction experiencers report that the aliens themselves, when confronted with this issue, say that we are not ready to acknowledge their existence, and would treat them aggressively as an enemy as we do anyone or anything different from ourselves that we do not understand. But most importantly, the aliens say, their methods are different. Some abductees report that the aliens do not wish to bring about change through coercion but rather through a change of consciousness that would lead to our choosing a different course. Some abductees receive information of battles for the fate of the earth and the control of the human mind, between two or more groups of beings, some of which are more evolved or \"good,\" while others are less evolved or \"evil.\" The abductees usually report fewer details of their return to Earth than they do of their abduction. Usually they are returned to the bed or car from which they were taken, but sometimes \"mistakes\" are made. They may be returned quite a distance, or even miles, away from their home. This is rare, and I have seen no cases of this kind, although Budd Hopkins has told me of such instances. Smaller mistakes are more common, such as landing the experiencer facing in the wrong direction on the bed, with his or her pajamas on backwards or inside out, or with certain garments or jewelry missing. Sometimes the aliens seem to be making a point, or a certain humor is involved. One two-year-old among my cases was tucked into his bed tightly after an abduction, which the parents say that neither they nor his older sister had done; he, of course, was incapable of doing this. Hopkins tells of a case where two abductees were returned to the wrong cars. As they drove along the highway the drivers recognized each other's cars."

        "text_source": "8.3.6 Extraterrestrial Hypotheses A large number of people today are convinced that UFOs are piloted by intelligent beings who have come from a very remote part of the universe and are tasked with watching us and even initiating contact with us. As appealing as they may be. these hypotheses run up against all sorts of huge difficulties. The hypothetical Martians only recently disappeared from the realm of possibility, and apart from earth, the solar system appears to be totally unable to have produced organized life and even more unable to have produced an advanced civilization. It is therefore necessary to look farther, to the stars, but the closest star is already one hundred million times further away than the moon. The only contacts that we may try to establish from such distances at present are radio contacts. Astronomers have attempted contacts via message transmission and radio listening in the \"SETI\" and \"MEGASETI\" programs. Although some enthusiasts have suggested futuristic ideas to \"bypass\" the vast expanse, such as, for example, the use of \"black holes,\" the crossing of interstellar distances by possible extraterrestrials has elicited much skepticism and the majority of astronomers reiterate that \"to date there has been no UFO case that is sufficiently well established to imply that it came from an extraterrestrial civilization. \" Two professional astronomers, Jean-Claude Ribes and Guy Monnet, have, however, proposed a scenario in our future in space that includes plausible interstellar voyages. In this scenario, which is summarized in Appendix 4, they envision the establishment of large communities in verdant \"islands in space, \" enormous artificial structures orbiting the earth, as described by the physicist O'Neill, and even inside large asteroids,-where an abundance of different materials, including water and oxygen, as well as ready protection against meteorites and cosmic radiation, are found. Later on, when our descendants have mastered the production, storage and use of antimatter as energy, they will utilize it to propel some of their habitats to another solar system. They will settle in an asteroid belt, start families there, and then visit the planets of the receiving system aboard craft that are perceived by any possible natives the same way we perceive UFOs today. This scenario, which in essence relies only on laws of physics that are currently well accepted, gives the extraterrestrial hypothesis a certain degree of plausibility; it is possible to imagine thai a civilization that came from somewhere else colonized the region of our asteroid belt and used it as a staging base to our planet. Current progress in the conquest of space and physics reinforces this idea. We should point out that some people envisage another hypothesis, which is much debated: the UFOs do belong to a civilization located in the asteroid belt, but this civilization itself comes from our planet. Older than any known terrestrial civilizations and highly advanced, it supposedly disappeared from earth (nuclear war, radioactivity, pollution, etc.) but resettled in the solar system. Both hypotheses have to their credit the fact that they place the UFO problem outside the realm of the paranormal and promote thought about the future of our planet."

        "text_source": "4.1 The Gaia Theory: Plight, Warnings, and Pleas We begin with the theory that Mother Earth herself is actually involved in some way in the construction of crop circles. This theory suggests that the living Earth is communicating through natural energies that can be glimpsed in the complex grid of alignments of sacred sights and areas of paranormal influence around the world known as ley lines. This theory is based on the Gaia Theory, which was first hypothesized in 1970 by the scientist Timothy Zell, and expanded and refined by the British chemist James Lovelock and U.S. microbiologist Lynn Margulis in 1972. In 1979, Lovelock wrote the seminal book, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, which profoundly changed the way scientists, as well as ordinary people, looked at life on earth, and the life of the earth. Is the earth alive? Is the planet a functioning life-form that breathes, reproduces, and responds to threats by complex biochemical self-defense mechanisms? And if the answers to these questions are yes, can crop circles be a conscious- or, at the least, autonomic-response to atrocities committed against the planet by man and all our endeavors? And again, if the answer to the question of whether or not the earth is a living entity is yes, is it possible for the earth to die? What would be the fate of mankind and all the other lifeforms inhabiting this blue planet if that should happen? The Gaia Theory proposes that our planet is not simply a mass of lifeless rock flying through space; not simply a lucky accident in the cosmic scheme of things. In 1929, Russian scientist V. I. Vernadsky foreshadowed the development of the Gaia Theory: Life appears as a great, permanent and continuous infringer on the chemical dead-hardness of our planet's surface\u2026.Life therefore is not an external and accidental development on the terrestrial surface. Rather, it is intimately related to the constitution of the Earth's crust, forms part of its mechanism, and performs in this mechanism functions of paramount importance, without which it would not be able to exist. Is the living planet earth having problems with the support mechanisms that sustain her? From David Orrell's essay, Gaia Theory: Science of the Living Earth 2: Three billion years ago, bacteria and photosynthetic algae started to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, producing oxygen as a waste product. Over enormous time periods, this process changed the chemical content of the atmosphere- to the point where organisms began to suffer from oxygen poisoning! The situation was only relieved with the advent of organisms powered by aerobic consumption. Orrell also reminds us that the heat of the sun has increased by almost 25 percent since life began on Earth, and yet the atmospheric temperature has remained approximately the same. How has the earth compensated for such a significant increase in heat, and kept the temperature within the ideal range for all lifeforms on the planet? Lovelock and Margulis discovered a number of regulatory processes that they described as feedback loops which, in effect, served to cool the planet. One example is the cycle in which soil bacteria removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Soil bacteria is more active in hotter temperatures, so as the sun's heat increased over the eons, soil bacteria increased their activity, the net result of which was a continuous cooling of the planet. Life responded to a threat by adapting its own biochemical processes as a defense mechanism. If the earth is a living organism, crop circles may be a response to injury. Much the way the human body responds to a wound by exhibiting a welt, or a bruise, or by bleeding (and later, scarring), can the earth be responding to industrial and automotive pollution and other environmental insults and assaults by exhibiting welts or bruises in the form of crop formations? The Gaia Theory is one explanation for the phenomenon. I find great merit in the Gaia Theory and believe that even if it does not ultimately explain the crop circle phenomenon, it makes an important contribution towards educating the public and making us all more environmentally conscious. One of my colleagues recently suggested to me that the crop circle hoaxers, along with those who fixate on what percentage of crop formations are fakes and what percentage are real, are completely missing my point. He believes that my environmental concerns are often overlooked in lieu of an obsession with the numbers. I understand his point, and I agree that oftentimes my environmental message takes a back seat to the paranormal aura persistently attached to the crop circle phenomenon. I think that our attention should be on our wounded planet, and I think that the crop circles may be a way for nature, or some unknown intelligence, to redirect our focus back to the environment-where it used to be by all peoples in the pretechnology eras. In those days, there was a direct link between the environment and life; people knew it, and they respected this. The weather, the land, the animals, the crops, the trees, the waters-all were integral components of survival. Technology has moved modern man several degrees of separation away from this way of life. When there are always loaves of bread on the grocery store shelves-loaves that have been baked, sliced, packaged, and dated for freshness- it is very easy to forget that before the final product of the loaf of bread reached you, cereal crops had to be grown, harvested, ground, baked, and shipped to the baker. Crop circles appear in plants that will be used for food. This is quite blatant: Look at these beautiful designs; they are in fields of crops; you will one day eat these crops. Pay attention to that which sustains life."

I have discussed already some of the reasons why the reality of the abduction phenomenon has been so difficult for our culture to accept-the material and philosophical vested interests, for example, attached to the Western worldview. But I believe there is a core belief in our culture that is violated by the alien abduction phenomenon, namely the total separation of the spirit and the . physical world. We have made that gulf inviolate, relegating to religion the spirit (subjective) world and assigning to science the material (objective) domain. We simply do not know what to do with a phenomenon that crosses that seemingly inviolable barrier. It shocks the foundations of our belief structure. Our minds have no place to put such a thing. The Dalai Lama once pointed out that the devastation of the planet's ecology was destroying not only the habitat of plants and animals but the realms in which the spirits reside as well. Perhaps this has left them no choice but to manifest in our world, to appear to us in the only \"language\" that remains to us, the language of the physical World. In the context of the planet's crisis they have had no choice, but must find some way, however difficult, to come to us. Perhaps our consciousness has become so atrophied that we are simply unable, on our own, to be open to the spirit world. Could it be that the intense resistance with which the alien abduction phenomenon is sometimes met could be related to the shock it brings to our carefully crafted psychological boundaries, reopening us to a world from which we have distanced ourselves, reanimating those senses whereby we might again know worlds 1 beyond the manifest physical reality? Perhaps we have created the spiritual conditions that have made this necessary."

The terminology and stuff in between is immaterial.\" He reflected with awe upon the \"unbelievable\" technology he had learned from his alien encounters, especially the \"flood of information\" he has received about how they heal. \"I've got notebooks full of this stuff,\" Paul said, \"and it's very solid.\" A few days later another abductee, Julia, a young woman with whom I have been working for nearly three years, called me and spoke about Paul, whom she had met for the first time in our support group. Although they had not known each other \"on Earth,\" she felt that she knew him very well from meetings in the ships (it is very common for abductees to report that they have seen or been with other abductees who they know on the ships). She spoke of Paul's \"overpowering\" personality, which \"exudes love.\" He is \"rock solid,\" she said, and very \"centered.\" In the environment of the ship Paul has a \"presence\" and a power similar in quality to \"my doctor\"-i.e., the principal alien figure in her abductions-or to that of any of the alien beings. In particular, Julia said, Paul has great gifts as a healer, and teaches people like herself to \"pull despair and hurt from people.\" He does seem to her and others to have a great ability to carry the pain of people's suffering and to purge them of i4 especially with the use of his hands.

DISCUSSION Paul's case is illustrative of an increasing number of abductees who are not focused so much on the traumatic nature of their experiences but instead are seeking to communicate information that they feel they have received during their experienced encounters with the alien beings. Our two relaxation sessions included traumatic material, especially the shock of helplessness and the lacerating procedure done to his leg, but these are of less interest to Paul than accessing the knowledge he has received during his abduction experiences. This information is concerned with such matters as hum.an fear and destructiveness, our resistance to change, the necessity of heart .opening and the transformative power of love, space transporting, healing technologies he says he has learned from the aliens, the nature of consciousness (especially as the primal source of creation), and Paul's dual human/alien identity and role as a healer and a bridge between the two worlds. A central theme in Paul's material is the extreme and unrelenting quality of human destructiveness, which, although based on fear, remains bewildering to the aliens themselves. It appears to the aliens, he says, as if we have deliberately chosen death over life, and their experiments are in part an effort to understand our perverse, stubborn ways as well as a kind of intervention to move us along the path from destruction toward creation. It is difficult to know how to evaluate the information that Paul has received. In the first place, as he himself says, it is hard to accept the power and knowledge of, let alone experience as \"gurus,\" creatures such as these who are so odd in appearance and \"shatter\" our notions of reality. For Paul, like all of us who are exposed directly or indirectly to this phenomenon, the first task has been to accept the fact of his own experience. Furthermore, the accounts that he provides sometimes altogether defy space/time reality. Such space/time traveling might make sense by conceiving of consciousness as a kind of hologram of universal sourcefulness which can create matter and form itself and to which Paul, and each of us potentially, has access if we can open and \"let go\" as called for into this primal universal information or energy fabric. Much of the material of Paul's sessions was concerned with the form and identity-creating power of consciousness and the compelling necessity of opening ourselves to its infinite qualities. What made Paul's communications so compelling and persuasive was the intensity of feeling and bodily movement and sensation that accompanied each new thought. In working with him it was as if the hypnotist's role was to facilitate Paul's access to knowledge that was stored within him and that powerfully affected his body as it moved into consciousness and could then be communicated. The idea of consciousness as an infinite source of energy and form to which each being has access makes it perhaps inappropriate to consider each communication of Paul's in terms of whether it is literally factual or concretely \"happened\" in linear space/time terms. I appreciate that this will not satisfy anyone who would still hold to a view of reality that is limited to the physical four-dimensional universe. On the other hand, there may be some value in challenging our restricted epistemology and expanding our criteria for evaluating information to include the power or intensity with which something is felt and communicated and the potential utility the knowledge may have in relation to our contemporary dilemmas.Applying these criteria, there is little doubt that Paul experienced the information that carne to him in our sessions as having great power, as did those of us (Pam and myself) who received it. Furthermore, the relentless messages of the need for change, of the necessity of human mind and heart opening, and of the catastrophic consequences of our having mistaken the \"shell\" of our defensiveness for the whole of human identity-messages which comprise the essence of the information that Paul has received and imparted-are all communications of great practical value in the context of the present global crisis. Finally, there is the question of Paul himself and my role in his development and personal opening. Those who know him outside of the therapeutic setting, such as Pam, Julia, and other abductees, all testify to his extraordinary intuitive and healing abilities. He has come to me to enable him to free his powers from the restrictions of the suppression (a word he used both in relation to his mother's uneasiness in the face of his intelligence and abilities and his former therapist's inability to deal with the abductionrelated material) that was the result of several sets of forces. These include the repression of the material locked within him (an adaptive response when one considers their intensity, Paul's need to function normally in everyday reality, and the absence of a supportive context in which it could be safe to open himself to such unusual information), the ontologically shattering nature of the information itself, and the sheer power of the energies involved, which required the creation of a strongly supportive and trusting context before Paul could allow himself to bring forth what was held within. Paul experiences himself as a bridge between two worlds . He feels deeply that he has both a human and an alien identity. The task of integrating these two basic dimensions of himself-a challenge that many abductees who experience this double life must face-is formidable and is a central aspect of our work. For Paul, like other \u00b7abductees who feel that they have accessed i:he source of creative energy in the cosmos, their human identity and participation is intensely painful, especially in the face of the destructive institutions or life systems we have created. ''Home\" for him, as it is for many abductees, is on the ship or with \"them.\" Yet at the same time Paul feels strongly that he has been given, or chosen, a role on Earth to contribute, as an example in his own being of openness and love, to the evolution and transformation of human consciousness."

When the frog from the well saw the ocean, it was such a shock that his head just exploded into pieces. -Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying When we look back our lives seem to possess a coherence, and even a progression, of which we were hardly aware as events unfolded. When the UFO abduction phenomenon flrst came to my attention, my curiosity was aroused, and I had a sense that something unusual was happening within me. But I had little notion of the extent to which my explorations would open my consciousness to vast mysteries and uncertainties. And I did not foresee how fundamentally challenged the view of the world in which I had been raised would be. Each of the thirteen people whose cases are described in this book-indeed each of the seventy-six abductees with whom I have worked-tells a unique story. The injdividual differences can probably be accounted for on the basis of the diverse personalities of the experiencers and the varieties of circumstances within the abductions themselves. But what I have found to be so extraordinary from the beginning of my study has been the readily identifiable patterns that emerge when the case narratives are examined carefully. It may be argued that it is my own mind that has created this coherence, and that I have shaped and interpreted data in line with a structure that I already have in mind. In response to this criticism, I can only state that the abduction phenomenon was, in the beginning, as unbelievable to me as it is to any skeptic and that I have tried to be aware of any inclination to form new beliefs and convictions that might take the place of previous ones that have been so radically \u00b7called into question. One of the reasons I chose to include so many cases in such great detail is my desire to weave a tapestry of sufficient richness to give readers the opportunity to make their own judgments about the abduction phenomenon. I cannot say that the cases selected have been \"typical,\" because I do not know what a typical case would be, or even that there is such a thing as a typical case. I do believe, however, that the cases I have discussed are illustrative of the range of phenomena that characterize abduction experiences. There are aspects of UFO abductions that do not obey the physical laws of the universe as we have known them. Some of the phenomena might be understood at some future time through great advances in physics. But others, such as the capacity abductees like Paul discover to move their consciousness through space and time, require another ontological paradigm. I do not expect that the material presented in this book will have much impact on the minds of those who believe that the laws of physics as encompassed by the Newtonian/Einsteinian system are the full definition of reality. I hope, however, that the data contained here is of sufficient power and solidity to enable those who are open to expanding their view of possible realities to consider that the world might contain forces and intelligences of which we have hardly allowed ourselves to dream. \"When I turn the lights out at night, this has been the show for the past week. I can see it with my eyes closed as well as open.\" -Anne (see page 403)  WAYS OF KNOWING: METHODOLOGY In physics, psychology, and other fields the data we obtain is a function of the way we have gone about the task of gaining information. In my own discipline of depth psychology, Freud and his followers, using their insights into the contents and structure of the human unconscious gained through the analysis of dreamsquite overlooked in the rationalist neuropsychology of his timederived the application of hypnosis in medical psychology and the method of free association. The development of new ways of knowing requires, however, something more than the application of different technologies or tools. Rather, an expanded epistemology, especially in psychology, may demand the legitimization (or relegitimization) of neglected aspects of ourselves as instruments of knowing. Although psychoanalysis has been responsible for great advances in our knowledge of human experience and the depths and structure of the psyche, it has retained as a way of knowing a good deal of the dualistic, subject/object split that characterizes Western empirical science, including psychology. The patient or client is generally regarded as someone with a problem, separate from the therapist/investigator; the patient is to be helped or studied. Indeed, Freud eventually turned away from hypnosis as a way of working with his patients in part because of the subjective bias it seemed to introduce into the therapeutic process (Mack 1993) rather than recognizing the inherent intersubjectivity of psychodynamic clinical work (Stolorow 1992) and continuing to struggle with the demand for analytic rigor that this requires. Alternative therapies and investigations of human consciousness appear to share an expanded use of the psyche as part of the exploratory process. The feelings and spirit of the facilitator in alternative therapeutic situations, as well as his or her rational mind and observational skills, are a vital aspect of the therapeutic or investigative method. This expanded use of the self relies on empathy and is, in essence, intersubjective. Within this framework hypnosis, shamanic journeys, meditation, Grof breathwork, vision quests, and other modalities, which are called in the West \"nonordinary\" states of consciousness, become natural investigative allies. For they involve, by definition, the opening of the psyche to the deeper realms that lie behind the rational or observing mind. In the end, of course, the rational intellect is essential for understanding and integrating the data obtained through the fuller use of consciousness as an investigative tool. But along the waywe-as investigators or readers-must open ourselves through this expanded way of knowing to whatever the patient or subject may report to be his or her experience. It is perhaps understandable, therefore, that I would have, in effect, \"stumbled\" upon the UFO abduction phenomenon and that I was then more or less prepared to take on its investigation in the context of my training in the Grof holotropic breathwork method (see chapter I ), which relies upon the use of the whole selfmind, body, and soul-in the exploration of unconscious human experience. In working with abductees, the investigative method I have developed is basically a combination of the old and the new. In addition to standard interviews I use hypnosis, which was Freud's original \"nonordinary\" state for investigating the unconscious, modified by the use of the breath for centering and deepening the process. In my work with abductees I am fully involved, experiencing and reliving with them the world that they are calling forth from their unconscious. My whole psyche or being is engaged; naturally the rational or observing self is always present, shaping, limiting, and protecting the process. The empirical methods of Western science rely primarily on the physical senses and rational intellect for gaining knowledge, and downplay feeling and intuition. They were developed in part to avoid the subjectivity, contaJ.llination, and sheer messiness of human emotion. Yet the cost of this restricted way of knowing may be that we now learn about the physical world with pnly limited use of our faculties. In order to learn about the worlds \"beyond the veil,\" as abductees put it, we may need a different kind of consciousness. This means that the process of gaining information about abductions is, to a large degree, participatory, even \"cocreative.\" By this I do not mean that I impose beliefs of my own about the phenomenon upon the experiencers, am leading or \"coaching\" them, or even that I believe literally everything an abductee says. As much as possible my questions in the sessions derive from what has just been said, or my intuition, based on experiences in therapy not only with abductees, but hundreds of patients, about where I feel the inner experience of the abductee is going. I avoid leading questions, and abductees, in my experience, are quite difficult to lead (they all seem to feel, as Sheila said, \"I know what I saw\"). Yet, at the same time, I cannot avoid the fact that a cocreative intuitive process such as this may yield information that is in some sense the product of the intermingling or flowing together of the consciousness of the two (or more) people in the room. Something may be brought forth that was not there before in exactly the same form. Stated differently, the information gained in the sessions is not simply a remembered \"item,\" lifted out of the experiencer's consciousness like a stone from a kidney. It may represent instead a developed or evolved perception, enriched by the connection that the experiencer and the investigator have made. From a traditional dualistic perspective this might be called \"distortion\"; from a transpersonal point of view the experiencer and I may be participating in an evolution of consciousness. When we are dealing with a phenomenon like alien abductions, which manifests in the physical world but may derive from some other reality, the question of whether hypnosis (or any other nonordinary modality that can help us access realities outside of or beyond the physical world) discloses accurately what literally or factually \"happened\" may be inappropriate (see Appendix A for a fuller discussion of this matter). A more useful question would be whether the investigative method can yield information that is consistent among experiencers, carries emotional conviction, and appears to enlarge our knowledge of phenomena that are significant for the lives of the experiencers and the larger culture."

        "text_source": "-Michel de Montaigne I believe that there is an intelligence behind the creation of crop circles. It is apparent to me that intelligent design is visible in the authentic formations; the hand of an author, if you will. The placement of these designs seem purposeful to me: it is clear that they were intended to be seen, and that their beauty and fascinating geometric patterns were intended to intrigue us, and to stimulate us. This again speaks to intelligent design and deliberate purpose. Bolstering this view is the fact that there is consistent, ongoing interaction between the phenomenon and the researchers; some might say the phenomenon responds to the researchers. There have been cases involving the design and placement of formations that argue against simple coincidence. For instance, there are reports in the literature in which an identical pattern has appeared a few days after the original pattern was plowed under. Why? And what can this mean? This has only happened when a formation was destroyed before researchers had a chance to study it. Again, it is as if the intelligence behind the mystery wants to be sure that those who are paying attention receive all the information they are attempting to communicate to them. We do not know the nature of this intelligence. I have been lambasted in the past for using the word intelligence somewhat imprecisely. I was excoriated because many people interpreted my use of the word intelligence to mean aliens. Extraterrestrials. Thus, I use the word cautiously now, and when I do, I am careful to explain that intelligence can mean many things, and that I am not specifically referring to E.T. coming down and making crop circles. For instance, there is an intelligence to the human immune system. This complex biological system continually evaluates threats to the human body and, in a sense, decides when to respond to danger and attack the intruder. This type of automatic, non-human thinking goes on in varying degrees of complexity and sophistication throughout the entire spectrum of life forms. I am using this analogy vis-a-vis crop circles to illustrate that it is possible that the manifestations that we all can see- the authentic patterns and designs-could be an autonomic response from the earth, similar to the innate, and undeniably intelligent responses of the human immune system. This does not demand a conscious entity wielding the controls, so to speak. It simply reacts as a highly functioning biosystem, much like the human body, or the global ecosphere. The concept of intelligence does not always have to include use of tools and the development of language. Nature is intelligent. It reasons, it thinks, it responds. Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the 12th man to walk on the moon, believes that the universe itself is an intelligent, self-correcting entity. Intelligence does not always require consciousness. Sometimes, intelligent action is simply part and parcel of the matrix of all reality."

        "text_source": " PAINTING BY NUMBERS   It would be stating the obvious to say that in order to understand something about the crop circles we have to look at their geometry and number. The essence of the crop circles is their shape, measure, pattern and proportion \u2013 it is their very structure and language. However, to enter this world is not just to learn something about the shapes of the circles; an inadvertent but fortuitous by-product is that we also begin to learn something about the underlying patterns of life, nature and the universe beyond. The geometry of the crop circles seems to express timeless, universal constants and elements found throughout the natural world, in everything from the tiniest flower to vast star-filled galaxies, and even in the design of our own human bodies. Number is often referred to as the 'universal language' and can be understood by anyone who can count. Geometry means 'measure of the earth', and its practice is hoary with age. The need to quantify or measure area is an essential part of human culture; the demarcations of property and land boundaries are the first acts in the creation of any society. Man has observed for thousands of years the shapes, patterns and proportions which underlie the design of the natural world. The geometry of a tree or a flower is as demonstrable today as it was long ago, as are the ratios and proportions of the human body and its growth processes; geometry, it could be argued, is the world's oldest science. However, to the Ancients, geometry and number were more than quantities and scientific functions; they embodied a canon of number, form and proportion that was used to build the whole of creation. These numbers, forms and proportions were therefore divinely inspired, the building blocks and apparatus of a divine creator. The Ancients took these principles and wove them into the fabric of their societies; they used them in their temples and precincts and reproduced the same divine order in their own sanctuaries and metropolises. In his theory of The Forms, Plato wrote about an archetypal canon of number, shape and proportion upon which creation was founded. These 'forms' existed in a perfect state beyond the physical world and were known to us only by inference \u2013 or via pure reason. Another legendary Greek, Pythagoras, founded a whole philosophy of numbers based not just upon their quantities and forms, but also on the archetypal qualities that numbers can be seen to embody. Pythagoras was almost certainly not the first to associate numbers with these kinds of qualities, but it is from him that most of our modern understanding of such matters originates. The study of sacred geometry follows a symbolic creation myth, which uses geometric forms to describe the unfolding of order in space. Included in this myth are not only the numeric and geometric properties of numbers, but also their inherent meanings and functions (the second property of number). Once the basic vocabulary of this geometrical and numerical language has been grasped, it opens the door to a whole new realm of understanding shapes and patterns. Shapes, patterns and proportions also play an integral role in the human psyche; it has been suggested that we are predisposed to see underlying patterns in all things. Certainly it has been shown that shapes, spaces and designs can have a profound unconscious effect on the mind \u2013 we may even have some kind of 'intelligence of shape and harmony'. Just as with Rorschach ink blots used in psychological profiling, we have an ability to detect order and form in the seemingly haphazard. It is this skill in part which helps us make sense of the things we see, sense and feel. Perhaps we feel a special empathy with certain archetypal shapes, because we are designed using the same principles and somewhere deep inside us we sense this. Through psychology, we have become ever more aware of our patterns of behaviour and even our relationships can be likened to proportions and ratios \u2013 we often give them a form of measure by saying that some are closer and some are more distant. Cherhill, Wiltshire, England. July 1999. Wheat crop, approximately 200 feet    Crop circle designs are often about economy, efficiency and expediency. Like the best designs in nature, the measures and proportions are often self-contained, and whilst seemingly multifaceted and beautiful, they employ the most ingenious and simple solutions for achieving the desired outcome. The patterns often use self-similarity, mirroring and regeneration at varying scales, and other such principles found in nature's design book. Themes develop over a season or more, beginning with simple forms which are then developed through several formations and brought to a conclusion. This is a fascinating part of the crop circle mystery, and one which allows us to follow the thought-processes of the mysterious circle-makers."

        "text_source": "The Positives acknowledge that some abduction procedures might be painful or traumatic, but they liken the experiences to going to a dentist, where one endures shortterm pain for long-term health. They look past fear because the frightened or traumatized abductees fail to understand the aliens' hidden benevolent motivations. Once the \"experiencers\" grasp the big picture, they will understand that temporary fear and pain are an insignificant price to pay for the enormous rewards they will reap in the future. Echoes of the Contactees  The Positives, although more sophisticated and complex, echo the \"contactee\" thought of the 1950s. The contactees were a group of people who spun tales of having continuing contact with benevolent \"space brothers\" who had come to Earth to prevent humans from blowing up the planet with atomic bombs and upsetting other planets in the process. Contactees were careful to suggest that the aliens believed in a Judeo-Christian god, and some even claimed that Jesus was also a religious figure for them. The contactees followed alien-directed missions to spread the word to stop atomic wars, live together in fellowship, and stamp out communism. Contactee Howard Menger summed it up: \"They are friendly people and are by far more advanced spiritually and physically than the people of this planet. At the present time they are observing us. They wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher understanding of life and its meaning.... They are only here to help you and worship the same Infinite Creator that we do.\" At first potentially reasonable, before long the contactee stories become increasingly fanciful. The space brothers gave them short rides in flying saucers-one went from Los Angeles to Kansas City. Howard Menger went to the moon. Eventually, the contactees were flying to Mars, Venus, and the outer planets. Led by \"Professor\" George Adamski, Daniel Fry, Orfeo Angelucci, Howard Menger, Truman Bethurum, Buck Nelson, and others, the contactees proved to be a terrible embarrassment to legitimate UFO researchers of the period, who had to spend great amounts of time and money combatting them and explain to a confused public that they were charlatans who did not represent legitimate UFO witnesses. Of the many influences on contactee thought, perhaps the most significant was the 1951 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still. The movie portrays humans as warlike and the peaceful alien, Klaatu, as possessing an advanced technology that can end disease for humans. Klaatu has a proto-ecological message: If Earth continues on its aggressive, warlike path, its atomic technology will endanger the community of planets; therefore,  the Earthlings must renounce war or the alien will use his robot, Gort, to blow up Earth and end the threat to the planetary confederation's peace. Although the contactees lost popularity in the 1960s, their legacy is still with us. Devoted followers of the teachings of George Adamski and other contactees still exist in the United States. The modern Swiss contactee Billy Meier has published volumes of philosophical ruminations supposedly derived from aliens who come from the Pleiades constellation. Meier has attracted a large worldwide following and supplies photos, films, and tapes of UFOs, all of dubious origin, in support of his contentions. Dr. Steven Greer has formed an organization that will take a member to a secluded place and signal aliens to come to Earth for private sightings. Greer's claims suggest a special relationship with the extraterrestrials so that they will do his bidding. The Positive Leo Sprinkle uses the word \"contactee\" to describe his and other people's experiences. He feels that meditation can cause a UFO sighting, either in the present life or in one or more past lives. He claims direct communication with aliens and can get them to answer his questions virtually on demand."
