        "text_source": "Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people from around the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs and philosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generational divides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as to priorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized many people around the world into permanent suspicion against global political elites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is our technology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply getting access to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced. Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filed online every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance are hundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there are thousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered and overwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incredible field. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history of UFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspect of the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Trying to make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone's pet project for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has been heating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are on the brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_source": "As far as the public knows at this time, we have not been able to visit places outside our solar system, though we have some good ideas about how that may be accomplished, if we were able to commit the huge resources to explore our local neighborhood, and then outside our solar system. But craft are coming here in fairly large numbers, apparently operated by humanoid beings who must have been building vehicles for deep-space travel for some time. Our nibbling at advanced technology has been recent compared to the age of the neighborhood. (Think of such recent topics as genetics, nuclear energy, microwaves, space travel, nanotechnology, the Internet, cell phones, and advanced computers.) In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves. No one in the world is prepared to give you this counsel, for how could anyone know? It takes your allies, the Allies of Humanity, to provide this perspective and this orientation. Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings. It has been a very great challenge for this individual to receive and to accept such a responsibility. He did not ask for it. Yet he is born with it. And with all the delays, the chance for success has become more of a concern to us. That is why at this time we must speak with great emphasis. And we must repeat our essential message so that we can be sure that it is being heard and understood.",

        "text_target": "The impressions that we would like to give you regarding the Greater Community are most relevant to your position in space and are most descriptive of the environments that are in close proximity to your world. Yet your range of vision is still extremely limited, and you cannot see beyond the closest planets even in your Solar System. Your attempts at radio communication are futile because no one uses this kind of technology for interplanetary communication. Travel in the universe is greatly accelerated by your standards but is still very slow, given the enormity of the physical landscape. Large empires and Collectives can only extend themselves where they have established an infrastructure nearby. Managing distant outposts is very difficult logistically and has other hazards regarding the intervention of other races, as well as problems with regional jurisdictions and disputes. For this reason, in sparsely populated areas of the galaxy, the Collectives will not be found. Even large empires may rarely send resource explorers to these regions, for they are far too distant, and even if discoveries could be made, the logistical problems in sending supplies and gaining access to these resources are formidable. To complicate the matter further, in more populated areas in the galaxy, there are regional rules of conduct. So nations are not that free to move anywhere they want to go in their explorations. Of course, we cannot expect the human family to understand this. Your current perspective is that the universe is really there to be explored and to be taken for your own advantage. But, alas, you are not the first ones to arrive there. And there are many civilizations and empires that are far older than anything that humanity has established so far on Earth. Wars and great conflicts do occur in the universe, but they are relatively rare. Rebellions and internal disputes are more common, but wars between large nations and empires in the universe are far more rare than you might think. We cannot speak for other galaxies, for we have never ventured there. But from what we know of this galaxy and of our own travels, we know these things to be quite true. Humanity is still discovering many secrets about technology, and so this is where it places its hope and its promise. However, amongst more advanced nations, power of influence in the mental environment is the far greater arena of influence. For as we have said, technology can be purchased and copied. That is not where the real advantages will usually be found. However, resources are valuable, and therefore, the destruction of natural environments is generally looked on with disfavor. To preserve these resources and environments, most resource explorers including Collectives will attempt to persuade the native race to come into alliance with them rather than try to overtake that race by force. This strategy is also understood by many advanced civilizations, who have learned through much trial and error and through many difficult periods in the history of their worlds. As societies become more technologically advanced, the need for resources is greater and the preservation of natural resources becomes a greater emphasis. In many cases, home worlds have outstripped their own planets' resources, even to the point where these worlds have become barren and unproductive. This gives evidence as to why your world is viewed with such great interest amongst those few races, relatively speaking, who are aware of you. Biologically rich, rich in resources, strategically important and accessible to many of the Collectives who live in this part of the galaxy, it is a true prize. Your proximity to areas that are fairly well inhabited holds both a disadvantage and an advantage for you. The disadvantage, of course, is that your world will be recognized and is within reach of Collectives, which are but one form of social structure in the universe. The advantage for you, however, is that your world cannot be conquered, for you live in a region that is governed by rules of conduct. If your world existed in a very remote part of the galaxy, where such rules of conduct were not established, then your world could be taken by force. It could be taken by resource explorers, by pirates, by large nation states, by anyone who could gain access to it and maintain control and authority. So the fact that you live in a more, shall we say, civilized part of the universe, does give you some degree of protection. In this region, where we also dwell, it is illegal for a new world such as yours to be invaded without the permission of the indigenous race. This means that your world cannot become a part of a larger association unless humanity demonstrates visibly that it agrees to this and that it welcomes intervention. Because the Greater Community, especially the area in which you live, is a very competitive environment and because there are many Collectives dwelling here, they tend to hold each other in check and will take legal action against one another if necessary should the basic rules of conduct be violated. Therefore, if one Collective sought to take this world by force, it would be countered by other Collectives who have an interest in this world and by their competitors elsewhere, who would hold these kinds of actions in check. We cannot expect you to be aware of the details of such a complex situation, but it is important for you to know that the universe around you is not empty and devoid of life. It is important for you to know that the universe near your shores is not primitive and unregulated. This will help you understand how the Collectives that are intervening in your world function and how they can be counteracted. This gives you certain advantages, which you must learn to recognize and to employ on your own behalf.",
        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

        "text_target": "The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions. Following the publication of the Allies of Humanity Book One in 2001, the Allies provided a second set of Briefings to complete their vital message to humanity. The Allies of Humanity Book Two, published in 2005, presents startling new information on the interactions between races in our local Universe and on the nature, purpose and most hidden activities of those races who are interfering in human affairs. The Allies initiated communication again in 2008, further describing the complex environment into which humanity is emerging. The third set of Briefings was published in 2012. Communicated in October 2016, the fourth set of Briefings builds upon the earlier briefings and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. The Allies of Humanity Book Four was published in 2019. Thanks to those readers who felt the urgency of the Allies' message and translated the Briefings into other languages, there is an expanding worldwide awareness of the reality of the Intervention. We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": "The U.S. government-funded SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, which operates on the assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio waves out into the universe, illustrates this bias. The possibility that advanced intelligences might not choose to communicate with us through such a tiny or limited technological aperture, seeking perhaps some fuller opening of our consciousness, seems not to have occurred to its inventors. As philosopher Terence McKenna has suggested, \"To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant\" (McKenna 1991). It is not altogether clear to me why we become so attached to our ways of seeing the world. Perhaps a comprehensive scientific paradigm, like any ideology, gives a sense of mastery and power. Mystery and the sense of not knowing are antithetical to the need to maintain control and seem, at times, to inspire such terror that we fear that we might blow apart, like the frog in the Tibetan story when confronted with a universe too vast to comprehend. This might explain why it is the intellectual and political elite in our culture that seems most deeply wedded to perpetuating the materi alist view of reality. The UFO abduction phenomenon, which strikes at the heart of the Western paradigm and reveals us to be utterly without control, is more readily accepted at the grassroots level than by the culturally sophisticated or most intellectually advanced among us. For it is, to a large degree, the scientific and governmental elite and the selected media that it controls that determine what we are to believe is real, for these monoliths are the principal beneficiaries of the dominant ideology. This \"politics of ontology\" (Mack 1992) is then the primary arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our homes and abduct our people would create particular problems . This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories. There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the meaning of our \"power\" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik Erikson called .. pseudospeciation\"}, is the source of prodigious suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distraction from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking the phenomenon and its implications seriously. The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of economic \"indicators\" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called \"market forces\") is not controlled, inequities in the distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen, giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It does not, cannot, \"save\" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed, the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,, profoundly \"enlightening\" in the fullest sense. The UFO abduction phenomenon presents a particular problem for some organized religions. From the beginnings of history groups of human beings, recognizing the power and potential perils of spirit forces \"out there,\" have taken upon themselves the task of guiding us through the \"ultimate matters\" (Zock 1990) of life. Religious leaders instruct us in the nature of God, and determine for us what spirit beings or other entities may exist in the cosmos. The Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, for example, in its zeal to impose a particular sort of monotheism based on the Trinity, quite ruthlessly suppressed the nature-worshipping polytheism of much of Europe."

We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity.",
        "text_source": "As far as the public knows at this time, we have not been able to visit places outside our solar system, though we have some good ideas about how that may be accomplished, if we were able to commit the huge resources to explore our local neighborhood, and then outside our solar system. But craft are coming here in fairly large numbers, apparently operated by humanoid beings who must have been building vehicles for deep-space travel for some time. Our nibbling at advanced technology has been recent compared to the age of the neighborhood. (Think of such recent topics as genetics, nuclear energy, microwaves, space travel, nanotechnology, the Internet, cell phones, and advanced computers.) In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

It is a pleasure for me to have been asked to do it again, for I have the highest regard for his absolute integrity,  his  determination  and  skill  as  a  researcher,  and  his  wide  and detailed knowledge of the whole fascinating UFO experience. Were this not so, I confess at once that I should have serious difficulty in accepting several passages in this riveting book and the astounding revelations he now shares with  the  public. Foremost  among  these,  perhaps,  are  his  reports  on widespread alien bases, including some undersea and their craft (USOs), and the possibility that the occupants have been collaborating with the Americans in the transfer of technology. In this new work the author starts from the premise that there can no longer be  any  serious  doubt  that  extraterrestrials  have  been  visiting  our  planet  for many years. He deals here with their activities, rather than with speculation about  the  craft  in  which  they  travel. We  learn  in  his  Introduction  that  the French Institute of Higher Studies for National Defence reported last year to their President and Prime Minister that 'the physical reality of UFOs under the  control  of  intelligent  beings  is  now  almost certain'  and,  as  I  have  said publicly elsewhere, I share that view. Indeed, it seems to me that the position of  even  a  few  years  ago  is  now  reversed  and  that  anyone  who  does  not believe it should be required to prove why they do not, rather than the other way round. Good cites the 'giggle factor' in his Introduction to describe the reaction of people,  who  should  know  better,  to  disclosures  about  UFOs  and  their occupants,  and  their  origin,  behaviour  and  purpose. Such  expressions  are  unfortunately commonplace and most usually appear in the writings of lazy second-rate journalists. Many share their views or, perhaps more accurately, say that they do. This reaction can only be driven by fear or ignorance and, as far as scientists are concerned, what they fear most is an attack on their own discipline; they fear their ignorance being exposed to public derision and they actually fear their inability to cope with what Good and all serious ufologists assert is the reality. As for the 'journos', they have found that it is easier to write a knocking piece about what I have called the 'little green men ha-haha ' syndrome than it would be to do some quite difficult but elementary work on analysing books such as this one. I have laboured this point because I believe it is important, particularly to new readers of the genre, to start with the notion that this is not a work of fiction; it is a carefully considered report by a distinguished and experienced researcher.

They would have found such happenings as bizarre,  fanciful  and  incredible  as  some  of  the  matters  which  have  been reported all over the world to Good by reliable and corroborated witnesses, such as Rubens Villela, a distinguished scientist who has worked for the CIA as well as the US and Brazilian navies. following questions: Why on earth should Caponi make up such an unlikely tale?

Why was a hostile Carabinieri unable to break his story or  to  discredit  his  photographs? Why  did  the  US  Embassy  in  Rome  try  to steal the photographs? If, after reading Chapters 2, 16 and 17, you still do not believe that there is something very odd going on in Puerto Rico, then you have  brought  scepticism  to  an  art  form. Why  does  almost  the  entire population believe in the existence of the so-called chupacabras? Why does the US military deny access to part of the island which is reported to contain an alien base and is sometimes guarded by armed sentries? These and many more strange stories from the island have been checked out with the author by Graham Sheppard, a recently retired British Airways captain, who relates in Chapter 2 a remarkable experience he had there himself, not far from an area where two other pilots simply disappeared some years before. He and his aircraft flying there in good weather inexplicably suffered what he describes as 'an enormous lateral displacement', which took him miles off his course and nearly into a forbidden zone. Is it likely that a man whose very career depends on his airmanship and total integrity would make up such a yarn? All these, and many other astonishing and well-documented experiences, await you in this remarkable book.

        "text_target": "We cannot answer these questions. Only you can answer them. We can provide you glimpses into life in the universe and an essential understanding of the nature and activities of the Intervention and of those who are intervening here. Yet we cannot answer every question and indeed it is not answers that you need as much as the inner conviction to see, to know and to act. Our greatest desire is that we may stimulate this within enough people that a movement will arise to offset the Intervention and to demonstrate humanity's displeasure with its uninvited guests. This would be a beneficial beginning. But it is only the beginning, for there must be an awareness of the reality of the Greater Community. And there must be a sober and profound understanding of what humanity must do in order to secure its freedom and its well-being in this larger and far more complex arena of intelligent life. It has been our desire not to cast a dark or fearful specter of life in the universe, for indeed there are many marvelous and wondrous creations, and there are many societies that have achieved very high states of awareness. Yet these still remain in the minority of the manifestations of intelligent life throughout this galaxy to the extent that we are aware of, and we have met many others who have seen things that we have never seen. In order for humanity to enter into this new panorama of life, you must have an orientation as to what exists there and what to expect and how you must function and conduct yourselves. No one in the world is prepared to give you this counsel, for how could anyone know? It takes your allies, the Allies of Humanity, to provide this perspective and this orientation. Otherwise, you would feel alone and so vulnerable that you could lose heart and capitulate to the persuasion of those who seek to gain control of you and your world. We would like now to say something about the individual who is receiving this communication. Marshall Vian Summers is not simply a man who was unwittingly chosen for a great task. He has been sent into the world for this purpose. He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission, to help prepare humanity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Many years ago, there was an attempt on our part to reach him directly. He was called to a location in a mountainous area and was prepared for his contact with us. Several members of our party made the dangerous journey into this world, but unfortunately their mission was never completed. Once they were discovered by the Intervention, they had to destroy themselves and their craft, leaving no evidence behind of our presence in the world. This marked a great failure. And the loss of four very precious individuals. There are only five of us left now. And we again are facing great danger. The preparation for our contact with this individual has been long and with many delays. First, he had to become the receiver for The Greater Community Teaching. He had to become its first student. Then he had to take a position from which he could represent this new threshold of understanding for humanity. Certain people were called to assist him, not all of whom were able to do so. Many of these delays, which were largely beyond his control, have delayed our presentation. This is why we are late in giving you our discourses and our briefings. It has been a very great challenge for this individual to receive and to accept such a responsibility. He did not ask for it. Yet he is born with it. And with all the delays, the chance for success has become more of a concern to us. That is why at this time we must speak with great emphasis. And we must repeat our essential message so that we can be sure that it is being heard and understood.",

It is a pleasure for me to have been asked to do it again, for I have the highest regard for his absolute integrity,  his  determination  and  skill  as  a  researcher,  and  his  wide  and detailed knowledge of the whole fascinating UFO experience. Were this not so, I confess at once that I should have serious difficulty in accepting several passages in this riveting book and the astounding revelations he now shares with  the  public. Foremost  among  these,  perhaps,  are  his  reports  on widespread alien bases, including some undersea and their craft (USOs), and the possibility that the occupants have been collaborating with the Americans in the transfer of technology. In this new work the author starts from the premise that there can no longer be  any  serious  doubt  that  extraterrestrials  have  been  visiting  our  planet  for many years. He deals here with their activities, rather than with speculation about  the  craft  in  which  they  travel. We  learn  in  his  Introduction  that  the French Institute of Higher Studies for National Defence reported last year to their President and Prime Minister that 'the physical reality of UFOs under the  control  of  intelligent  beings  is  now  almost certain'  and,  as  I  have  said publicly elsewhere, I share that view. Indeed, it seems to me that the position of  even  a  few  years  ago  is  now  reversed  and  that  anyone  who  does  not believe it should be required to prove why they do not, rather than the other way round.

In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions. Following the publication of the Allies of Humanity Book One in 2001, the Allies provided a second set of Briefings to complete their vital message to humanity. The Allies of Humanity Book Two, published in 2005, presents startling new information on the interactions between races in our local Universe and on the nature, purpose and most hidden activities of those races who are interfering in human affairs. The Allies initiated communication again in 2008, further describing the complex environment into which humanity is emerging. The third set of Briefings was published in 2012. Communicated in October 2016, the fourth set of Briefings builds upon the earlier briefings and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. The Allies of Humanity Book Four was published in 2019. Thanks to those readers who felt the urgency of the Allies' message and translated the Briefings into other languages, there is an expanding worldwide awareness of the reality of the Intervention. We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": " The publication of the hardcover edition of this book in April 1994 met with a strong response, both supportive and critical. I would like to take the opportunity of the paperback publication to express my appreciation to those who were open to what I have been learning. But I also feel that it is important to address some of the criticisms I have received, especially the charge that the work is an example of a kind of cult of irrationality, an exercise in anti-science and unreason. Upon reviewing the text of the book with the help of colleagues, it is apparent that my growing conviction about the authenticity of these reports, together with a sense of their great potential significance, resulted in a tendency to write as if the fact or reality of the experiences was established before the case had been made. In so doing, I may have denied some readers, especially those who would be naturally skeptical, the opportunity to make up their own minds. In this revised edition, I have altered the language in specific places to make clear that I am reporting the experiences of the abductees as told to me and not presuming that everything they say is literally true. Whether or not each of their communications is recorded with qualifying words like \"reported that\" or \"according to,\" the objective distance between me and the experiences implicit in such phrases should be understood throughout the text. Basic clinical scientific questions that have been raised, such as the status of physical evidence, the role of subject expectation or investigator influence, the reliability of memory, the accuracy of hypnosis, and the possibility of alternative explanations have been addressed in Appendix A. Finally, in order to improve the book's readability, the historical and crosscultural sections have been moved to the back (Appendix B), and the opening sections that contain my introduction and first reactions to learning about the abduction phenomenon have been streamlined. \u2022 The most archetypal expression of the cry of anti-science came from science writer James Gleick in a review in the New Republic magazine (Gleick 1994 ). Gleick called the \"alien-abduction mythology\" a \"leading case of the anti-rational, anti-science cults that are flourishing with dismaying vigor in the United States.\" He lumps the alien abduction phenomenon together with \"paranormals who bend spoons, parapsychologists who sense spiritual auras, crystal healers, believers in reincarnation\" and \"psychic crime-solvers\" as well as \"tarot readers and crystal ball gazers.\" In a similar vein psychoanalyst Sanford Gifford, in a review of my book for a psychoanalytic journal (Gifford, in press), called it a \"subversive assault on psychoanalysis as a science\" (he assumes that the phenomenon must be some sort of product of the unconscious mind), and wrote of the abduction experiencers as individuals \"holding irrational beliefs that are not shared by the 'compact majority.' \" In that sense, he continued, \"they are 'crazy' in the same way as believers in Creationism, faith healing, thought transference, or the end of the world on a specific date.\" Music critic (!) Milo Miles, reviewing Abduction in The Boston Globe worried that \"the secular world and the spirit world must be kept as separate as church and state.\" He concludes that \"Mack should beware that if rationality and objective truth are thrown out the door, no one can predict what will rush in through the opening (Miles 1994).\" I believe these critiques reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of rationality and reason, and even of science itself. For what the worldview implicit in these statements requires is the a priori exclusion of vast amounts of data simply because that information is in conflict with that point of view. This, I believe, is a far more irrational, and even dangerous, approach to knowledge than to allow information from every possible legitimate source to come into our minds before applying rationality and reason in assessing this information once we have \"let it in.\" To exclude data because it does not fit a particular view of reality can only, in the end, arrest the progress of science and keep us ignorant. The worldview that Gleick, Gifford, and Miles espouse is what is usually called the \"materialist paradigm.\" According to this view, which until recently has dominated mainstream science (although now it is increasingly being questioned, even in contemporary physics), there is only one hard rea_lity, namely that which is observable through the sensory/empirical mode. This dualistic approach would separate cleanly the observer from the observed, subject from object. In so doing, all of the information about other or \"unseen\" realities that has become available to us through anthropology, comparative religion, parapsychology, consciousness research, and various uses of nonordinary states inside and outside the laboratory-to name but a few sources of data-would, of necessity, have to be excluded. This worldview and its accompanying restrictive epistemology would, in short, eliminate human consciousness and experience as legitimate ways of knowing about reality. Of the many responses which were more open to my material, Kathryn Robinson's reaction to Gleick's review (Robinson 1994) was one of the most telling. Addressing the restrictiveness of the worldview that Gleick's assault reflected she wrote, \"scientific discovery is not a matter of jamming data into existing categories\ufffd it's about supporting new ones. It's about admitting how much we don't know-in marked contrast to the hubris of a rationalist such as Gleick, who argues that any phenomenon that's not available to his senses must therefore be a sham. Gleick's arrogance,\" she notes, \"would perhaps approach respectability if there were no mysteries left to science.\" Psychologist William James made the same point a hundred years ago. \"The ideal of every science,\" James wrote, \"is that of a closed and completed system of truth .... Phenomena unclassifiable within a system are therefore paradoxical absurdities and must be held untrue (James 1896).\" As I discuss throughout this book, our knowledge of the abduction phenomenon depends, fundamentally,\u00b7 upon human experience-i.e., the reports of the abductees themselves and the recording, sifting, and evaluating of these reports by the investigator. That is, of necessity, a participatory process in which the person exploring the experiences-in this case myself-must enter fully and empathically into the experiencer's world in order to create the context of trust that will bring forth the relevant information. My reasons for taking these experiences seriously are discussed throughout the book, including Appendix A. They have to do essentially with the consistency of reports conveyed with extreme intensity of feeling by sincere individuals of sound mind in the United States and now, increasingly, from around the world, who may themselves doubt profoundly-or would wish to forget-the reality of what they have undergone. No plausible alternative explanation for the reports of abduction experiences, which are sometimes corroborated by physical evidence, has been discovered. This book provides the most detailed accounts we have to date from people who report abduction experiences. These reports, I xii PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION believe, raise profound questions about how we experience the world around us and the very nature of that world. The information that I obtained during the several years of this investigation has been communicated in case after case with such power and consistency that a body of data formed which seemed to point clearly to the experiential truth of the abduction phenomenon, whatever its ultimate source might prove to be. The fact that what the experiencers are describing simply cannot be possible according to our traditional scientific view would, it seems to me, more sensibly, yes rationally, call for a change in that perspective, an expansion of our notions of reality, rather than the \"jamming\" of \"data into existing categories\" that some critics would have us do. It was in the hope of serving a misunderstood population by making sense of their experiences, and, above all, of provoking my readers to reconsider their views of the universe in which we live, that I undertook to write this book."

        "text_source": "Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

        "text_target": "That is why uncharted territories remain uncharted, for space exploration is only peripheral and is never carried very far. Ships require fuel. Fuel cannot be resupplied. Explorers enter regions where there are unknown forces. Explorers encounter environmental and logistical problems. Visiting terrestrial planets always has a biological hazard if they contain a large biological presence. Many groups have become sickened and have perished. Travel in the universe is a very difficult and formidable task. Its distances are incredibly vast, and once you leave a known territory, you are on your own. If you do not have proper charting and maps, becoming lost is very easy, and finding your way back very difficult. Nations use transmitters to communicate with distant travelers, but beyond a certain distance, it is impossible to locate a ship. This represents the limits of technology, limits that the human family has not reached. The human family dreams of unlimited power and abilities in the universe, thinking they can go wherever they want, do whatever they want and meet whomever they want. But, alas, the reality is so very different. There is no race that is shepherding humanity as if you were the children and they were the parents. Yet you have potential allies whom you may engage with in the future, if ever you are to establish and maintain the three requirements for freedom that we have mentioned. At this point, humanity is not ready for Contact, and that is one of the reasons why the Intervention is inappropriate and unethical. Humanity is unable to engage wisely with the Greater Community. It lacks the maturity, the unity, the strength and the discernment to be able to do this effectively. To engage with humanity under these circumstances is to take advantage of its weakness and its lack of wisdom and expertise. You cannot help a young race by interfering and trying to control its destiny, and no nation that is wise would try to attempt this. Those that do are here for their own purposes and are seeking the fulfillment of their own goals. Humanity has built up layers of expectation, fantasy and belief that make it impossible for you to contemplate the reality of life beyond your borders or to see that the Greater Community is an expression of nature on a vast and incomprehensible scale. Here the laws of nature still continue and still limit the movements and the behavior of races. Technology cannot overcome this completely. Many people may be disappointed by the universe that we are presenting, but this is the real universe that you will have to contend with, and you ignore the gifts of this vision at your own peril. The Greater Community is not a human universe governed by human values, human aspirations, human wishes or human history. Even the races close to you, relatively speaking, in this region of space are entirely different in appearance, in thought, in behavior, in the structure of their societies and civilization and in their emphasis. They would be incomprehensible to you, as you are incomprehensible to them. Humanity is viewed by those few races who pay attention to this world as being chaotic, unruly and potentially dangerous. You are certainly not highly regarded for the way the Earth is being exploited and its wealth is being plundered. You do not realize how valuable a tree is in the Greater Community, how valuable seeds are, the great need for fluids from plants and animals and the problem in securing biological resources and rare metals. That is why humanity is viewed as reckless and without wisdom. Even though your competitors have no regard for you, your allies recognize the power of Knowledge that exists within the human family and its potential to guide you in the right direction and to prevent you from being easily seduced or to succumbing to your own weakness or to the persuasions of other races who would take advantage of your situation and your circumstances. Your focus on war is entirely inappropriate in the Greater Community that you will encounter, where violence is extremely rare and is greatly suppressed. You will not be able to go out into the universe to exploit all the resources you have destroyed here on Earth without engaging yourself permanently in a complex network of trade and commerce, over which you will have little or no authority. These are some of the corrections that must be made if humanity is to approach the Greater Community objectively, utilizing your awareness of nature, your awareness of your own history, the history of intervention in your world and what native peoples must do to establish their sovereignty and their self-determination amidst the presence of foreign and unanticipated powers. Do not think that your subjugation represents your destiny. Do not believe that another race will come and govern you with wisdom and compassion. Do not think that gaining ever higher levels of technology will assure you any greater advantage in the Greater Community. Beyond the requirements of establishing your unity, your self-sufficiency and your discretion, technology becomes ever more hazardous. It begins to work against everything you have created for yourself. Your greatest defense against exploitive powers in the universe is your unity, your self-sufficiency and your discretion. Certain levels of technology will have to be established to meet the needs of humanity in the future and to discern the presence of foreign visitors. But because you live in a well-inhabited region of space, you have certain advantages that prevent others from attempting to use force against you. As races evolve, they begin to realize that force is destructive and that persuasion is far more beneficial, though perhaps more time consuming. This represents their strength and your weakness. But because Knowledge is alive within you, this weakness can be overcome. The great opportunity for humanity is to finally achieve a state of unity, stability and security-security within and security without. Without this security, life is hazardous and continuously problematic and discordant. You are entering a period now within your own world where stability and inner security will become ever more important, supplanting your emphasis on growth and expansion, requiring different kinds of behavior and a far greater degree of cooperation and assistance within the human family. Adversity here is your ally if you can utilize it correctly. It is a decision not only for your leaders, but for your citizens as well. It is time for humanity to become mature, to enter into a more mature phase of its long history, to unite to establish a permanent and stable residence in this world and to establish boundaries and discernment regarding your interaction with other races. If your emphasis on growth and expansion continues, you will move right into the Greater Community in the most vulnerable position you can imagine. We warn you against that. Our presence here is a reminder that there are races in the universe who are free, who have earned their freedom and who have had to take great actions to restore their freedom whenever it has been threatened. The universe is a hazardous environment, but a maturing environment as well. You cannot be like adolescents functioning within this sophisticated environment. These words represent part of our gift to humanity, a gift of wisdom-given without interference, given without manipulation, given without the effort to control or overtake human thought or behavior. It is a gift of incomparable value if you can receive it and apply it in your own world, in your own circumstances. The risks are immense. The requirements are great. You do not have a great deal of time to prepare for the Greater Community. Life is moving quickly. The Earth is being overwhelmed. You are destroying your life-giving resources at a very fast rate. Therefore, you do not have much time, and we pray and trust that our guidance and counsel can be received as a gift of respect from our nations to yours, and that our intentions for you are clear and will not fall under suspicion. We have no design to engage with your world, for you are far from being ready for any real contact that would be beneficial to us. We do not seek what your world possesses, for we have attained self-sufficiency, which is perhaps the greatest achievement that any race can establish and maintain in the universe. Perhaps in the future we may share more of how we have established our societies, but for right now there are greater matters at hand. You have greater issues to attend to. You must promote human unity. You must encourage the cessation of war for the reasons we have given for the security of the world and its position within a Greater Community of intelligent life. Human unity, self-sufficiency and discretion are necessary if humanity is to gain freedom from constant intrusion and intervention from the Greater Community. Here humanity must establish its own rules of engagement regarding any visitation to this world and establish a boundary to space, over which humanity can preside. Humanity has been given by right and heritage dominance within this solar system as your natural sphere of influence, but beyond this you cannot extend yourself, nor should you, unless guided by Knowledge and wisdom. These are recommendations and corrections. Heed them well, for they will serve you now. You cannot afford to indulge in fantasies and wishful thinking regarding the Greater Community in which you live. You must become strong and determined, and you must gain access to the deeper Knowledge that is within you, that is free from error and that cannot be persuaded by anything beyond the will and the power of the Creator of all life. It is this Knowledge that will resonate with our words and that will demonstrate to you our true intent and your great promise for the future. There are many voices speaking to the world. Knowledge will tell you what to listen to, but your connection to Knowledge must be true, it must be deep and it must be strong. You were born to live in these times and to face these challenges, so the Creator of all life has endowed you with Knowledge that can lead you to do this correctly and effectively, both for the present and for the future. Freedom is difficult to achieve and to maintain, but its reward is beyond estimation. Never forget this. Your freedom, our freedom and the possibility for freedom elsewhere represent the true expansion and evolution of life and the greatest promise and achievement for all who are living in this vast universe.",
        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_source": "Using a genetic fingerprinting method on the infants, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues revealed in the British journal Human Reproduction, that genes from the donor cytoplasm are definitely present in some of the babies, along with those of the moms and dads. But the researchers are emphatic that the additional genes of the third-party donors are inconsequential and won't have any effect on the children's characteristics. Not so fast, say ethicists writing in the journal Science. The donated cytoplasm of these eggs contains more than just proteins to help the egg grow. It also holds mitochondria, the tiny structures that manufacture energy for the cells out of oxygen and nutrients. And mitochondria contain their own genetic material. The ethicists suggest that these experiments would never have been approved by the federal committee that oversees genetic work. But, because the work was privately funded, the researchers weren't required to get anyone's permission except the parents-all three of them. In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_source": "Some visitors may not want us to know what they are doing here, and in any event, can probably go about their business with none of us any the wiser (particularly if they are able to function in another dimension!). It is therefore likely that those who have been contacted are fed a certain amount of false information. Disinformation could well be an inevitable consequence of contact. Others may be so advanced, technologically, culturally, and spiritually , that contact with our relatively retarded species might be seen as disadvantageous to both parties. In this regard, the comments made by Daniel Fry's alleged extraterrestrial friend in 1949 are worth recounting. We will never attempt to thrust either our knowledge or our culture upon your people, he said, and we will never offer it unless there is substantial evidence that they desire it, and that it would be advantageous to them. There is certainly no such evidence at the present time. It is also true that the purpose of this visit is not entirely philanthropic, since there are some materials upon your planet which we could use to the advantage of both our peoples; materials which you have in abundance but which are rather scarce elsewhere in this solar system. While the use of some of these materials would be of assistance to us, our services to your people will not be made contingent upon such use. Any knowledge or aid which we can give will be freely offered. . . . If we took steps to force the acceptance of our reality upon their consciousness, Fry was told, about 30 percent of the people would consider us as gods, and could attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their welfare. This is a responsibility we could not be permitted to assume, even if we were able to discharge it, which of course, we are not. Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe."

Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions. Following the publication of the Allies of Humanity Book One in 2001, the Allies provided a second set of Briefings to complete their vital message to humanity. The Allies of Humanity Book Two, published in 2005, presents startling new information on the interactions between races in our local Universe and on the nature, purpose and most hidden activities of those races who are interfering in human affairs. The Allies initiated communication again in 2008, further describing the complex environment into which humanity is emerging. The third set of Briefings was published in 2012. Communicated in October 2016, the fourth set of Briefings builds upon the earlier briefings and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. The Allies of Humanity Book Four was published in 2019. Thanks to those readers who felt the urgency of the Allies' message and translated the Briefings into other languages, there is an expanding worldwide awareness of the reality of the Intervention. We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": "THE SURVIVORS  During this same lengthy communication in April 1954, Alan described what had happened to the survivors of the devastating conflict that had destroyed an entire civilization tens of thousands of years ago. On a high plateau in what is now Tibet, six of the surviving aerial craft were landed by their crews, to determine the fate of the survivors:  It was suggested that an attempt be made to reach another planet. The aerial craft then in use were capable of traveling in space, and had frequently been used to reach elevations of hundreds of miles, but no attempt had yet been made to leap the vast gulf between the planets, and the crew members were far from certain that such an attempt could succeed. The planet which you now know as Mars was then in conjunction with the Earth, and preliminary estimates seemed to indicate that the crossing could be made. At that time, the surface conditions of temperature, atmosphere, water, etc. were somewhat better suited for human survival than the conditions your astronomers report to exist today. A vote was taken, and the members of the crews of four of the craft elected to take the huge gamble in the hope of preserving, thereby, at least a portion of the culture of the race. The remaining crews decided to remain on Earth. They believed that, because of the elevation of the plateau on which they were gathered, and the relatively low level of radiation at that point, they could continue to live in this area without suffering complete physical or mental degeneration in themselves or their descendants. I can see the question forming in your mind, so I will explain that this race had achieved perfect equality of the sexes, and both were equally represented in this council, and in the crews of the ships. Of the four craft which essayed the great leap, three arrived safely at their destination. There is no record in our history as to the fate of the fourth. For many generations the grim struggle for survival demanded the entire time and energy of the people ... As the battle for survival against the harsh environment was gradually won, the development of the material science resumed its normal pattern, and technology spurted ahead. With the lessons of the past constantly before the people, however, the material values were carefully maintained in their proper relationship to the social and spiritual values. 'The greatest need of your race, your civilization and your society today,' concluded Alan, 'is simple, basic understanding between man and his fellow man, between nation and nation, and between all men and that greater power and intelligence that pervades and controls all nature. Understanding is the key to survival for your race . . . l  DISCUSSION  Was Dan Fry really taken for a ride - or was he taking us for a ride? I have dwelled at length on his story for two reasons: first, because I believe it to be fundamental to the understanding of certain extraterrestrial encounters; secondly, because I believe the story to be essentially true. That is not to say that I accept it unreservedly. There are a number of Fry's claims that require critical commentary."

Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions. Following the publication of the Allies of Humanity Book One in 2001, the Allies provided a second set of Briefings to complete their vital message to humanity. The Allies of Humanity Book Two, published in 2005, presents startling new information on the interactions between races in our local Universe and on the nature, purpose and most hidden activities of those races who are interfering in human affairs. The Allies initiated communication again in 2008, further describing the complex environment into which humanity is emerging. The third set of Briefings was published in 2012. Communicated in October 2016, the fourth set of Briefings builds upon the earlier briefings and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. The Allies of Humanity Book Four was published in 2019. Thanks to those readers who felt the urgency of the Allies' message and translated the Briefings into other languages, there is an expanding worldwide awareness of the reality of the Intervention. We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": "IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN IDENTITY Each abductee experiences in some sense an expansion of his or her sense of self, of identity in the world. Paul wondered how we had come to mistake the \"shell\" of our being for the \"whole\" of it; and Eva, in her recall of the Soul Bird story of her childhood, recognized there were compartments of self which she was opening up and merging in order to move from fragmentation toward wholeness. The change that abductees experience is fundamentally that they may no longer feel themselves to be separate from other beings. They shed their identification with a narrow social role and gain a sense of oneness with all creation, a kind of universal connectedness. This opening to a wider identity appears to be a direct result of the abduction experiences, if not a central aspect of the whole process. The change appears to be the result of two related elements. The abduction experiences themselves shatter the illusion of our control, and demonstrate forcefully \ufffdhat we are helpless in the face of forces and beings whose purpose we do not understand. Each abductee discovers that he or she is but one intelligent being in a universe populated with various other entities that are not \"supposed to\" exist. Human beings are not lords of the earth, they realize, but children of the cosmos who must find their way to live in harmony with all manner of creatures on the earth and elsewhere. This is a terrifying lesson in humility that opens the psyche to a wider perception of the universe, including the beings and entities that inhabit it. At the same time, as I noted, some abductees become open to the presence of a divine source, which fills their being and gives a sense of connection with a universal consciousness from which they have come and to which they will return. \"Past life\" experiences, which seem to extend the sense of self over time in both embodied and unembodied form, create a further expansion of the feeling of what it is to be a human being. Finally, the peculiar sense that many abductees gain during the relaxation sessions that they have a dual huf!lan/alien identity reinforces all of the above processes . For the alien self is felt to be a kind of missing part, a soul link to the universal source of consciousness, the anima mundi from which they feel they have been cut off.PoLITICAL, EcoNOMIC, AND RELIGious IMPLICATIONS The Western scientific/materialist worldview has been hugely successful in its explorations of the physical world, revealing many of its secrets and using this knowledge to serve human purposes. We have overcome the harshness of winter, reduced suffering through advances in medicine, and learned to communicate electronically with those who are far away. At the same time we have applied our knowledge to creating weapons of destruction that can now easily destroy life as we know it. Our use of modern technology to tear resources from the earth is bringing the biosphere to the brink of collapse. We are a species out of harmony with nature, gone berserk in the indulgence of its desires at the expense of other living beings and the earth that has given us life. The task of reversing this trend is momentous. Even as we recognize the peril we have created, the vested interests that stand in the way of discovering a balance in our relationship with nature are formidable. Huge \u00b7corporate, scientific, educational, and military institutions consume many billions of dollars of material goods and maintain, as if mindlessly, a paralyzing stasis that is difficult to reverse. For international business the world seems at times to be nothing more than a giant market to be divided up among the cleverest entrepreneurs."

        "text_target": "The impressions that we would like to give you regarding the Greater Community are most relevant to your position in space and are most descriptive of the environments that are in close proximity to your world. Yet your range of vision is still extremely limited, and you cannot see beyond the closest planets even in your Solar System. Your attempts at radio communication are futile because no one uses this kind of technology for interplanetary communication. Travel in the universe is greatly accelerated by your standards but is still very slow, given the enormity of the physical landscape. Large empires and Collectives can only extend themselves where they have established an infrastructure nearby. Managing distant outposts is very difficult logistically and has other hazards regarding the intervention of other races, as well as problems with regional jurisdictions and disputes. For this reason, in sparsely populated areas of the galaxy, the Collectives will not be found. Even large empires may rarely send resource explorers to these regions, for they are far too distant, and even if discoveries could be made, the logistical problems in sending supplies and gaining access to these resources are formidable. To complicate the matter further, in more populated areas in the galaxy, there are regional rules of conduct. So nations are not that free to move anywhere they want to go in their explorations. Of course, we cannot expect the human family to understand this. Your current perspective is that the universe is really there to be explored and to be taken for your own advantage. But, alas, you are not the first ones to arrive there. And there are many civilizations and empires that are far older than anything that humanity has established so far on Earth. Wars and great conflicts do occur in the universe, but they are relatively rare. Rebellions and internal disputes are more common, but wars between large nations and empires in the universe are far more rare than you might think. We cannot speak for other galaxies, for we have never ventured there. But from what we know of this galaxy and of our own travels, we know these things to be quite true. Humanity is still discovering many secrets about technology, and so this is where it places its hope and its promise. However, amongst more advanced nations, power of influence in the mental environment is the far greater arena of influence. For as we have said, technology can be purchased and copied. That is not where the real advantages will usually be found. However, resources are valuable, and therefore, the destruction of natural environments is generally looked on with disfavor. To preserve these resources and environments, most resource explorers including Collectives will attempt to persuade the native race to come into alliance with them rather than try to overtake that race by force. This strategy is also understood by many advanced civilizations, who have learned through much trial and error and through many difficult periods in the history of their worlds. As societies become more technologically advanced, the need for resources is greater and the preservation of natural resources becomes a greater emphasis. In many cases, home worlds have outstripped their own planets' resources, even to the point where these worlds have become barren and unproductive. This gives evidence as to why your world is viewed with such great interest amongst those few races, relatively speaking, who are aware of you. Biologically rich, rich in resources, strategically important and accessible to many of the Collectives who live in this part of the galaxy, it is a true prize. Your proximity to areas that are fairly well inhabited holds both a disadvantage and an advantage for you. The disadvantage, of course, is that your world will be recognized and is within reach of Collectives, which are but one form of social structure in the universe. The advantage for you, however, is that your world cannot be conquered, for you live in a region that is governed by rules of conduct. If your world existed in a very remote part of the galaxy, where such rules of conduct were not established, then your world could be taken by force. It could be taken by resource explorers, by pirates, by large nation states, by anyone who could gain access to it and maintain control and authority. So the fact that you live in a more, shall we say, civilized part of the universe, does give you some degree of protection. In this region, where we also dwell, it is illegal for a new world such as yours to be invaded without the permission of the indigenous race. This means that your world cannot become a part of a larger association unless humanity demonstrates visibly that it agrees to this and that it welcomes intervention. Because the Greater Community, especially the area in which you live, is a very competitive environment and because there are many Collectives dwelling here, they tend to hold each other in check and will take legal action against one another if necessary should the basic rules of conduct be violated. Therefore, if one Collective sought to take this world by force, it would be countered by other Collectives who have an interest in this world and by their competitors elsewhere, who would hold these kinds of actions in check. We cannot expect you to be aware of the details of such a complex situation, but it is important for you to know that the universe around you is not empty and devoid of life. It is important for you to know that the universe near your shores is not primitive and unregulated. This will help you understand how the Collectives that are intervening in your world function and how they can be counteracted. This gives you certain advantages, which you must learn to recognize and to employ on your own behalf.",
        "text_source": "Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people from around the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs and philosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generational divides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as to priorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized many people around the world into permanent suspicion against global political elites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is our technology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply getting access to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced. Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filed online every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance are hundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there are thousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered and overwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incredible field. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history of UFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspect of the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Trying to make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone's pet project for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has been heating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are on the brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "Throughout their Briefings, the Allies talk about the importance of human freedom and self-determination in an environment of tremendously powerful persuasion and inducements, particularly cast upon a young race emerging into this Greater Community of life, and how many other emerging races in the universe have fallen prey to Intervention such as we are facing now. We are unprepared for Contact with this Greater Community. For we can only imagine, through our media, film and science, what life might be like beyond our borders. But the picture that the Allies Briefings present is very different than what most people think of today. The Allies Briefings are grounded in the realities of life in our local universe and therefore present a much more accurate representation of what actually exists beyond us. From this, we can begin to see that the universe is an expression of the same reality of nature that we experience in our world. Yet it is nature occurring on a scale and a level of complexity beyond what we can imagine. As a result, the Allies Briefings emphasize that we can understand the reality of Intervention from our own experience of intervention here on Earth. Our history has shown us the evidence of intervention of one culture upon another, one nation upon another, repeatedly over time. This means that our own history and native wisdom can enable us to see and understand a great deal about who is here and why they have come. Yet there is much we cannot see and know about what life is like in our local universe, but which we would need to know if we are to understand who is visiting our world. To understand who is here and why they're here and what this means for us, we have to understand something about what life is like in the universe around us. We have to understand what would bring an Intervention here, what creates it, what strengthens it, what gives it power, what limits its power. The first three sets of Allies Briefings provide us this perspective very directly. The fourth set of Briefings builds upon this and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. With this, they reveal the great Spiritual Coordination that exists throughout the universe through which the Creator of all life supports spiritual development, awareness, unity and freedom in the universe. The Allies devote one of their Briefings to the Networks of the Wise, which represents individuals in many different worlds who are being guided by this Greater Coordination to support their world's freedom and well-being, creating a vast network through which wisdom can be sent from one world to another. The Allies reveal that they are part of this Network of the Wise. Throughout their Briefings, the Allies emphasize that we are now the native peoples of the Earth, facing Intervention from powers from beyond. To recognize this requires courage, clarity, objectivity and awareness. The time for this awareness and recognition has come. Our need is pressing and it is now. There are things we must know about life in the universe around us and about the nature and purpose of those intervening in our world today, which the Allies of Humanity are revealing to us. The Allies of Humanity emphasize that we must resist the Intervention through education, through awareness building, and through a growing human alliance and the empowerment of those who are seeing the Intervention's activities and who are being affected by them. To do this, the Allies emphasize that we must rely upon the power of our innate spiritual Intelligence within, which is called Knowledge. This greater Intelligence is humanity's inherent ability to see and to know the truth beyond fear and preference, to see and know the Intervention for what it really is. To enable us to gain access to this Knowledge, a preparation has been given to us from the Creator of all life called the Steps to Knowledge. This is the pathway of discovering Knowledge and building your connection to it in the context of the Greater Community.",
        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

        "text_target": "That is why uncharted territories remain uncharted, for space exploration is only peripheral and is never carried very far. Ships require fuel. Fuel cannot be resupplied. Explorers enter regions where there are unknown forces. Explorers encounter environmental and logistical problems. Visiting terrestrial planets always has a biological hazard if they contain a large biological presence. Many groups have become sickened and have perished. Travel in the universe is a very difficult and formidable task. Its distances are incredibly vast, and once you leave a known territory, you are on your own. If you do not have proper charting and maps, becoming lost is very easy, and finding your way back very difficult. Nations use transmitters to communicate with distant travelers, but beyond a certain distance, it is impossible to locate a ship. This represents the limits of technology, limits that the human family has not reached. The human family dreams of unlimited power and abilities in the universe, thinking they can go wherever they want, do whatever they want and meet whomever they want. But, alas, the reality is so very different. There is no race that is shepherding humanity as if you were the children and they were the parents. Yet you have potential allies whom you may engage with in the future, if ever you are to establish and maintain the three requirements for freedom that we have mentioned. At this point, humanity is not ready for Contact, and that is one of the reasons why the Intervention is inappropriate and unethical. Humanity is unable to engage wisely with the Greater Community. It lacks the maturity, the unity, the strength and the discernment to be able to do this effectively. To engage with humanity under these circumstances is to take advantage of its weakness and its lack of wisdom and expertise. You cannot help a young race by interfering and trying to control its destiny, and no nation that is wise would try to attempt this. Those that do are here for their own purposes and are seeking the fulfillment of their own goals. Humanity has built up layers of expectation, fantasy and belief that make it impossible for you to contemplate the reality of life beyond your borders or to see that the Greater Community is an expression of nature on a vast and incomprehensible scale. Here the laws of nature still continue and still limit the movements and the behavior of races. Technology cannot overcome this completely. Many people may be disappointed by the universe that we are presenting, but this is the real universe that you will have to contend with, and you ignore the gifts of this vision at your own peril. The Greater Community is not a human universe governed by human values, human aspirations, human wishes or human history. Even the races close to you, relatively speaking, in this region of space are entirely different in appearance, in thought, in behavior, in the structure of their societies and civilization and in their emphasis. They would be incomprehensible to you, as you are incomprehensible to them. Humanity is viewed by those few races who pay attention to this world as being chaotic, unruly and potentially dangerous. You are certainly not highly regarded for the way the Earth is being exploited and its wealth is being plundered. You do not realize how valuable a tree is in the Greater Community, how valuable seeds are, the great need for fluids from plants and animals and the problem in securing biological resources and rare metals. That is why humanity is viewed as reckless and without wisdom. Even though your competitors have no regard for you, your allies recognize the power of Knowledge that exists within the human family and its potential to guide you in the right direction and to prevent you from being easily seduced or to succumbing to your own weakness or to the persuasions of other races who would take advantage of your situation and your circumstances. Your focus on war is entirely inappropriate in the Greater Community that you will encounter, where violence is extremely rare and is greatly suppressed. You will not be able to go out into the universe to exploit all the resources you have destroyed here on Earth without engaging yourself permanently in a complex network of trade and commerce, over which you will have little or no authority. These are some of the corrections that must be made if humanity is to approach the Greater Community objectively, utilizing your awareness of nature, your awareness of your own history, the history of intervention in your world and what native peoples must do to establish their sovereignty and their self-determination amidst the presence of foreign and unanticipated powers. Do not think that your subjugation represents your destiny. Do not believe that another race will come and govern you with wisdom and compassion. Do not think that gaining ever higher levels of technology will assure you any greater advantage in the Greater Community. Beyond the requirements of establishing your unity, your self-sufficiency and your discretion, technology becomes ever more hazardous. It begins to work against everything you have created for yourself. Your greatest defense against exploitive powers in the universe is your unity, your self-sufficiency and your discretion. Certain levels of technology will have to be established to meet the needs of humanity in the future and to discern the presence of foreign visitors. But because you live in a well-inhabited region of space, you have certain advantages that prevent others from attempting to use force against you. As races evolve, they begin to realize that force is destructive and that persuasion is far more beneficial, though perhaps more time consuming. This represents their strength and your weakness. But because Knowledge is alive within you, this weakness can be overcome. The great opportunity for humanity is to finally achieve a state of unity, stability and security-security within and security without. Without this security, life is hazardous and continuously problematic and discordant. You are entering a period now within your own world where stability and inner security will become ever more important, supplanting your emphasis on growth and expansion, requiring different kinds of behavior and a far greater degree of cooperation and assistance within the human family. Adversity here is your ally if you can utilize it correctly. It is a decision not only for your leaders, but for your citizens as well. It is time for humanity to become mature, to enter into a more mature phase of its long history, to unite to establish a permanent and stable residence in this world and to establish boundaries and discernment regarding your interaction with other races. If your emphasis on growth and expansion continues, you will move right into the Greater Community in the most vulnerable position you can imagine. We warn you against that. Our presence here is a reminder that there are races in the universe who are free, who have earned their freedom and who have had to take great actions to restore their freedom whenever it has been threatened. The universe is a hazardous environment, but a maturing environment as well. You cannot be like adolescents functioning within this sophisticated environment. These words represent part of our gift to humanity, a gift of wisdom-given without interference, given without manipulation, given without the effort to control or overtake human thought or behavior. It is a gift of incomparable value if you can receive it and apply it in your own world, in your own circumstances. The risks are immense. The requirements are great. You do not have a great deal of time to prepare for the Greater Community. Life is moving quickly. The Earth is being overwhelmed. You are destroying your life-giving resources at a very fast rate. Therefore, you do not have much time, and we pray and trust that our guidance and counsel can be received as a gift of respect from our nations to yours, and that our intentions for you are clear and will not fall under suspicion. We have no design to engage with your world, for you are far from being ready for any real contact that would be beneficial to us. We do not seek what your world possesses, for we have attained self-sufficiency, which is perhaps the greatest achievement that any race can establish and maintain in the universe. Perhaps in the future we may share more of how we have established our societies, but for right now there are greater matters at hand. You have greater issues to attend to. You must promote human unity. You must encourage the cessation of war for the reasons we have given for the security of the world and its position within a Greater Community of intelligent life. Human unity, self-sufficiency and discretion are necessary if humanity is to gain freedom from constant intrusion and intervention from the Greater Community. Here humanity must establish its own rules of engagement regarding any visitation to this world and establish a boundary to space, over which humanity can preside. Humanity has been given by right and heritage dominance within this solar system as your natural sphere of influence, but beyond this you cannot extend yourself, nor should you, unless guided by Knowledge and wisdom. These are recommendations and corrections. Heed them well, for they will serve you now. You cannot afford to indulge in fantasies and wishful thinking regarding the Greater Community in which you live. You must become strong and determined, and you must gain access to the deeper Knowledge that is within you, that is free from error and that cannot be persuaded by anything beyond the will and the power of the Creator of all life. It is this Knowledge that will resonate with our words and that will demonstrate to you our true intent and your great promise for the future. There are many voices speaking to the world. Knowledge will tell you what to listen to, but your connection to Knowledge must be true, it must be deep and it must be strong. You were born to live in these times and to face these challenges, so the Creator of all life has endowed you with Knowledge that can lead you to do this correctly and effectively, both for the present and for the future. Freedom is difficult to achieve and to maintain, but its reward is beyond estimation. Never forget this. Your freedom, our freedom and the possibility for freedom elsewhere represent the true expansion and evolution of life and the greatest promise and achievement for all who are living in this vast universe.",
        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

Therefore, the visitors will focus on those fundamental ideas that give them this authority and influence. A Second Coming, then, is being prepared by your visitors. The evidence of this, we understand, is already in the world. People do not realize the presence of the visitors or the nature of reality in the Greater Community, and so they will naturally accept their prior beliefs without question, feeling that the time has come for the great return of their Savior and their Teacher. But he who will come will not come from the Heavenly Host, he will not represent Knowledge or the Unseen Ones, and he will not represent the Creator or the Creator's will. We have seen this plan in formulation in the world. We have also seen similar plans carried out in other worlds. In other religious traditions, uniformity will be encouraged by the visitors-what you might call a fundamental kind of religion based upon the past, based upon allegiance to authority and based upon conformity to the institution. This serves the visitors. They are not interested in the ideology and values of your religious traditions, only in their usefulness. The more that people can think alike, act alike and respond in predictable ways, the more useful they are to the collectives. This conformity is being promoted in many different traditions. The intent here is not to make them all the same but to have them be simple within themselves. In one part of the world, one particular religious ideology will prevail; in a different part of the world, a different religious ideology will prevail. This is entirely useful to your visitors, for they do not care if there is more than one religion so long as there is order, conformity and allegiance. Having no religion of their own that you could possibly follow or identify with, they will use yours to engender their own values. For they value only total allegiance to their cause and to the collectives and seek your total allegiance to participate with them in ways that they prescribe. They will assure you that this will create peace and redemption in the world and the return of whatever religious image or personage is considered of the greatest value here. This is not to say that fundamental religion is governed by alien forces, for we understand that fundamental religion has been well established in your world. What we are saying here is that the impulses for this and the mechanisms for this will be supported by the visitors and used for their own purposes. Therefore, great care must be given by all who are true believers in their traditions to discern these influences and to counteract them if possible. Here it is not the average person in the world that the visitors seek to convince; it is the leadership.",
        "text_source": "Using a genetic fingerprinting method on the infants, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues revealed in the British journal Human Reproduction, that genes from the donor cytoplasm are definitely present in some of the babies, along with those of the moms and dads. But the researchers are emphatic that the additional genes of the third-party donors are inconsequential and won't have any effect on the children's characteristics. Not so fast, say ethicists writing in the journal Science. The donated cytoplasm of these eggs contains more than just proteins to help the egg grow. It also holds mitochondria, the tiny structures that manufacture energy for the cells out of oxygen and nutrients. And mitochondria contain their own genetic material. The ethicists suggest that these experiments would never have been approved by the federal committee that oversees genetic work. But, because the work was privately funded, the researchers weren't required to get anyone's permission except the parents-all three of them. In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

They will not face them because of their anxiety, because of their fear. In fact, the reality of life in the universe, the encounter with life in the universe and the Intervention itself together represent the most denied reality in the world today. People will think, It is not important. I have my job. I have my family. I have, you know, my own daily problems. I mean, why should it matter to me? What are you talking about? If there is an Intervention going on in the world, do you think that it is not relevant to you and to your life and to what will happen to you? Do you see here? This is isolationist thinking. The Allies Briefings bring home the reality that humanity's isolation is over! But the isolationist thinking continues, unabated. Unless you have a direct encounter with forces from the Greater Community where your life is disturbed or upset in some way, well, you will just continue on thinking the way you have always thought, living upon the assumptions that you have always lived upon, oblivious to the greater realities that are shaping your life and destiny. And how can God reach you to tell you to become alert and aware, to make you responsive to these greater realities that are changing your life and destiny? People love the idea of a God out there that will throw them a life preserver when they are drowning, but the idea that God will interfere in their life and show them something they really don't want to see, well, that is really a test of faith, isn't it? That is exactly what is happening today. That is why the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality is in the world because this is God's message to alert humanity to this greater reality and to prepare humanity. The awareness is not enough. If the awareness engenders primary anxiety and fear, people will not know what to do. They will say, Oh, my God! What do we do? And they don't know what to do because they have never had to respond to this directly before. That is why God's message brings with it the preparation so people can begin to think like they live in a Greater Community. Then they can begin to become aware that there are Greater Community realities out there that are going to have a direct impact on them, their lives and their world. The preparation must give you this greater awareness and consciousness, this sensitivity. Otherwise, you are like an ant colony in a field that is about to be plowed under. And the poor ant colony has not a clue of what is about to happen. Up until the moment of their destruction, well, life will be as it has always been. But you are not ants, and you have a consciousness. You can consider the future, and you can think about things that are beyond your visible range. And you can consider yourself living within a larger arena of life, both within the world and beyond the world within a Greater Community. As you develop this Greater Community awareness, you begin to see that your world is a very special place, with wonderful attributes. And you may think, Well, of course others would be interested in our planet. And interested in us, not because we are magnificent but because we are the stewards of this place. We control this world.

        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

The human family, without even knowing it, is part of a Greater Coordination. It is something only the Wise can fully understand. And even here their comprehension of this great Network must remain incomplete. For what individual can know of a Network so vast, so complicated and coordinated from Higher and Greater Powers, subject to so many circumstances and changing conditions that it is beyond the capacity of any individual, or even group, to fully realize? But to know you are part of this Coordination, to carry out your duties as part of this Coordination, that is the mountain you must climb to learn of these things sufficiently. We speak of things now in service to the Revelation that is being given to the world, and its teaching about life in the universe in particular. For you must have testimony from the universe itself, and not from one race or individual alone, but from a greater Network representing countless races that function beyond the reach of governments and commerce; beyond the reach of ambitious individuals and groups and nations; beyond all of the corruption and manipulation that exist in this region of space, which is considerable and complicated and dangerous. We bring to you the reality of life in the universe as we see it and have known it. It is not simply our understanding, however, that we present to you here. It is the wisdom of the Networks of the Wise, who share their wisdom with one another through the Higher Powers. In this way, Heaven has its agents on the ground-here, there, everywhere, hidden, small groups and sometimes isolated individuals, but very well connected so that the wisdom that we provide can not only represent our individual experience or understanding, but the wisdom of the Wise throughout this part of the universe. There is no race that could understand the meaning of life fully in this universe, or understand fully that all beings living in the physical reality are living in a state of Separation from the Divine. The Revelation for your world now, and the Messenger sent for this purpose, can explain these things to you, for you need a human representative to do this for you. He too is part of the Greater Coordination, as is his family. They have been sent here as the seeds of the Greater Coordination in the world, not only to meet the great challenge of Intervention and the great challenges that humanity is facing, but also to accompany humanity's emergence into the Greater Community and to build this sacred bond here. For if humanity is to ever attain real freedom in the universe, or be able to maintain this freedom and to attain stability in this world with your environment, you will need this Greater Coordination here to maintain a higher level of Knowledge and, if possible, even to advise your future leaders.

        "text_source": "Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

        "text_target": " We have been anxious to speak more with you regarding the affairs of your world and to help you come to see, if possible, what we are seeing from our vantage point. We realize this is difficult to receive and will cause considerable anxiety and concern, but you must be informed. The situation is very grave from our perspective, and we think it would be a tremendous misfortune if people were not informed correctly. There is so much deception in the world that you live in, and in many other worlds as well, that the truth, though apparent and obvious, goes unrecognized, and its signs and messages go undetected. We, therefore, hope that our presence can help clarify the picture and help you and others to see what is truly there. We do not have these compromises in our perception, for we were sent to witness the very things that we are describing. Over time, perhaps you would be able to know these things on your own, but you do not have this kind of time. The time now is short. Humanity's preparation for the appearance of forces from the Greater Community is far behind schedule. Many important people have not responded. And the intrusion into the world has accelerated at a far greater pace than was originally thought to be possible. We come with little time to spare, and yet we come with encouragement for you to share this information. As we have indicated in our previous messages, the world is being infiltrated and the mental environment is being conditioned and prepared. The intention is not to eradicate human beings but to employ them, to have them become workers for a greater collective. The institutions of the world and most certainly the natural environment are valued, and it is the preference of the visitors that these be preserved for their use. They cannot live here, and so to gain your allegiance, they are employing many of the techniques that we have described. We will continue in our description to clarify these things. Our arrival here has been thwarted by several factors, not the least of which is a lack of readiness of those whom we must reach directly. Our speaker, the author of this book, is the only one with whom we have been able to establish a firm contact, so we must give our speaker the fundamental information. From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity.",
        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

        "text_target": "Throughout their Briefings, the Allies talk about the importance of human freedom and self-determination in an environment of tremendously powerful persuasion and inducements, particularly cast upon a young race emerging into this Greater Community of life, and how many other emerging races in the universe have fallen prey to Intervention such as we are facing now. We are unprepared for Contact with this Greater Community. For we can only imagine, through our media, film and science, what life might be like beyond our borders. But the picture that the Allies Briefings present is very different than what most people think of today. The Allies Briefings are grounded in the realities of life in our local universe and therefore present a much more accurate representation of what actually exists beyond us. From this, we can begin to see that the universe is an expression of the same reality of nature that we experience in our world. Yet it is nature occurring on a scale and a level of complexity beyond what we can imagine. As a result, the Allies Briefings emphasize that we can understand the reality of Intervention from our own experience of intervention here on Earth. Our history has shown us the evidence of intervention of one culture upon another, one nation upon another, repeatedly over time. This means that our own history and native wisdom can enable us to see and understand a great deal about who is here and why they have come. Yet there is much we cannot see and know about what life is like in our local universe, but which we would need to know if we are to understand who is visiting our world. To understand who is here and why they're here and what this means for us, we have to understand something about what life is like in the universe around us. We have to understand what would bring an Intervention here, what creates it, what strengthens it, what gives it power, what limits its power. The first three sets of Allies Briefings provide us this perspective very directly. The fourth set of Briefings builds upon this and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. With this, they reveal the great Spiritual Coordination that exists throughout the universe through which the Creator of all life supports spiritual development, awareness, unity and freedom in the universe. The Allies devote one of their Briefings to the Networks of the Wise, which represents individuals in many different worlds who are being guided by this Greater Coordination to support their world's freedom and well-being, creating a vast network through which wisdom can be sent from one world to another. The Allies reveal that they are part of this Network of the Wise. Throughout their Briefings, the Allies emphasize that we are now the native peoples of the Earth, facing Intervention from powers from beyond. To recognize this requires courage, clarity, objectivity and awareness. The time for this awareness and recognition has come. Our need is pressing and it is now. There are things we must know about life in the universe around us and about the nature and purpose of those intervening in our world today, which the Allies of Humanity are revealing to us. The Allies of Humanity emphasize that we must resist the Intervention through education, through awareness building, and through a growing human alliance and the empowerment of those who are seeing the Intervention's activities and who are being affected by them. To do this, the Allies emphasize that we must rely upon the power of our innate spiritual Intelligence within, which is called Knowledge. This greater Intelligence is humanity's inherent ability to see and to know the truth beyond fear and preference, to see and know the Intervention for what it really is. To enable us to gain access to this Knowledge, a preparation has been given to us from the Creator of all life called the Steps to Knowledge. This is the pathway of discovering Knowledge and building your connection to it in the context of the Greater Community.",
        "text_source": "  Endings   The crop circles present us with a view of the world that is rich with meaning and metaphor; they make visible the very designs of matter and life. The spaces they create are an invitation to come and take part in an exploration of these universal structures; to recognize the connection of all things in the patterned fabric of creation. They also seem to suggest that these shapes and patterns are an intimate part of our own thought processes; and that they are an archetypal structure upon which not only matter and life are based, but also lie at the heart of the structure of consciousness itself. That sense of familiarity the circles sometimes evoke \u2013 that uncanny feeling that you know what these shapes are and what they mean, and that they are somehow vitally important \u2013 make so much more sense when looked at from this viewpoint. The circles seem concerned with rebalancing our world-view and our sense of reality. In their own way, they are raising awareness of the fact that there is meaning as well as function behind creation, and that life and everything concerned with it has an innate purpose. No matter how you feel that the crop circles may have originated, they are bringing a richness and depth of inspiration to the fore. They 'en-soul' our world and breathe life and colour into the scientific machinery currently used to describe our universe. The circles seem to engender a view that such machinery is but the skeleton or bare bones of the universe, and that what we now need to understand is the flesh, the life-blood and heart of the wonderful creation around us. Is there more to this reality than we can currently see? A cursory glance over the rich legacy of legend and myth held by our world's many cultures suggests that there is far more to our reality than we currently acknowledge in our minds and hearts. The crop circles are our 'signs and wonders', our symbols and guides, our dreams and aspirations made manifest in the fields. They are a counterbalance to the mechanical and functional reality that the western world promulgates. They are mandalas of healing that have spread across the face of the earth; they are an unconscious expression of our need to re-order and reconsider. In our turbulent times, the human race is faced with many choices and many dilemmas, and is being asked to re-evaluate its attitudes towards numerous issues, especially war and the environment. Perhaps the crop circles are an outward sign that this process is firmly under way. Throughout this book we have looked at a whole gamut of components which may be behind the crop circles. We have looked at earth energies, pizo-electrical effects, magnetic effects and the link between vibration and the formation of shape. We have looked at the astonishing use of number symbolism encoded in the circles and what some of that might mean. There are many possibilities for the origins of the circles: earth spirits, extra-terrestrials, extra-dimensional intelligences, Gaia (the consciousness of the earth itself) or, of course, large-scale international hoaxing. Whoever the circle-makers are it is clear they prefer anonymity; it seems to me that they wish to be known by the quality of the fruits of their labour; the crop circles themselves. To be only interested in their identity, or the method by which the circles are made, seems somehow crude in comparison with the elegant and thoughtful works of art they put before us. The crop circles have resisted every attempt made to pin them down or explain them away, and after over fifteen years of being close to this phenomenon I have come respect that. There will always be people who are more interested in probing the circles scientifically, or those who want to spend their time with them building a case to prove or disprove the hoax theory. I am, however, content to sit, watch the the crop circles unfold and pay careful attention. The circles invite us on a journey of mutual exploration; I have the sense that neither side knows where it will end, but that the whole point of our interfacing is ultimately about the quality of the interaction. We began this book by searching for a state of focused openness, one in which we suspended our world-view in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the beautiful crop circles. I suggest that rather than giving up and grasping for any explanation of this amazing phenomenon, we strive to maintain our openness, and approach the circles with the patient attentiveness that their works of art so gracefully demand. Even if the mystery of the crop circles is never answered conclusively, they will leave an enduring impact on those who took the time to observe them. They will have changed forever their view of life and reality. And for those who may come long after the circles have disappeared, these pictures will serve as a snapshot of these difficult but hope-filled times. Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. July 1991.

        "text_target": " To assist you in sharing The Allies' Message and Briefings with others, we are including this 12-point summary of the four sets of Briefings. This summary represents only a general overview and does not include many of the important details which make complete comprehension of the Allies Briefings possible. 1. Humanity's destiny is to emerge into and to engage with a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe. 2. Contact with other forms of intelligent life represents the greatest threshold that humanity has ever faced. The results of this Contact will determine humanity's future for generations to come. This Contact is happening now. 3. Humanity is unprepared for Contact. Researchers are still unable to clearly see who is visiting our world and why. Governments are not revealing what they know, and most people are still in denial that this phenomenon is even occurring. 4. Because of this lack of preparation, humanity's true Allies sent representatives to a location near Earth to observe the extraterrestrial presence and activities within our world. The Allies of Humanity Briefings represent their report. 5. The Briefings reveal that our world is undergoing an extraterrestrial Intervention by forces who, as demonstrated by their actions, are here to subvert human authority and to integrate into human societies for their own advantage. These forces represent non-military organizations who are here to seek human and biological resources. The Allies refer to these forces as the Collectives. The Collectives do not value human freedom. 6. Because the Intervention is being carried out by small groups of intervening forces, it must rely primarily upon deception and persuasion to achieve its goals. The Allies Briefings describe in detail how this is being accomplished and what we must do to stop it. 7. This extraterrestrial Intervention is being focused in four arenas:  \tIt is influencing certain individuals in positions of power and authority in government, commerce and religion to cooperate with the Intervention through the promise of greater wealth, power and technology. It is creating hidden establishments in the world from which the Intervention can exert its influence in the mental environment, seeking to make people everywhere open and compliant to its will through a Pacification Program. It is manipulating our religious values and spiritual impulses in order to gain human allegiance to their cause. It is taking people against their will, and often without their awareness, to support an interbreeding program designed to create a hybrid race and a new leadership who would be bonded to the visitors. 8. Those extraterrestrial visitors who have been potentially beneficial to humanity have all retreated from the world in the face of the Intervention. Those remaining are alien races who are not here for our benefit. This leaves us in an unambiguous situation regarding the intentions and activities of the extraterrestrial presence. This enables us to clearly see what we are dealing with. Otherwise, it would be impossible for us to tell friend from foe. 9. The Allies Briefings emphasize the grave danger in our accepting and becoming reliant upon ET technology offered by the Intervention. This will only lead to our becoming dependent on the visitors, resulting in our loss of freedom and self-sufficiency. No true ally of humanity would offer this to us. The Allies emphasize that we have earth-based solutions to all the problems that we face. What we lack as a race are unity, will and cooperation. 10. In spite of the great challenge we now face, humanity still has a great advantage if we can respond in time. The Allies Briefings reveal both the Intervention's strengths and its weaknesses. One of the Intervention's weaknesses is its reliance upon human acquiescence and cooperation to achieve its goals. According to Greater Community rules of conduct within the region of space in which our world exists, Intervention is not allowed unless it can be demonstrated that the native people welcome and approve of it. Here our voices can have power in the Greater Community. At this moment, the Intervention has few critics. But if enough people can become aware of it and speak out against it, the Intervention will be thwarted and must withdraw. This is the first step in humanity's preparation for dealing with the realities of life in the universe. This step and all the steps that follow give humanity its one great chance to overcome its longstanding conflicts and to unite in its own defense for the preservation of the world. The Allies emphasize that we as human beings have the spiritual and collective power to do this, and that we must do this if we want to survive and advance as a free and independent race in the universe. 11. Preparation for our contact with the Greater Community begins with awareness, education, and Knowledge, our spiritual Mind. 12. In facing the Greater Community, humanity must build unity, self-sufficiency and discretion. These are the three requirements that all free nations must establish to be free in the universe.",
        "text_source": "The U.S. government-funded SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, which operates on the assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio waves out into the universe, illustrates this bias. The possibility that advanced intelligences might not choose to communicate with us through such a tiny or limited technological aperture, seeking perhaps some fuller opening of our consciousness, seems not to have occurred to its inventors. As philosopher Terence McKenna has suggested, \"To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant\" (McKenna 1991). It is not altogether clear to me why we become so attached to our ways of seeing the world. Perhaps a comprehensive scientific paradigm, like any ideology, gives a sense of mastery and power. Mystery and the sense of not knowing are antithetical to the need to maintain control and seem, at times, to inspire such terror that we fear that we might blow apart, like the frog in the Tibetan story when confronted with a universe too vast to comprehend. This might explain why it is the intellectual and political elite in our culture that seems most deeply wedded to perpetuating the materi alist view of reality. The UFO abduction phenomenon, which strikes at the heart of the Western paradigm and reveals us to be utterly without control, is more readily accepted at the grassroots level than by the culturally sophisticated or most intellectually advanced among us. For it is, to a large degree, the scientific and governmental elite and the selected media that it controls that determine what we are to believe is real, for these monoliths are the principal beneficiaries of the dominant ideology. This \"politics of ontology\" (Mack 1992) is then the primary arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our homes and abduct our people would create particular problems . This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories. There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the meaning of our \"power\" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik Erikson called .. pseudospeciation\"}, is the source of prodigious suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distraction from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking the phenomenon and its implications seriously. The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of economic \"indicators\" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called \"market forces\") is not controlled, inequities in the distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen, giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It does not, cannot, \"save\" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed, the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,, profoundly \"enlightening\" in the fullest sense. The UFO abduction phenomenon presents a particular problem for some organized religions. From the beginnings of history groups of human beings, recognizing the power and potential perils of spirit forces \"out there,\" have taken upon themselves the task of guiding us through the \"ultimate matters\" (Zock 1990) of life. Religious leaders instruct us in the nature of God, and determine for us what spirit beings or other entities may exist in the cosmos. The Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, for example, in its zeal to impose a particular sort of monotheism based on the Trinity, quite ruthlessly suppressed the nature-worshipping polytheism of much of Europe."

        "text_source": "Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear."

        "text_source": "From the earliest days of the modern outbreak of sightings some forty years ago, there is a quite remarkable similarity between the descriptions given by observers of the flying vehicles. It is the more remarkable that there have been tens of thousands of these reports, from observers who range from illiterate peasants in Argentina and Spain to people with Ph.D.s in other countries and they have all been given spontaneously- which has led to the generic term * 'flying saucer.\" It must be more than a coincidence. As for what I have called bizarre phenomena, I need only refer to the astounding geometrical effects in the Alti Piano in South America of what seem like gigantic airfields laid out in the days of prehistory by means which would tax today's technology to the limit. And to the pyramid effects, and to the so-called navigational beacons, which could only be of use to a craft approaching earth from outside the atmosphere. These are physical phenomena which exist, and can be touched and measured; and no one knows how they were made, nor by whom, nor for what purpose. Let me turn to some views on what I and many others believe to be the cover-up. There is no dispute that there have been at least two major investigations into UFOs in the United States in the last forty years, and there has been an acknowledged French government investigation since 1954, but there has been no public acknowledgment of anything similar in Britain or elsewhere. Nothing of substance has ever been disclosed about the US investigations, and though in France the government does seem to be more ready to take the public into its confidence, quite the reverse is true in both the United States and Russia, as many other official pronouncements have emphasized. While I cannot prove that there is a cover-up, I believe that Tim Good's book does so, certainly to my satisfaction. He shows beyond doubt that under the recent Freedom of Information Act in the USA, there are secret, even top secret, files on the subject which have not been released, and that what has fairly recently been released there, as the result of a court decision against the Government, is telling enough. There seem to me to be at least five possible explanations for a cover-up in the first rank, though there may well be others. The first possibility is that the UFOs are man-made, by one or both of the superpowers, and that their evident potential as weapons demands a degree of secrecy which makes Top Secret look like Beano. I must say that I simply do not believe this. If it were so, then I am sure that during my time as Chief of the Defense Staff I could not have failed to be let in on the secret, but I was not, and if I had been I should not be writing these words. Moreover, the enormous and very consistent weight of evidence from sightings, and even optical and radar measurements, make it clear enough to me that the technology of construction and propulsion of these devices is far in advance of even that of our space probes, never mind our manned space flights. I am certain that were such technology in actual use anywhere on earth it would have surfaced, either in war or, perhaps more likely, in industry. My final reason for rejecting this hypothesis is that I see no possible reason why, should these devices be man-made, the superpowers should not just say so. The man in the street could hardly be more frightened than he is already of nuclear weapons. Second, it has been put about that all the major powers are seeking to capture a UFO, to learn its secrets, and that if they admit or disclose the results of their investigations the general public will get into the act and muddle up their plans. Third, is a variant of that notion which holds that one or more powers actually have captured a UFO (Tim Good asserts plainly in Chapter 16 that this has been done in the USA) and fear that public interest will force them to disclose the fact before they have got their answers. Certainly if either of these unlikely explanations were true, and the results of the undoubted investigations were to be made public, it might just be possible for informed students of the subject to discover more than was thought to be good for them. For my part I reject out of hand either of these explanations, partly because, as with the first possibility, I think I should have known (and not be allowed to say so) but more practically because I just cannot believe that the secret would not have got out. Practically every other secret, of a .physical rather than a conceptual nature, is already widely known-though governments hate to admit it. The two further possibilities on my list are both based on fear: fear by governments of public reaction. The first possibility is that official investigations have disclosed or revealed quite a lot about UFOs, even including their origin, method of construction and propulsion, and just possibly their purpose. If this is so, and if the enormous literature is to be believed, plainly there exists no human defense against them, should they be hostile. It is suggested that governments believe this would cause such public \"alarm and despondency\" (as we used to say in the Second World War) as to have even farther reaching social and political effects than the current opposition to nuclear weapons. This, I must concede, is just possible, though I do not myself believe it. On the contrary I think that were it true, the public would be relatively unmoved. Either they would not believe it or, through apathy or fatalism, they would instead shrug their shoulders and get on with what in 1987 is the difficult business of just living, winning the pools, planning holidays or going on strike- or all four. The second of these last two possibilities is that investigations have disclosed that UFOs are not physical phenomena but paranormal, and they defy explanation. The reason for not disclosing these findings could then be reluctance to admit publicly that something very odd is going on, and that governments do not know what it is. If so, the same line of argument about public fear applies, and I would use the same counter- arguments as before. However these five possibilities may strike you, what seems to be common ground is that there have been thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of sightings and encounters, physical results and of the latter, by people all over the world whose evidence on any other subject would be accepted without question. There have been major investigations lasting thirty or forty years by the governments of the USA, Russia and France, for certain, and probably Britain and other countries. At the end of it all-today-we have no hard official information to weigh against some hundreds of books on the subject by private individuals or groups of individuals. I claim that the charge that there is a cover-up is thereby proved. What I admit defeats me is a plausible reason for it. This excellent book adds a great deal of evidence to the whole dossier, and I warmly commend it to all who are interested in what, to me at any rate, remains a fascinating enigma.

        "text_target": "It is wisest for you now to simply have an open mind and set aside the kind of cultural beliefs there may be regarding life beyond your world, to not be influenced by others' opinions, or the works of your governments, or the fantasies and speculation that exist around this great and important subject. The human family, without even knowing it, is part of a Greater Coordination. It is something only the Wise can fully understand. And even here their comprehension of this great Network must remain incomplete. For what individual can know of a Network so vast, so complicated and coordinated from Higher and Greater Powers, subject to so many circumstances and changing conditions that it is beyond the capacity of any individual, or even group, to fully realize? But to know you are part of this Coordination, to carry out your duties as part of this Coordination, that is the mountain you must climb to learn of these things sufficiently. We speak of things now in service to the Revelation that is being given to the world, and its teaching about life in the universe in particular. For you must have testimony from the universe itself, and not from one race or individual alone, but from a greater Network representing countless races that function beyond the reach of governments and commerce; beyond the reach of ambitious individuals and groups and nations; beyond all of the corruption and manipulation that exist in this region of space, which is considerable and complicated and dangerous. We bring to you the reality of life in the universe as we see it and have known it. It is not simply our understanding, however, that we present to you here. It is the wisdom of the Networks of the Wise, who share their wisdom with one another through the Higher Powers. In this way, Heaven has its agents on the ground-here, there, everywhere, hidden, small groups and sometimes isolated individuals, but very well connected so that the wisdom that we provide can not only represent our individual experience or understanding, but the wisdom of the Wise throughout this part of the universe. There is no race that could understand the meaning of life fully in this universe, or understand fully that all beings living in the physical reality are living in a state of Separation from the Divine. The Revelation for your world now, and the Messenger sent for this purpose, can explain these things to you, for you need a human representative to do this for you. He too is part of the Greater Coordination, as is his family. They have been sent here as the seeds of the Greater Coordination in the world, not only to meet the great challenge of Intervention and the great challenges that humanity is facing, but also to accompany humanity's emergence into the Greater Community and to build this sacred bond here. For if humanity is to ever attain real freedom in the universe, or be able to maintain this freedom and to attain stability in this world with your environment, you will need this Greater Coordination here to maintain a higher level of Knowledge and, if possible, even to advise your future leaders. For in a free nation, what leader would not want to have access to such great wisdom without being part of the Network itself? For those in political power are rarely involved in the great Networks because they are too heavily controlled and influenced by their governments.",
        "text_source": "The U.S. government-funded SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, which operates on the assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio waves out into the universe, illustrates this bias. The possibility that advanced intelligences might not choose to communicate with us through such a tiny or limited technological aperture, seeking perhaps some fuller opening of our consciousness, seems not to have occurred to its inventors. As philosopher Terence McKenna has suggested, \"To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant\" (McKenna 1991). It is not altogether clear to me why we become so attached to our ways of seeing the world. Perhaps a comprehensive scientific paradigm, like any ideology, gives a sense of mastery and power. Mystery and the sense of not knowing are antithetical to the need to maintain control and seem, at times, to inspire such terror that we fear that we might blow apart, like the frog in the Tibetan story when confronted with a universe too vast to comprehend. This might explain why it is the intellectual and political elite in our culture that seems most deeply wedded to perpetuating the materi alist view of reality. The UFO abduction phenomenon, which strikes at the heart of the Western paradigm and reveals us to be utterly without control, is more readily accepted at the grassroots level than by the culturally sophisticated or most intellectually advanced among us. For it is, to a large degree, the scientific and governmental elite and the selected media that it controls that determine what we are to believe is real, for these monoliths are the principal beneficiaries of the dominant ideology. This \"politics of ontology\" (Mack 1992) is then the primary arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our homes and abduct our people would create particular problems . This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories. There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the meaning of our \"power\" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik Erikson called .. pseudospeciation\"}, is the source of prodigious suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distraction from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking the phenomenon and its implications seriously. The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of economic \"indicators\" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called \"market forces\") is not controlled, inequities in the distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen, giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It does not, cannot, \"save\" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed, the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,, profoundly \"enlightening\" in the fullest sense. The UFO abduction phenomenon presents a particular problem for some organized religions. From the beginnings of history groups of human beings, recognizing the power and potential perils of spirit forces \"out there,\" have taken upon themselves the task of guiding us through the \"ultimate matters\" (Zock 1990) of life. Religious leaders instruct us in the nature of God, and determine for us what spirit beings or other entities may exist in the cosmos. The Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, for example, in its zeal to impose a particular sort of monotheism based on the Trinity, quite ruthlessly suppressed the nature-worshipping polytheism of much of Europe."

        "text_target": "Throughout their Briefings, the Allies talk about the importance of human freedom and self-determination in an environment of tremendously powerful persuasion and inducements, particularly cast upon a young race emerging into this Greater Community of life, and how many other emerging races in the universe have fallen prey to Intervention such as we are facing now. We are unprepared for Contact with this Greater Community. For we can only imagine, through our media, film and science, what life might be like beyond our borders. But the picture that the Allies Briefings present is very different than what most people think of today. The Allies Briefings are grounded in the realities of life in our local universe and therefore present a much more accurate representation of what actually exists beyond us. From this, we can begin to see that the universe is an expression of the same reality of nature that we experience in our world. Yet it is nature occurring on a scale and a level of complexity beyond what we can imagine. As a result, the Allies Briefings emphasize that we can understand the reality of Intervention from our own experience of intervention here on Earth. Our history has shown us the evidence of intervention of one culture upon another, one nation upon another, repeatedly over time. This means that our own history and native wisdom can enable us to see and understand a great deal about who is here and why they have come. Yet there is much we cannot see and know about what life is like in our local universe, but which we would need to know if we are to understand who is visiting our world. To understand who is here and why they're here and what this means for us, we have to understand something about what life is like in the universe around us. We have to understand what would bring an Intervention here, what creates it, what strengthens it, what gives it power, what limits its power. The first three sets of Allies Briefings provide us this perspective very directly. The fourth set of Briefings builds upon this and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. With this, they reveal the great Spiritual Coordination that exists throughout the universe through which the Creator of all life supports spiritual development, awareness, unity and freedom in the universe. The Allies devote one of their Briefings to the Networks of the Wise, which represents individuals in many different worlds who are being guided by this Greater Coordination to support their world's freedom and well-being, creating a vast network through which wisdom can be sent from one world to another. The Allies reveal that they are part of this Network of the Wise. Throughout their Briefings, the Allies emphasize that we are now the native peoples of the Earth, facing Intervention from powers from beyond. To recognize this requires courage, clarity, objectivity and awareness. The time for this awareness and recognition has come. Our need is pressing and it is now. There are things we must know about life in the universe around us and about the nature and purpose of those intervening in our world today, which the Allies of Humanity are revealing to us. The Allies of Humanity emphasize that we must resist the Intervention through education, through awareness building, and through a growing human alliance and the empowerment of those who are seeing the Intervention's activities and who are being affected by them. To do this, the Allies emphasize that we must rely upon the power of our innate spiritual Intelligence within, which is called Knowledge. This greater Intelligence is humanity's inherent ability to see and to know the truth beyond fear and preference, to see and know the Intervention for what it really is. To enable us to gain access to this Knowledge, a preparation has been given to us from the Creator of all life called the Steps to Knowledge. This is the pathway of discovering Knowledge and building your connection to it in the context of the Greater Community.",
        "text_source": "Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions. Following the publication of the Allies of Humanity Book One in 2001, the Allies provided a second set of Briefings to complete their vital message to humanity. The Allies of Humanity Book Two, published in 2005, presents startling new information on the interactions between races in our local Universe and on the nature, purpose and most hidden activities of those races who are interfering in human affairs. The Allies initiated communication again in 2008, further describing the complex environment into which humanity is emerging. The third set of Briefings was published in 2012. Communicated in October 2016, the fourth set of Briefings builds upon the earlier briefings and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. The Allies of Humanity Book Four was published in 2019. Thanks to those readers who felt the urgency of the Allies' message and translated the Briefings into other languages, there is an expanding worldwide awareness of the reality of the Intervention. We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": "I will briefly outline the types of experiences that could be placed in this category. Of overriding importance is the shift that needs to occur in the relationship between the experiencer and the alien beings before consciousness-altering information can be received. Although the relationship with the aliens may have been playful, even intimate, in early childhood, it tends to change to a more disturbing and traumatic one as puberty approaches and the reproductive hybrid \"project\" begins. As traumatic intrusions take place, the abductees tend to feel themselves to be victims of hostile beings who regard them coldly, or simply as specimens in a project that serves the needs of the aliens. They may feel betrayed by the alien beings as the nature of their interaction changes. But as our work deepens, especially as the power of this extraordinary alien encounter is acknowledged and the abductees come to accept their lack of control of the process, the frightening and adversarial quality of the relationship seems to give way to a more reciprocal one in which more mutual human-alien communication can take place. The abductees may even experience a profound love for the alien beings-in some ways more powerful than the love they experience in human relationships-and may feel that this love is returned. Connection through the eyes seems to play an important part in the evolution of this process. Whereas, for example, the abductees felt bitterly resentful about having their sperm and eggs used by the aliens in the hybridization project, they may come to feel that they are participating in a process that has value for the creation and evolution of life. There are those who might argue that such a shift in stance by the abductees in the face of the ongoing helplessness of the abduction situation is in fact a defensive shift, even self-delusion in the service of mitigating pain and distress. It could be considered an attempt by the ego to retain a sense of mastery by giving away voluntarily what will be taken by force, or an attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance by believing that the emotional cost of such a traumatic experience can be balanced by providing something good and positive for the universe. On the other hand, it is possible that working through the shattering experience of the abduction may give abductees access to experiences of transpersonal meaning, universal love, and connectedness that make such compassion possible. \u00b7 As is true of so many aspects of the abduction phenomenon, it is difficult in the area of transformational or spiritual growth- related experiences to separate cause and effect, or even to think in causal terms at all. Does an abductee, for example, receive (and communicate) information about a past life experience because his consciousness is open to the possibility of such matters? Or will the emergence into consciousness of the memory of a past life, itself facilitated by our work together, bring about an expanded personal horizon and a broadening of the sense of self in relation to the larger fabric of universal consciousness? The fact that the relationship between the abductees and the aliens can evolve so dramatically over time makes me question categorizations of the beings into constructive, good, and loving ones and others that are deceptive and hostile, bent on taking over our planet-the idea that the light beings are good or caring, for example; the grays are businesslike and indifferent. This kind of taxonomy smacks suspiciously of the sorts of polarization that characterizes human group or ethnonational relationships and could have little to do with the way interspecies or interdimensional relationships, if their actuality were to become established, might work beyond the earth. Furthermore, it is common for abductees to experience, for example, both light beings and little grays (Arthur, chapter 15) or reptilian and other sorts of beings (Carlos, chapter 14 ), during the same abduction. It is possible that we are dealing with relationship processes that are evolutionary in nature and not comprehensible in the linear terms of our familiar polarities. Types of experience during abductions that appear to be related to personal growth and transformation are as follows: 1. \"Pushing through\" occurs, i.e., fully experiencing the terror and rage associated with the helplessness and intrusive instrumentation on the ships. When this takes place acknowledgment and acceptance of the power of the experiences becomes possible and a more reciprocal relationship follows in which personal growth and learning can take place. From the \"ego death\" follow other levels of transformation: 2. The aliens may be perceived as intermediaries or intermediate entities between the fully embodied state of human beings and the primal source of creation or \"God\" (in the sense of a cosmic consciousness, rather than a personified being). In this regard abductees sometimes liken the alien beings to angels, or other \"light beings\" (including the \"grays\"). 3. The abductees may actually experience themselves as returning to their cosmic source or \"Home,\" an inexpressibly beautiful realm beyond, or not in, space/time as we know it. When this occurs during a hypnosis session, powerful, inexpressibly joyous, even orgiastic feeling occurs. Conversely, abductees may weep with sadness when they experience having to leave their cosmic home, return to Earth and become embodied once again. 4. \"Past lives\" are experienced during the sessions with strong emotion appropriate to what material is emerging. This is most likely to occur when the investigator picks up on cues in the sessions during which encounters from infancy are being reexperienced. Complaints or simply observations of being here on Earth \"again,\" of being \"back\" or having \"returned\" are voiced (about which I then inquire). The \"past lives\" that emerge seem to have relevance to the personal development or evolution of the experiencer, as I have seen in the cases of Dave and Joe. 5. Past life experiences provide abductees (and the investigator) with a different perspective about time and the nature of human identity. Cycles of birth and death over long stretches of time can thus be relived, providing a different, less ego derived sense of the continuity of life and the smallness of an individual lifetime from a cosmic perspective. Consciousness is experienced as not coterminous with the body; the notion of a soul with an existence separate from the body becomes relevant. 6. Once the separateness of consciousness from the body is grasped, other kinds of \"transpersonal\" experiences become possible; identification of consciousness with virtually endless kinds of beings and entities through space/time and beyond often occurs. Paul (chapter 10), among my cases for example, found himself during our sessions identified with dinosaurs or dinosaur-like reptiles from another era and experienced himself present at the site of a UFO crash several decades ago when alien beings were destroyed by human fear and aggression. Another abductee, a young Brazilian man, found that his alien encounters opened him to the identification with the myths and spirit entities of his culture's folklore, from which his Western scientific and intellectual training had cut him off. 7. A distinct but important aspect of this kind of transpersonal experience is an abductee 's sense of possessing a double human/alien identity. In their alien selves they may discover themselves doing many of the things that the \"other\" aliens have done to them and to other human beings, such as studying their minds or even carrying out reproductive procedures. The alien identity seems to be connected in some way with the soul of the human self, and one of the tasks the abductee then confronts is the integration of their human and alien selves, which takes on the character of a reensoulment of their humanity. 8. The reliving of abduction material leads abductees to open to other realities beyond space/time, realms that are variously described as beyond a \"veil\" or some other barrier which has kept them in a \"box\" or in a consciousness limited to the physical world. When asked about these experiences abductees have trouble finding the words to describe what has occurred and speak of the \"collapse\" of space/time, of the nonrelevance of the notions of space and time, and of being in multiple times and places at the same moment. The result of all these experiences for abductees is the discovery of a new and altered sense of their place in the cosmic design, one that is more modest, respectful, and harmonious in relation to the earth and its living systems. Emotions of awe, respect for the mystery of nature, and a heightened sense of the sacredness of the natural world are experienced along with deep sadness about the apparent hopelessness of Earth's environmental crisis. One of John Carpenter's cases described herself as having become a \"child of the universe\" after she had become conscious of her abduction experiences. The meaning and implications of these shifts of consciousness for possible human futures will be discussed more fully in the case examples and in the concluding chapter. The thirteen cases presented in this book--eight men and five women-were selected from the seventy-six abductees I have interviewed on the basis of the following criteria: 1. Their stories, although in some instances complex, seemed to me sufficiently clear to permit a coherent narrative."

        "text_source": "It seems to many UFO abduction investigators that the latter remark describes precisely what seems to be lacking in both the ETs and in the transgenic beings we believe they are coproducing with our involuntary help. The evidently cloned children with alien-human appearance that Jen saw on the playground seemed passive, expressionless, and unused to the simplest of sensations-like the feel of sand trickling through one's fingers. It's no wonder these transgenic children seen aboard craft might be described as having the failure to thrive syndrome. They seem thin, listless, and nonresponsive. Do the aliens expect these children to take their places in our society as Mr. Paige and Damoe evidently did? Or do these children represent an interim stage in an overall alien plan to develop beings more like us in many ways-with our vital genetic diversity and our emotions, which actually have a survival purpose in our society. Or perhaps we flatter ourselves with this speculation, and all the ETs are interested in is getting the technical part right. They seem to have gone a long way toward producing serviceable facsimiles of humans who answer to them. The models seem to be getting better and better. The old debate still rages on over what is the most powerful influence to shape human beings (or any sentient being): Is it nature or nurture? But it's possible that both our great human vulnerability and our strength lies in our ongoing desire to attend to both equally. We earthlings value our science; we don't mind tinkering with nature if it seems to confer some genetic advantage on us, rather than the next guy; we're even drawn to some of the more radical new abilities of genetics to make designer babies free of defects. But we know that nature won't paint the whole picture, either-that these small bundles of neurons, muscles, blood, and bone, these offspring of ours, will also grow out of the environment we create and the examples we set. We will need to intentionally nurture our children into becoming loving, empathetic, and ethical adults, responsible to the rest of society. But what happens to a species like ours that might become infiltrated by a subpopulation of bioengineered people who never knew the nurturance side of the equation? ETs may be on the way to creating an increasingly perfect facsimile of a human being, but we don't yet see convincing evidence that they understand what lies behind the scenery of a fully fleshed-out human existence-qualities such as emotional openness, the courage to act independantly as a moral being, the desire to nurture others as you were once nurtured-or to nurture another person even if you were not. We don't know if this new variant species of mankind, intentionally created by the Other, is here to offer us earthlings fresh knowledge and profound insights from the farside of the cosmos, or whether it intends to deliberately betray us into the service of its own extraterrestrial creators. In the meantime, it seems that all we can do is to continue to bear witness and offer modest emotional support-through conversations, letters, phone calls, and writing-to the thousands of people undergoing these experiences. We, as well as the abductees, look toward the day that it dawns on the scientific, political, educational, and spiritual institutions of this small planet that their understanding and guidance are terribly lacking in dealing with this strange experience that touches every dimension of what it means to be human."

        "text_source": "'That's impossible ! I've got to see this for myself.\" They set off together. When the frog from the well saw the ocean, it was such a shock that his head just exploded into pieces. -Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying When we look back our lives seem to possess a coherence, and even a progression, of which we were hardly aware as events unfolded. When the UFO abduction phenomenon flrst came to my attention, my curiosity was aroused, and I had a sense that something unusual was happening within me. But I had little notion of the extent to which my explorations would open my consciousness to vast mysteries and uncertainties. And I did not foresee how fundamentally challenged the view of the world in which I had been raised would be. Each of the thirteen people whose cases are described in this book-indeed each of the seventy-six abductees with whom I have worked-tells a unique story. The injdividual differences can probably be accounted for on the basis of the diverse personalities of the experiencers and the varieties of circumstances within the abductions themselves. But what I have found to be so extraordinary from the beginning of my study has been the readily identifiable patterns that emerge when the case narratives are examined carefully. It may be argued that it is my own mind that has created this coherence, and that I have shaped and interpreted data in line with a structure that I already have in mind. In response to this criticism, I can only state that the abduction phenomenon was, in the beginning, as unbelievable to me as it is to any skeptic and that I have tried to be aware of any inclination to form new beliefs and convictions that might take the place of previous ones that have been so radically \u00b7called into question. One of the reasons I chose to include so many cases in such great detail is my desire to weave a tapestry of sufficient richness to give readers the opportunity to make their own judgments about the abduction phenomenon. I cannot say that the cases selected have been \"typical,\" because I do not know what a typical case would be, or even that there is such a thing as a typical case. I do believe, however, that the cases I have discussed are illustrative of the range of phenomena that characterize abduction experiences. There are aspects of UFO abductions that do not obey the physical laws of the universe as we have known them. Some of the phenomena might be understood at some future time through great advances in physics. But others, such as the capacity abductees like Paul discover to move their consciousness through space and time, require another ontological paradigm. I do not expect that the material presented in this book will have much impact on the minds of those who believe that the laws of physics as encompassed by the Newtonian/Einsteinian system are the full definition of reality. I hope, however, that the data contained here is of sufficient power and solidity to enable those who are open to expanding their view of possible realities to consider that the world might contain forces and intelligences of which we have hardly allowed ourselves to dream. \"When I turn the lights out at night, this has been the show for the past week. I can see it with my eyes closed as well as open.\" -Anne (see page 403)  WAYS OF KNOWING: METHODOLOGY In physics, psychology, and other fields the data we obtain is a function of the way we have gone about the task of gaining information. In my own discipline of depth psychology, Freud and his followers, using their insights into the contents and structure of the human unconscious gained through the analysis of dreamsquite overlooked in the rationalist neuropsychology of his timederived the application of hypnosis in medical psychology and the method of free association. The development of new ways of knowing requires, however, something more than the application of different technologies or tools. Rather, an expanded epistemology, especially in psychology, may demand the legitimization (or relegitimization) of neglected aspects of ourselves as instruments of knowing. Although psychoanalysis has been responsible for great advances in our knowledge of human experience and the depths and structure of the psyche, it has retained as a way of knowing a good deal of the dualistic, subject/object split that characterizes Western empirical science, including psychology. The patient or client is generally regarded as someone with a problem, separate from the therapist/investigator; the patient is to be helped or studied. Indeed, Freud eventually turned away from hypnosis as a way of working with his patients in part because of the subjective bias it seemed to introduce into the therapeutic process (Mack 1993) rather than recognizing the inherent intersubjectivity of psychodynamic clinical work (Stolorow 1992) and continuing to struggle with the demand for analytic rigor that this requires. Alternative therapies and investigations of human consciousness appear to share an expanded use of the psyche as part of the exploratory process. The feelings and spirit of the facilitator in alternative therapeutic situations, as well as his or her rational mind and observational skills, are a vital aspect of the therapeutic or investigative method. This expanded use of the self relies on empathy and is, in essence, intersubjective. Within this framework hypnosis, shamanic journeys, meditation, Grof breathwork, vision quests, and other modalities, which are called in the West \"nonordinary\" states of consciousness, become natural investigative allies. For they involve, by definition, the opening of the psyche to the deeper realms that lie behind the rational or observing mind. In the end, of course, the rational intellect is essential for understanding and integrating the data obtained through the fuller use of consciousness as an investigative tool. But along the waywe-as investigators or readers-must open ourselves through this expanded way of knowing to whatever the patient or subject may report to be his or her experience. It is perhaps understandable, therefore, that I would have, in effect, \"stumbled\" upon the UFO abduction phenomenon and that I was then more or less prepared to take on its investigation in the context of my training in the Grof holotropic breathwork method (see chapter I ), which relies upon the use of the whole selfmind, body, and soul-in the exploration of unconscious human experience. In working with abductees, the investigative method I have developed is basically a combination of the old and the new. In addition to standard interviews I use hypnosis, which was Freud's original \"nonordinary\" state for investigating the unconscious, modified by the use of the breath for centering and deepening the process. In my work with abductees I am fully involved, experiencing and reliving with them the world that they are calling forth from their unconscious. My whole psyche or being is engaged; naturally the rational or observing self is always present, shaping, limiting, and protecting the process. The empirical methods of Western science rely primarily on the physical senses and rational intellect for gaining knowledge, and downplay feeling and intuition. They were developed in part to avoid the subjectivity, contaJ.llination, and sheer messiness of human emotion. Yet the cost of this restricted way of knowing may be that we now learn about the physical world with pnly limited use of our faculties. In order to learn about the worlds \"beyond the veil,\" as abductees put it, we may need a different kind of consciousness. This means that the process of gaining information about abductions is, to a large degree, participatory, even \"cocreative.\" By this I do not mean that I impose beliefs of my own about the phenomenon upon the experiencers, am leading or \"coaching\" them, or even that I believe literally everything an abductee says. As much as possible my questions in the sessions derive from what has just been said, or my intuition, based on experiences in therapy not only with abductees, but hundreds of patients, about where I feel the inner experience of the abductee is going. I avoid leading questions, and abductees, in my experience, are quite difficult to lead (they all seem to feel, as Sheila said, \"I know what I saw\"). Yet, at the same time, I cannot avoid the fact that a cocreative intuitive process such as this may yield information that is in some sense the product of the intermingling or flowing together of the consciousness of the two (or more) people in the room. Something may be brought forth that was not there before in exactly the same form. Stated differently, the information gained in the sessions is not simply a remembered \"item,\" lifted out of the experiencer's consciousness like a stone from a kidney. It may represent instead a developed or evolved perception, enriched by the connection that the experiencer and the investigator have made. From a traditional dualistic perspective this might be called \"distortion\"; from a transpersonal point of view the experiencer and I may be participating in an evolution of consciousness. When we are dealing with a phenomenon like alien abductions, which manifests in the physical world but may derive from some other reality, the question of whether hypnosis (or any other nonordinary modality that can help us access realities outside of or beyond the physical world) discloses accurately what literally or factually \"happened\" may be inappropriate (see Appendix A for a fuller discussion of this matter). A more useful question would be whether the investigative method can yield information that is consistent among experiencers, carries emotional conviction, and appears to enlarge our knowledge of phenomena that are significant for the lives of the experiencers and the larger culture."

We do not involve ourselves with the daily lives of individuals in the world. We do not attempt to persuade governments or to lay claim to certain parts of the world or to certain resources that exist here. Instead, we observe, and we wish to report what we observe, for this is our mission in being here. The Unseen Ones have told us that there are many people today who feel a strange discomfort, a sense of vague urgency, a feeling that something is going to happen and that something must be done. Perhaps there is nothing within their daily sphere of experience that justifies these deeper feelings, that verifies the importance of these feelings, or that gives substance to their expression. We can understand this because we have been through similar things ourselves in our own histories. We represent several races joined together in our small alliance to support the emergence of Knowledge and Wisdom in the universe, particularly with races that are on the threshold of emerging into the Greater Community. These emerging races are particularly vulnerable to foreign influence and manipulation. They are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding their situation and understandably so, for how could they comprehend the meaning and the complexity of life within the Greater Community? That is why we wish to play our small part in preparing and in educating humanity. In our first discourse, we gave a broad description of the visitors' involvement in four areas. The first area is the influence on important people in positions of power in governments and at the head of religious institutions. The second area of influence is on people who have a spiritual inclination and who wish to open themselves to the greater powers that exist in the universe. The third area of involvement is the visitors' building of establishments in the world in strategic locations, near population centers, where their influence on the mental environment can be exercised. And lastly, we spoke of their program of interbreeding with humanity, a program which has been underway for quite some time.",
        "text_source": "Using a genetic fingerprinting method on the infants, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues revealed in the British journal Human Reproduction, that genes from the donor cytoplasm are definitely present in some of the babies, along with those of the moms and dads. But the researchers are emphatic that the additional genes of the third-party donors are inconsequential and won't have any effect on the children's characteristics. Not so fast, say ethicists writing in the journal Science. The donated cytoplasm of these eggs contains more than just proteins to help the egg grow. It also holds mitochondria, the tiny structures that manufacture energy for the cells out of oxygen and nutrients. And mitochondria contain their own genetic material. The ethicists suggest that these experiments would never have been approved by the federal committee that oversees genetic work. But, because the work was privately funded, the researchers weren't required to get anyone's permission except the parents-all three of them. In short, no one knows what effect these third-party genes will have on the new babies-except for the fact that these children have now been permanently genetically altered. Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

Still, the story resonates with me, simply because I know the source, as well as a few things about the career of this officer. Consider what eons and eons might mean. After Disclosure, these other beings are still likely to be so far ahead of us that open contact between us and them, open communication of any sort, might well remain inconceivable. The irony of Disclosure could well be that we will continue to have many unanswered questions about exactly who and what we are dealing with. We will have gotten to a point where we can prove to ourselves openly as a society that they are here, yes. But that is different from being able to grab hold of a live one for open study. Fighting the black budget world would probably offer the most hope on this matter, but it may well take an extended struggle to make that happen, perhaps many years. It is also quite possible that whatever bodies are being held make up only a small piece of the grand puzzle of what constitutes these Others. Very likely, the real action after Disclosure will be dealing with issues internal to our own society. It may well be that at least some of these beings have established a residence on our world. There is certainly reason to believe, gained from countless insider leaks and claims, that there is communication of some sort between them and the black budget community. There are also claims, and good reason to consider, that some of them have insinuated themselves into our society, perhaps even our power structure. Why would that be so illogical? On the contrary, it would seem to be entirely logical. They would know that humanity is on the fast track, and that when we get to the point where we might prove to be a genuine annoyance, all the more reason for them to have their own people on the inside. In the post-Disclosure world, this question will be raised more than once. There will be no easy way around it. Disclosure of the UFO reality will force our civilization to resolve many longstanding challenges and problems. Looking at only a few of these, it is easy to see why secrecy on this matter has been paramount for so long. Uncovering it will be the most revolutionary act in human history. The Long View   Looking further ahead into the future, we can discern some contours of that distant shore. It will be a world with an open recognition of the presence of other, alien intelligences here on Earth, interacting with this planet and humanity. That will be out in the open. Whether they will be out in the open is another matter altogether. But its open acknowledgement will be a great spur to our intellectual development. The dominant technologies a century from now will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to recognize today. Computing power and artificial intelligence will be orders of magnitude greater. Human beings themselves are likely to be different in many ways. Placing a value judgement on this is probably pointless. For better or worse, we are on the cusp of a great change. We will see changes not merely to our technological infrastructure, but probably to our own species via gene therapy and other forms of biotech. The basic intelligence of at least a portion of humanity (the very well-to-do) is likely to increase greatly. Envisioning the future in such a world is difficult. In all likelihood, we will still have families, love relationships, and a physical need for food, sleep, and sex. On that basis, we may assume that humans a century from now will share basic traits with us. Yet, how much do we have in common today with a medieval peasant or a paleolithic hunter-gatherer? Certain things, yes, but we also inhabit a vastly different mental universe. It seems likely that our great-great grandchildren, at least some of them, will be that far ahead of us."

They have an agenda, an interest, which they are not willing to share, at least not publicly.

Then there is the matter of nanotechnology and quantum computing, the results of which are expected to transform our world even more completely than the internet revolution already has. In other words, humanity is in the process of reinventing itself. Any observing intelligence must be well aware that we are poised, knowingly or not, to leap into their world. We have probably been there all along, only asleep. Now we are about to wake up."

We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": "Even when active experimentation in the laboratory is precluded, as in astronomy, the astronomer can still 'extract the signal from the noise' by the use of special instrumentation when the phenomenon (such as an eclipse) becomes available to him. Relationships between certain parameters associated with the phenomenon thus become apparent, and further testing and experimentation can then establish them beyond all reasonable doubt. They become a 'scientific fact'. If it were not possible to operate in the above fashion, science would be immensely more difficult; it would be virtually impossible to extract and separate the fundamental elements inherent in the phenomenon from the host of irrelevant and coincidental things always present in an observed situation. This is the situation in the case of die UFOs, which are totally beyond experimental control. Moreover, they are transient, unscheduled, and obtrude upon an observer who is often not competent to make a dispassionate analysis of the totally unexpected and surprising situation. Consequentiy, the significant features of the phenomenon may be buried among incidental - but much more conspicuous - features emphasized in the reports. UFOs, however, are not alone in this category; they share these particular difficulties with many other phenomena, such as ball lightning and meteorites, for which one must rely on the fortuitous observations of the layman for one's data. That is why subjects such as these gained scientific respectability so slowly, particularly when an explanation was hard to find because the phenomenon did not fit the scientific framework of the moment. We may even have to face the fact that the scientific framework, by its very internal logic, excludes certain classes of phenomena, of which UFOs may be one. One of the most exasperating and even repugnant features of the subject is its apparent irrationality. However, as our concept of rationality is a by-product of the scientifically oriented society in which we live, it should not surprise us if a phenomenon that is inaccessible to scientific procedure appears irrational. It is just here that we encounter a second difficulty of the UFO problem. It cannot, at least at present, be separated from the social condition in which it is embedded. We are accustomed to the almost complete isolation of the behavioral sciences from the physical sciences, yet in this problem we have a situation in which the two are inextricably mixed. Whether or not separate, nontrivial physical and behavioral components will emerge as serious study by both disciplines remains to be seen, but it would be premature to reduce the importance of either. Of course, this discussion would be unnecessary if an obvious explanation of UFOs was at hand. In one's frustration it is all too easy to seize on an explanation of the 'men from Mars' variety and to ignore the many UFO features unaccounted for. But to do this is to fall into the very trap we have just discussed. We may be inadvertently and artificially increasing the significance of the conspicuous features while the part we ignore - or that which is not reported by the untrained witnesses - may contain the clue to the whole subject. What needs to be explained has been amply outlined in the descriptions of the six basic UFO observational prototypes given in Chapters Six through Eleven. The most persistent and enigmatic features seem to be the localization of the phenomenon in space and time, its apparently intelligent characteristics (of a rather puerile kind), its appearance of operating outside the established laws of physics, and its peculiar preferences for certain situations. The frequently reported presence of 'humanoids' capable of moving about in comfort in our highly restrictive terrestrial environment, and their association with 'craft', exhibiting at times near-zero inertial mass yet able to leave physical traces of their presence, is surely a phenomenon beyond the pale of mid-twentieth century physics. But there will surely be, we hope, a twenty-first century science and a thirtieth century science, and perhaps they will encompass the UFO phenomenon as twentieth century science has encompassed the aurora borealis, a feat unimaginable to nineteenth century science, which likewise was incapable of explaining how the sun and stars shine. We work in the brilliant spotlight of the present, only dimly conscious of the penumbra of the past and quite unable to illuminate the darkness of the future. Let us imagine for a moment a covered wagon train of not much more than a century ago, winding its long journey to the west. It is encamped for the night, its wagons in a circle, sentries posted, and the travelers gathered about a campfire for warmth and cheer. Someone speaks of the future, but he speaks, as he must, with the words and concepts of his day. But even were he inspired by some kindly muse of the future to speak of making their entire journey in a matter of hours, flying through the air, and of watching scenes by television and hearing voices speaking on another continent, this gifted one could not have put into words a glimmer of how these wondrous things might be accomplished. The vocabulary for such descriptions - electrons, transistors, integrated circuits, jet engines - the jargon vehicle of technical communications would not yet exist for yet a century. He would be helplessly incoherent for want of words as vehicles for his thoughts. Would one care to venture a guess at the technical vocabulary of the year 373,475 (assuming intelligent life still exists on earth) and to predict the concepts and knowledge for which it will be a vehicle? Does such an advanced knowledge and technology already exist somewhere in space? The sun, our parent star, is but one star out of billions in our galaxy, and our galaxy is but one of many millions, each with its billions of stars. It is statistically improbable that our sun is the only star out of quadrillions of stars to have planets. That would be somewhat like claiming that acorns can be found lying near only one oak tree in the world. Even if we limit our thinking to the billions of stars in our galaxy alone, we know that our galaxy was in existence for billions of years before our sun appeared. Thus the stage was set long ago for this possibility, the possibility of civilizations as greatly advanced beyond us as we are beyond mice. For instance, Fred Hoyle1 has conjectured that it is possible that a great intragalactic communications network exists but that we are like a settler in the wilderness who as yet has no telephone. Such ideas, once forbidding and even revolting to our geo centric minds, no longer shock us as we slowly grow out of ou cosmic provincialism. Such concepts, however, have little to da directly with our problem at the moment save that they presenl one possible hypothesis for study. But talk of extraterrestria visitors or the more esoteric notions of time travel or of parallel universes is as inappropriate as the mass hallucination hypothesis for UFOs at this stage. Kuhn has commented that] scientific progress tends to be revolutionary rather than evol-j utionary, and the above concepts are, despite their bizarre nature, merely imaginative extensions of current concepts. When the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, I believe that it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science but a mighty and totally unexpected quantum jump.

The human family, without even knowing it, is part of a Greater Coordination. It is something only the Wise can fully understand. And even here their comprehension of this great Network must remain incomplete. For what individual can know of a Network so vast, so complicated and coordinated from Higher and Greater Powers, subject to so many circumstances and changing conditions that it is beyond the capacity of any individual, or even group, to fully realize? But to know you are part of this Coordination, to carry out your duties as part of this Coordination, that is the mountain you must climb to learn of these things sufficiently. We speak of things now in service to the Revelation that is being given to the world, and its teaching about life in the universe in particular. For you must have testimony from the universe itself, and not from one race or individual alone, but from a greater Network representing countless races that function beyond the reach of governments and commerce; beyond the reach of ambitious individuals and groups and nations; beyond all of the corruption and manipulation that exist in this region of space, which is considerable and complicated and dangerous. We bring to you the reality of life in the universe as we see it and have known it. It is not simply our understanding, however, that we present to you here. It is the wisdom of the Networks of the Wise, who share their wisdom with one another through the Higher Powers. In this way, Heaven has its agents on the ground-here, there, everywhere, hidden, small groups and sometimes isolated individuals, but very well connected so that the wisdom that we provide can not only represent our individual experience or understanding, but the wisdom of the Wise throughout this part of the universe. There is no race that could understand the meaning of life fully in this universe, or understand fully that all beings living in the physical reality are living in a state of Separation from the Divine. The Revelation for your world now, and the Messenger sent for this purpose, can explain these things to you, for you need a human representative to do this for you. He too is part of the Greater Coordination, as is his family. They have been sent here as the seeds of the Greater Coordination in the world, not only to meet the great challenge of Intervention and the great challenges that humanity is facing, but also to accompany humanity's emergence into the Greater Community and to build this sacred bond here. For if humanity is to ever attain real freedom in the universe, or be able to maintain this freedom and to attain stability in this world with your environment, you will need this Greater Coordination here to maintain a higher level of Knowledge and, if possible, even to advise your future leaders. For in a free nation, what leader would not want to have access to such great wisdom without being part of the Network itself? For those in political power are rarely involved in the great Networks because they are too heavily controlled and influenced by their governments.",
        "text_source": "In this worldview the various spirit entities, God or gods and other mythic beings that peoples throughout the world, including in our own culture, experience as altogether real have no objective reality. They are the subject matter of psychology and psychopathology, anthropology, religious study, and science fiction, the projection outward of the perceptions and images of the brain. If we make these entities real, it is through metaphor and symbol, as poets do so well. To acknowledge that the universe (or universes) contains other beings that have been able to enter our world and affect us as powerfully as the alien entities seem able to do would require an expansion of our notions of reality that would all too radically undermine the Western scientific and philosophical ideology which Tulane philosopher Michael Zimmerman calls \"naturalistic humanism\" (Zimmerman 1993). The alien beings that appear to come to us from the sky in strange spacecraft present a particularly confusing challenge to such a naturalistic or objectivist ideology. For they seem to partake of properties belonging to both the spirit and the material worlds, bridging, as if effortlessly, the division between these realms which has become increasingly sacred and unbreachable since science and religion went their separate ways in the seventeenth century (Toulmin 1990). On the one hand these beings seem able to be seen by the abductees, who feel their bodies moved and find small lesions inflicted upon them. On the other hand the beings seem to come, like intermediaries from God or the Devil, from a nonembodied source, and they are able to open the consciousness of abductees to realms of being that do not exist in the physical world as we know it. Before concluding I will speculate about why the barrier between the spirit and material worlds has become so entrenched in the West. For it is this pos1 sibly false dichotomy that makes our confrontation with beings who do not respect this gulf so shocking. SPIRITUAL IMPLICATIONS I am often asked how experiences that are so traumatic, and even appear cruel at times, can also be spiritually transformative. To me there is no inconsistency here, unless one reserves spirituality for realms of the sublime that are free of pain and struggle. Sometimes our most useful spiritual learning and growth comes at the hands of rough teachers who have little respect for our conceits, psychological defenses, or established points of view. Zen Buddhist teaching is notorious for its shock treatment methods. One might even go further and argue that genuine spiritual growth is inevitably disturbing, as the boundaries of consciousness are breached and we are opened to new domains of existence. This does not, of course, \"forgive\" the cruelties associated with the abduction phenomenon. The alien beings that abductees speak about seem to many of them to come from another domain that is felt to be closer to the source of being or primary creation. They have been described, however homely their appearance, as intermediaries or emissaries from God, even as angels, by Carlos for one. The acknowledgment of their existence, after the initial ontological shock, is sometimes (see Peter 's and Catherine's cases, for exrunple) the first step in the opening of consciousness to a universe that is no longer simply material. Abductees come to appreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itself intelligent. They develop a sense of awe before a mysterious cosmos that becomes sacred and ensouled. The sense of separation from all the rest of creation breaks down and the experience of oneness becomes an essential aspect of the evolution of the abductee's consciousness, as Joe spoke of in relation to his own and his baby son's development. Joe felt the choice he was facing was, as he put it, between oneness and insanity. The aliens themselves may come to be seen as a split-off part of the abductee's soul or Self; his or herown reensoulment requires the integration of this separated dimension. Many abductees with whom I have worked, including several not written about in this book, experience a kind of ecstasy which, as in Carlos's case, can reach orgasmic proportions as they feel themselves open through their experiences (or the reliving of them) to a divine source or creative center of being in the cosmos. This source is, to the abductees, inexpressibly luminous and filled with color, and they may weep when they find themselves in its presence, for separation from it was painful beyond words. When they do open to the source once again, they may call the experience a \"return\" and protest once again having to fulfill even a newly agreed upon purpose as a human being."

        "text_target": "It is humanity's ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity's Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence. If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new. This is why learning the Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people. This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction. As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies' message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people's inability to respond. It's like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just don't know anything. And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, Well, it's just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them. This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all. Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing. Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it's not happening. There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to. Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth. There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth. Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone!",
        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

If we, or anybody else, have recovered saucer wreckage, and done scientific measurements of the flight capability of these objects and their apparent ability to control the behavior of humans from a distance (as demonstrated by the many good abduction cases), we would try to make sure that no one else could find out what we have managed to learn. We would also be very serious about trying to determine, with the use of spies, satellite observations, and electronic eavesdropping, what others have learned on their own, and what they have learned about what we have managed to achieve in these areas. For instance, the National Security Agency is a large and competent worldwide eavesdropper, and sophisticated reconnaissance satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office monitor all kinds of foreign activities in secret. Past experience says the use of disinformation and misinformation would be standard practice, as in all military confrontations. It doesn't take much study of all the wars to see this. An important part of many sports is the ability to fake out one's opponents. Remember that the basic rule is that one cannot tell one's friends without telling ones enemies, because they also read the papers, watch TV, and so on. 6. The people in charge in all countries would be trying to predict what would happen if statements were publicly made that indeed aliens are visiting. It would be dependent on the framework in which the information was presented: Would all countries have to join together to make such an announcement? If they did, how would earthlings respond? 7. Over and over again people have suggested that the major reason information has not been revealed is fear of panic, as dramatized by the Orson Welles's radio broadcast in 1938 of H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds. Right? Personally, I don't think it is. First of all, War of the Worlds was presented as Martians destroying earthlings. What could we (before the space age, nuclear weapons, jet fighters, and so on) possibly do against Martians? If the story had been true, people would have had a legitimate reason to panic. But what if the existence of aliens were presented as peaceful visits by powerful, advanced societies who could obviously have long since destroyed us if they had a mind to do so? Suppose we were told that they were here for a variety of peaceful reasons from a variety of civilizations, all much more technologically and sociologically advanced than we are. For, if they hadn't learned to live in peace with other civilizations, they would have already been destroyed themselves-or, much more frightening, they would have subjugated or destroyed all the others. 8. If the persons making such an announcement were highly respected, or at least not considered threatening in the way that the presidents of the United States, USSR, and China might be considered (say, the Queen of England or the Pope), and added that international conferences were planned to consider the religious, economic, and political implications of the visitations, that might help. If there were suggestions that the aliens could help us heal the sick, feed the starving, and redistribute the wealth, this would be a threat to the powerful and a boon to the weak. You see, I presume that in all areas of technology (because we are so young on a cosmic timetable), our visitors are superior; not just in flying, but in eavesdropping, communications, medicine, and computation. I wonder what their reaction would be to the cover story on USA Today on November 6, 2007, noting that the average annual salary of major college football coaches exceeded $1,000,000. But 30,000 children died yesterday of preventable disease and starvation. No front-page headlines for them. 9. I presume that if such an announcement were made, no matter how carefully, church attendance would go up, mental hospital admissions would go up, and the stock market would go down (as uncertainty is always the enemy). I further expect, based on more than 600 college lectures, that many in the younger generation would immediately push for an earthling orientation, rather than the nationalistic ones that are the rule on this planet. To some, that would be great. After all, we are all earthlings. But, unfortunately, I can't think of any national government that would want its citizens to owe their primary allegiance to the planet instead of that individual government. Nationalism is the only game in town. People in power have a nasty habit of wanting to stay in power."

        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_target": "Throughout their Briefings, the Allies talk about the importance of human freedom and self-determination in an environment of tremendously powerful persuasion and inducements, particularly cast upon a young race emerging into this Greater Community of life, and how many other emerging races in the universe have fallen prey to Intervention such as we are facing now. We are unprepared for Contact with this Greater Community. For we can only imagine, through our media, film and science, what life might be like beyond our borders. But the picture that the Allies Briefings present is very different than what most people think of today. The Allies Briefings are grounded in the realities of life in our local universe and therefore present a much more accurate representation of what actually exists beyond us. From this, we can begin to see that the universe is an expression of the same reality of nature that we experience in our world. Yet it is nature occurring on a scale and a level of complexity beyond what we can imagine. As a result, the Allies Briefings emphasize that we can understand the reality of Intervention from our own experience of intervention here on Earth. Our history has shown us the evidence of intervention of one culture upon another, one nation upon another, repeatedly over time. This means that our own history and native wisdom can enable us to see and understand a great deal about who is here and why they have come. Yet there is much we cannot see and know about what life is like in our local universe, but which we would need to know if we are to understand who is visiting our world. To understand who is here and why they're here and what this means for us, we have to understand something about what life is like in the universe around us. We have to understand what would bring an Intervention here, what creates it, what strengthens it, what gives it power, what limits its power. The first three sets of Allies Briefings provide us this perspective very directly. The fourth set of Briefings builds upon this and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. With this, they reveal the great Spiritual Coordination that exists throughout the universe through which the Creator of all life supports spiritual development, awareness, unity and freedom in the universe. The Allies devote one of their Briefings to the Networks of the Wise, which represents individuals in many different worlds who are being guided by this Greater Coordination to support their world's freedom and well-being, creating a vast network through which wisdom can be sent from one world to another. The Allies reveal that they are part of this Network of the Wise. Throughout their Briefings, the Allies emphasize that we are now the native peoples of the Earth, facing Intervention from powers from beyond. To recognize this requires courage, clarity, objectivity and awareness. The time for this awareness and recognition has come. Our need is pressing and it is now. There are things we must know about life in the universe around us and about the nature and purpose of those intervening in our world today, which the Allies of Humanity are revealing to us. The Allies of Humanity emphasize that we must resist the Intervention through education, through awareness building, and through a growing human alliance and the empowerment of those who are seeing the Intervention's activities and who are being affected by them. To do this, the Allies emphasize that we must rely upon the power of our innate spiritual Intelligence within, which is called Knowledge. This greater Intelligence is humanity's inherent ability to see and to know the truth beyond fear and preference, to see and know the Intervention for what it really is. To enable us to gain access to this Knowledge, a preparation has been given to us from the Creator of all life called the Steps to Knowledge. This is the pathway of discovering Knowledge and building your connection to it in the context of the Greater Community.",
        "text_source": "Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people from around the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs and philosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generational divides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as to priorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized many people around the world into permanent suspicion against global political elites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is our technology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply getting access to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced. Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filed online every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance are hundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there are thousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered and overwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incredible field. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history of UFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspect of the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Trying to make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone's pet project for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has been heating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are on the brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "The Allies of Humanity Briefings give us a greater perspective and a deeper understanding of our destiny within a larger panorama of intelligent life in the universe. In order to achieve this, the Allies do not speak to our analytical mind but to Knowledge, the deeper part of our being where the truth, however clouded, can be directly discerned and experienced. The Allies of Humanity will raise many questions, which will require further exploration and contemplation. Its focus is not to provide names, dates and places but to provide a perspective on the ET presence in the world and on life in the universe that we as human beings could not otherwise have. While still living in relative isolation on the surface of our world, we cannot yet see and know what is happening regarding intelligent life beyond our borders. For this we need help, help of a very extraordinary kind. We may not recognize or accept such help at first. Yet it is here. The Allies' stated purpose is to alert us to the risks of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life and to assist us in successfully crossing this great threshold in such a way that human freedom, sovereignty and self-determination can be preserved. The Allies are here to advise us of the need for humanity to establish our own rules of engagement during this unprecedented time. According to the Allies, if we are wise, prepared and united, we will then be able to take our destined place as a mature and free race in the Greater Community. Over the course of time that this series of Briefings occurred, the Allies repeated certain key ideas that they felt were vital to our understanding. We have maintained these reiterations in the Briefings in order to preserve the intention and integrity of their communication. Because of the urgent nature of the Allies' message and because of the forces in the world that would oppose this message, there is a wisdom and a necessity to these repetitions. Following the publication of the Allies of Humanity Book One in 2001, the Allies provided a second set of Briefings to complete their vital message to humanity. The Allies of Humanity Book Two, published in 2005, presents startling new information on the interactions between races in our local Universe and on the nature, purpose and most hidden activities of those races who are interfering in human affairs. The Allies initiated communication again in 2008, further describing the complex environment into which humanity is emerging. The third set of Briefings was published in 2012. Communicated in October 2016, the fourth set of Briefings builds upon the earlier briefings and focuses on freedom in the universe, how it is achieved, how it is maintained and the restraints humanity will have to adhere to in order to become a free race in the universe. The Allies of Humanity Book Four was published in 2019. Thanks to those readers who felt the urgency of the Allies' message and translated the Briefings into other languages, there is an expanding worldwide awareness of the reality of the Intervention. We at The Society for the New Message consider that these four sets of Briefings contain one of the most important messages being communicated in the world today. The Allies of Humanity books are not just more speculating about the UFO/ET phenomenon. Collectively, they are a genuine transformational message aimed directly at the underlying purpose of the alien Intervention in order to raise the awareness that we will need to face the challenges and the opportunities that lie ahead.",
        "text_source": "  \"I envision expeditious development of the proposal to establish a lunar outpost to be of critical importance to the U.S. Army of the future. This evaluation is apparently shared by the Chief of Staff in view of his expeditious approval and enthusiastic endorsement of initiation of the study\", General Trudeau wrote to the chief of ordnance in March 1959, in support of the army's \"Project HORIZON\", a strategic plan for deploying a military outpost on the surface of the moon.. It was the army's most ambitious response to the threat from extraterrestrials and, by the time I arrived at the Pentagon, it was one of the projects that General Trudeau had handed off to me to get moving. \"The boys at NASA are taking over the whole rocket launching business, Phil\", he said. \"And the army's not even getting the scraps left on the table. \" I had just left the White House when the National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed in 1958, and I knew what that had portended. It transferred the responsibility of space from the military services to a civilian run agency that was supposed to fulfill the U.S. promises to other countries for the demilitarization of space. It was a laudable goal, anyone would argue : demilitarize space so that countries could explore and experiment without the risk of losing their space vehicles or satellites to hostile activities. For the United States and the Russians the agreement meant that our respective astronauts and cosmonauts wouldn't make war on each other. Good idea. But someone forgot to tell it to the extraterrestrials, who had been systematically violating our planet's airspace for decades, if not centuries, and had already set up a base of operations on the moon. For General Trudeau and much of the U.S. military command, the Soviets' ability to put high payload vehicles and cosmonauts into orbit with relative ease was a frightening prospect. Unless the United States challenged Soviet technology with our own ongoing launch program and expanded our satellite surveillance, the army believed it would cede an all important strategic advantage to the Soviet Union. By 1960, we were reaching a critical juncture. Because of the development window and the time it took to get projects through development, programs started too late in the 1960s would be hopelessly obsolete by 1970, when the Soviets were expected to have established a presence in space. As in the U2 program, we had another agenda that concerned us more than just the Soviets' ability to threaten us with a nuclear missile capability from space. We were also very much aware of the ability of a dominant military power on Earth to establish its own version of a treaty with extraterrestrials. We had already seen how Stalin negotiated a separate non-aggression pact with Hitler, allowing the Germans to stabilize its Eastern front and invade Western Europe. We didn't want to see Khrushchev gain so much unchallenged power in space that the extraterrestrials would readily agree to some kind of accommodation with him guaranteeing both of them a degree of freedom to dominate the political affairs of our planet. This may seem paranoid now, in the 1990s, but in the late 1950s this was exactly the thinking of the military intelligence community. General Trudeau's concerns were the concerns of anybody who knew the truth about an alien presence around our planet and their abilities to drop on top of us from out of nowhere just like they had done in Roswell, in Washington, D.C., in 1952, and in countless other places around the world. And we didn't know if any one of these sightings could turn into a full-fledged landing in force or if an invasion hadn't already begun. If they could turn the Soviet government into a client state with a proxy army, there might be no checking their ability to exercise their will to colonize our planet, appropriate our natural resources, or, if the cattle mutilations and stories of abductions were true, conduct with complete impunity an organized experimentation or testing program on the life forms of this planet. In the absence of any information to disprove our fears, it was the military's obligation to project the worst possible scenario. That's why the army pushed for Project HORIZON. We had to have a plan. The Horizon documents were straight forward in expressing their concerns : We needed to put a fully armed military outpost on the moon first because if the Soviets achieved this objective before we did, we would be in the position of having to storm a hill or secure a military position. We would rather be the defenders of a strongly fortified enclave than the attackers. Our outpost had to be strong enough to withstand an assault and have enough personnel to conduct scientific experiments and continual surveillance of the earth and its airspace. Initially, General Trudeau argued, the outpost must be of sufficient size and contain sufficient equipment to permit the survival and moderate constructive activity of from ten to twenty personnel at a minimum. It must allow for expansion of the permanent facilities, resupply, and rotation of personnel to guarantee the maximum amount of time for a sustained occupancy. The general not only wanted the outpost to establish a beach head on the moon, he wanted it to be permanent and able to sustain itself for long periods without support from the earth. Therefore, location and design were critical and required, in the army's view, a triangulation station of moon to Earth baseline space surveillance system that facilitated:  (1) communication with and optimum observation of the earth,  (2) routine travel between the moon and the earth,  (3) the best possible exploration capability not only of the immediate area of the lunar surface but long range exploration expeditions and, most importantly from the army's perspective,  (4) the military defense of the moon base. The army's primary objective was to establish the first permanent manned installation on the moon and nothing less. The military potential of the moon was paramount, but the mission allowed for an ongoing investigation of the commercial and scientific potentials of the outpost as well. The army wanted to make Horizon conform to existing national policy on space exploration, even insofar as the demilitarization of space was concerned. But it was tough because all of us in the military services who had come in contact with the Roswell file believed that we were already under some form of attack. Demilitarizing space only meant playing into the hands of a culture that had displayed a hostile intent toward us. But we also realized that overtly establishing a military presence in space would encourage the Soviets to match us step for step and result in an arms race in outer space that would exacerbate Cold War tensions. Armaments in space might be more difficult to control, and the chance of an accidental military exchange could have easily precipitated a crisis on Earth. Thus, the whole problem of what to do about establishing a military presence in space was a conundrum. Horizon was the army's attempt to accomplish its military objectives within the context of the government's demilitarization policy. The army faced another obstacle in its plans from the members of the Roswell working group who were still establishing and enforcing policy at levels above top secret. The working group correctly saw that any independent military expedition into space, especially for the purpose of establishing an outpost on the moon, had a high probability of encountering extraterrestrials. In this encounter, there was no guarantee that a military exchange would not ensue or, at the very least, a military report would be filed. Even if these reports were kept top secret, given the military bureaucracy and the presence of legislative oversight it was highly unlikely that the press would not learn about military encounters with aliens. Thus, the basic premise of the working group and its entire mission, the camouflage of our discovery of alien life forms visiting and probably threatening Earth, would be undermined and years of successful operations might easily be brought to an unsatisfactory end. No, the working group would rather have the exploration of space in the hands of a civilian agency whose bureaucracy could be more easily controlled and whose personnel would be handpicked, at least at the outset, by the members of the working group."

The occurrence of crop circles has made this approach rather difficult, so with no end to the science\u2013hoax stalemate in sight, we either choose to suspend all further work indefinitely or we have to transcend the argument altogether. The interesting thing is that when you do loosen the tether on this dyadic state of affairs, you find that the symbolism and geometry of the circles is, in fact, a third way of probing their nature. No obstacle is put in your way, save the limits of your own imagination; the crop patterns are open-ended statements which you are free to explore at will. Once this change in emphasis is engaged (from 'who' and 'how', to 'what' do they mean) the circles suddenly and magically unfold before your eyes. If it was not so bizarre, one might be forgiven for thinking that this is exactly what they want us to look at \u2013 not how they are made, or by whom \u2013 but what they might be saying. After over fifteen years of following the crop circles closely, investigating and experiencing hundreds of them in person, I can honestly say that I do not know who makes them all or how \u2013 and I don't even know exactly why. But what I can tell you is that I have come to believe through their symbolism, geometry and metaphor that the crop circles represent or make visible some of the oldest and deepest questions man has ever asked. They appear as mirrors; pictures of our state of mind or of our aspirations, dreams and even, at times, our doubts and fears. To gaze at the circles is to gaze upon the mystery of mankind."

Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective.

I have spoken about the silence of the human structure of power, but the beings who are traversing the skies, oceans, and space above the Earth are not landing on the proverbial White House lawn. They have an agenda, an interest, which they are not willing to share, at least not publicly. Many people claim to have had private communications with some of these beings, which run the gamut from the hellish to the divine. Regarding their nature and agenda, we enter of necessity the realm of speculation. Matters of exopolitics , that is the study of our relationship with them, will always be premature under such circumstances. Still, it is not outrageous to consider that, having mastered certain technologies that we ourselves may soon be acquiring \u2013 or even certain matters of mental or spiritual attainment \u2013 that multiple groups are interested in our beautiful blue orb and its abundance of life. The human species should be of prime interest to them, especially now. Consider the changes we have made to ourselves and the world within a mere century. From a world of horse-drawn carriages to cars, airplanes, radio, television, atomic weapons, guided missiles, integrated circuits, computers, and internet. An object weighing just a few ounces can let you speak, text, or see anyone in the world, hold thousands of songs, give you instant directions to anywhere, and connect you to the world's largest libraries. Experts in artificial intelligence believe we are just a few years away from having computers that will claim to be conscious in some manner, and will seem like they are, whatever the nature of that consciousness may truly be. Then there is the matter of nanotechnology and quantum computing, the results of which are expected to transform our world even more completely than the internet revolution already has. In other words, humanity is in the process of reinventing itself. Any observing intelligence must be well aware that we are poised, knowingly or not, to leap into their world. We have probably been there all along, only asleep. Now we are about to wake up."

There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity.",
        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

        "text_source": "This would seem to be a wonderful thing. Replacing oil is one of humanity's most coveted dreams. By now, everyone understands that the long-term future of our species, and our world, cannot include oil as our main source of energy. It pollutes horribly and harms life on Earth. A better, cleaner, more abundant source of energy would surely be more desirable, except from the point of view of those people who own the oil industry, some of the most powerful people in the world. For generations, they have monetized oil. What if the source of energy behind UFOs is impossible to centralize, and therefore harder to exploit for money? Aside from that, oil is the foundation of our world. Even under the most ideal conditions, transitioning out of an oil-dominated world would have a volatile effect on the global stock market and economic system. After all, most of the value of any consumer product is determined by the amount of energy that went into making and transporting it. Generally, that means oil. Therefore, if we say nothing else, we can conclude that the UFO phenomenon poses a threat to the established economic order: specifically to those wealthiest people and groups that own the greatest shares in the petroleum industry, and in general to the financial markets that would be shaken by the end of the oil era. Religious Implications   What would the admission of a UFO reality do to religion? Would it mean anything at all? The answer is yes, it would certainly mean something. Of course, the world has many different religions, so everything would depend on which one we mean. Still, to the extent that any religion deals with the creation of the world, the creation of mankind, and to the extent to which people today continue to believe in versions of those accounts, the UFO phenomenon has profound implications. This will be especially evident after we review the history of ancient UFOs, or ancient aliens, in the next chapter. Because, if it appears that they have been with us for a long time, many people will inevitably wonder if they were the gods of ancient times, or even God himself? It doesn't take an excess of imagination to see things in this way when reviewing the Hebrew Scriptures, for instance. Time and again, the God of the Israelites directly intervened to save the day, and had a very personal relationship with Moses. Other parts of that collection are also suggestive of aliens and their technology. The vision of Ezekiel comes to mind, in which the prophet beheld a wondrous apparition of angels in a flaming chariot in the sky. When you consider the ideas of the various ancient alien theorists, we naturally ask whether beings from elsewhere became our so-called gods and were instrumental in creating human religions. For practicing Christians, probably the most sensitive question would be: was Christ an extraterrestrial? What would it mean if he had been?"

        "text_source": " by Dr. Edgar Mitchell, ScD, and Dr. Bruce Maccabee, PhD   The fact of an extraterrestrial presence on and around Earth for at least half of the 20th century has been increasingly accepted in the United States and much of the Western world in recent times, albeit slowly. This has happened in spite of continuous efforts of political, military, and cultural authorities in the United States and other nations to obscure and even deny that fact through the release of distorted and false information pertaining to sightings and other reports. Discovery that we are not alone in the universe must rank, for us humans, as one of the most portentous events in our entire history. Only in the time of generations now living has our own technology progressed to the point that we can venture off our planet, and also create the means necessary to view the vastness of the cosmos as no generations before us have done. Debate about the propriety, morality, and even legality of such official denial and cover-up of these events in a free and open society will likely continue for some decades. Justifications involving national security, potential use of the knowledge by military opponents, public unrest, and even fear of public uprisings may be invoked by those seeking to defend these policies. The fact that the now-famous Roswell UFO crash occurred shortly after World War II, the most widespread and disastrous war in history, and following the first use of nuclear weaponry in war-weaponry that was initially tested at the nearby White Sands Proving Grounds-provided ample grounds for military concerns. Whether these were valid concerns has yet to be determined. However, in the context of the cold war era, it is understandable that the military and intelligence communities might have been concerned that the aliens were hostile, yet were unable to do anything about their presence, and thus would not want the public to know. (The famous radio program War of the Worlds had been broadcast on the East Coast of the United States only a few years earlier, causing widespread panic.) Additionally, in light of the recovery of an alien craft at Roswell, the military and intelligence communities would not want America's Cold War enemies to know we had gained access to an advanced technology that might be used by the United States to deliver weapons. So there may have been sound reasons for enforcing a cloak of secrecy, denial, and misdirection about UFOs. But if so, one must wonder why the policy continues today, when the public is well informed and largely accepting of the subject. Irrespective of how one views the pros and cons of 60 years of official denial of alien presence on and around our planet, the truth has slowly seeped out into public awareness and acceptance, due in part to many of the inane stories and contradictions offered by official sources. Mostly, however, discovery of the truth has been due to the dedication, thoroughness, and capabilities of a handful of investigators such as Stanton Friedman. A 40-year veteran in the pursuit of truth about UFOs, Stan Friedman has used his knowledge of science, his training as a nuclear physicist, and his penchant for digging persistently to discover the facts, sifted from an excess of fantasy and misinformation, to become a major figure in the effort to disclose the presence and activities of our alien visitors. His work and his writing in this field deserve the very highest acclaim. -Edgar Mitchell, ScD, Captain USN (ret.) Lunar Module Pilot, Apollo 14   Sixth man on the moon   \"UFO believers are 99 44/100% kooks.\" The editor of the technical journal Applied Optics wrote that opinion in a letter to me about publishing my short article on the then-internationally famous New Zealand sightings of December 1978. Despite his reservations about \"UFO believers,\" he did allow publication, even though my article claimed that the light that had been seen was unidentified. He also allowed publication of a second article by scientists who disputed my claim, and then a third article-by me-that rebutted the second article. There are some more details of this following, but the complete story and the published articles are available at http: //brumac.8k. The publication of three short articles discussing one of the New Zealand sightings is one of the few times-or perhaps the only time-that a specific UFO case has been discussed in a point-counterpoint manner in the refereed scientific literature. The reluctance to publish discussions of UFO reports and the previously stated opinion of the editor of Applied Optics illustrate the low opinion that the general scientific community (but not all scientists) has of UFO sightings and \"ufology\" (the study and analysis of UFO sightings and associated phenomena) in general. The tendency of scientists to reject UFO reports as being spurious sightings by untrained observers, [claiming that sightings are] all explainable as misidentifications, hoaxes, or delusions, goes way back to the beginning, in late June of 1947, when experienced pilot Kenneth Arnold, who had about 4,000 hours of flying time, reported seeing many unidentified semicircular-shaped objects fly past Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams in the state of Washington. They had no recognizable aircraft features (no wings, no vertical stabilizers, no engines). He said they flew with a wobbling or skipping motion, comparable to that of a spinning disc skipping over the water. (A newspaperman converted the description of the flight dynamics to a description of the objects themselves and called them \"flying saucers.\" The name stuck, even though Arnold didn't say they looked like saucers.) Within a few weeks of Arnold's report, which was published throughout the United States, there were hundreds of other reports of strange objects flying through the sky. The U.S. Army Air Force began collecting reports and publicly stated that \"they aren't ours.\" Air Force spokesmen admitted that they didn't know what was causing the sightings. Over the next few years the Air Force claimed that most of the sightings could be explained as prosaic phenomena (weather phenomena, birds, misidentified airplanes, stars or planets, hoaxes, and so on), and the ones that couldn't be explained simply didn't have enough information to allow identification of the phenomena. The Air Force also said to the general public (and to the scientific community), \"Don't worry, we are working on it, and we haven't found anything yet.\" They added that there seemed to be no evidence of a threat from flying saucers. The scientific community considered the sightings from two points of view: theoretical and experimental. There was no theory that could explain the generally reported characteristics of saucers: typically circular or semicircular in shape, ability to alternately fly at high speed or hover, little or no evidence of propulsion mechanisms, and silent or nearly silent when hovering or traveling. (Note: all high-speed flight we humans have achieved depends upon the rapid combustion of fuel. Combustion makes noise, as in the cylinders of a piston engine, in the turbine of a jet, or in the combustor of a rocket. Balloon-borne craft can be very quiet, but they also don't move very fast.) Some of the Air Force scientists and engineers working on the newest propulsion devices initially considered the possibility that the unexplainable saucers might be atomic-powered Soviet flying machines that were based on advanced designs developed by the Germans in WWII. They soon dropped this idea because they were certain that the Soviets would not allow secret, advanced devices to fly over the United States, where they might crash and their secrets could be discovered. With \"advanced Soviet devices\" ruled out, that meant that the saucer reports resulted from misidentifications, hoaxes, or delusions. There was no theoretical reason to allow for a fourth possibility: flying craft made \"elsewhere\" (in other words, not from Earth). The chief theoretical reason against this possibility was essentially that the distances between Earth and other hypothetical planets are so great that \"they can't get here from there.\" The theory was that it would take too much time and energy to build a fleet of flying saucers (or \"motherships\" analogous to aircraft carriers) to travel from some other star system to ours. (In more recent years, Stanton Friedman has disputed this theoretical objection to extraterrestrial saucers in his lectures, and now he does it in this book.)"

And even here their comprehension of this great Network must remain incomplete. For what individual can know of a Network so vast, so complicated and coordinated from Higher and Greater Powers, subject to so many circumstances and changing conditions that it is beyond the capacity of any individual, or even group, to fully realize? But to know you are part of this Coordination, to carry out your duties as part of this Coordination, that is the mountain you must climb to learn of these things sufficiently. We speak of things now in service to the Revelation that is being given to the world, and its teaching about life in the universe in particular. For you must have testimony from the universe itself, and not from one race or individual alone, but from a greater Network representing countless races that function beyond the reach of governments and commerce; beyond the reach of ambitious individuals and groups and nations; beyond all of the corruption and manipulation that exist in this region of space, which is considerable and complicated and dangerous. We bring to you the reality of life in the universe as we see it and have known it. It is not simply our understanding, however, that we present to you here. It is the wisdom of the Networks of the Wise, who share their wisdom with one another through the Higher Powers. In this way, Heaven has its agents on the ground-here, there, everywhere, hidden, small groups and sometimes isolated individuals, but very well connected so that the wisdom that we provide can not only represent our individual experience or understanding, but the wisdom of the Wise throughout this part of the universe. There is no race that could understand the meaning of life fully in this universe, or understand fully that all beings living in the physical reality are living in a state of Separation from the Divine. The Revelation for your world now, and the Messenger sent for this purpose, can explain these things to you, for you need a human representative to do this for you. He too is part of the Greater Coordination, as is his family. They have been sent here as the seeds of the Greater Coordination in the world, not only to meet the great challenge of Intervention and the great challenges that humanity is facing, but also to accompany humanity's emergence into the Greater Community and to build this sacred bond here. For if humanity is to ever attain real freedom in the universe, or be able to maintain this freedom and to attain stability in this world with your environment, you will need this Greater Coordination here to maintain a higher level of Knowledge and, if possible, even to advise your future leaders. For in a free nation, what leader would not want to have access to such great wisdom without being part of the Network itself? For those in political power are rarely involved in the great Networks because they are too heavily controlled and influenced by their governments.",
        "text_source": "'That's impossible ! I've got to see this for myself.\" They set off together. When the frog from the well saw the ocean, it was such a shock that his head just exploded into pieces. -Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying When we look back our lives seem to possess a coherence, and even a progression, of which we were hardly aware as events unfolded. When the UFO abduction phenomenon flrst came to my attention, my curiosity was aroused, and I had a sense that something unusual was happening within me. But I had little notion of the extent to which my explorations would open my consciousness to vast mysteries and uncertainties. And I did not foresee how fundamentally challenged the view of the world in which I had been raised would be. Each of the thirteen people whose cases are described in this book-indeed each of the seventy-six abductees with whom I have worked-tells a unique story. The injdividual differences can probably be accounted for on the basis of the diverse personalities of the experiencers and the varieties of circumstances within the abductions themselves. But what I have found to be so extraordinary from the beginning of my study has been the readily identifiable patterns that emerge when the case narratives are examined carefully. It may be argued that it is my own mind that has created this coherence, and that I have shaped and interpreted data in line with a structure that I already have in mind. In response to this criticism, I can only state that the abduction phenomenon was, in the beginning, as unbelievable to me as it is to any skeptic and that I have tried to be aware of any inclination to form new beliefs and convictions that might take the place of previous ones that have been so radically \u00b7called into question. One of the reasons I chose to include so many cases in such great detail is my desire to weave a tapestry of sufficient richness to give readers the opportunity to make their own judgments about the abduction phenomenon. I cannot say that the cases selected have been \"typical,\" because I do not know what a typical case would be, or even that there is such a thing as a typical case. I do believe, however, that the cases I have discussed are illustrative of the range of phenomena that characterize abduction experiences. There are aspects of UFO abductions that do not obey the physical laws of the universe as we have known them. Some of the phenomena might be understood at some future time through great advances in physics. But others, such as the capacity abductees like Paul discover to move their consciousness through space and time, require another ontological paradigm. I do not expect that the material presented in this book will have much impact on the minds of those who believe that the laws of physics as encompassed by the Newtonian/Einsteinian system are the full definition of reality. I hope, however, that the data contained here is of sufficient power and solidity to enable those who are open to expanding their view of possible realities to consider that the world might contain forces and intelligences of which we have hardly allowed ourselves to dream. \"When I turn the lights out at night, this has been the show for the past week. I can see it with my eyes closed as well as open.\" -Anne (see page 403)  WAYS OF KNOWING: METHODOLOGY In physics, psychology, and other fields the data we obtain is a function of the way we have gone about the task of gaining information. In my own discipline of depth psychology, Freud and his followers, using their insights into the contents and structure of the human unconscious gained through the analysis of dreamsquite overlooked in the rationalist neuropsychology of his timederived the application of hypnosis in medical psychology and the method of free association. The development of new ways of knowing requires, however, something more than the application of different technologies or tools. Rather, an expanded epistemology, especially in psychology, may demand the legitimization (or relegitimization) of neglected aspects of ourselves as instruments of knowing. Although psychoanalysis has been responsible for great advances in our knowledge of human experience and the depths and structure of the psyche, it has retained as a way of knowing a good deal of the dualistic, subject/object split that characterizes Western empirical science, including psychology. The patient or client is generally regarded as someone with a problem, separate from the therapist/investigator; the patient is to be helped or studied. Indeed, Freud eventually turned away from hypnosis as a way of working with his patients in part because of the subjective bias it seemed to introduce into the therapeutic process (Mack 1993) rather than recognizing the inherent intersubjectivity of psychodynamic clinical work (Stolorow 1992) and continuing to struggle with the demand for analytic rigor that this requires. Alternative therapies and investigations of human consciousness appear to share an expanded use of the psyche as part of the exploratory process. The feelings and spirit of the facilitator in alternative therapeutic situations, as well as his or her rational mind and observational skills, are a vital aspect of the therapeutic or investigative method. This expanded use of the self relies on empathy and is, in essence, intersubjective. Within this framework hypnosis, shamanic journeys, meditation, Grof breathwork, vision quests, and other modalities, which are called in the West \"nonordinary\" states of consciousness, become natural investigative allies. For they involve, by definition, the opening of the psyche to the deeper realms that lie behind the rational or observing mind. In the end, of course, the rational intellect is essential for understanding and integrating the data obtained through the fuller use of consciousness as an investigative tool. But along the waywe-as investigators or readers-must open ourselves through this expanded way of knowing to whatever the patient or subject may report to be his or her experience. It is perhaps understandable, therefore, that I would have, in effect, \"stumbled\" upon the UFO abduction phenomenon and that I was then more or less prepared to take on its investigation in the context of my training in the Grof holotropic breathwork method (see chapter I ), which relies upon the use of the whole selfmind, body, and soul-in the exploration of unconscious human experience. In working with abductees, the investigative method I have developed is basically a combination of the old and the new. In addition to standard interviews I use hypnosis, which was Freud's original \"nonordinary\" state for investigating the unconscious, modified by the use of the breath for centering and deepening the process. In my work with abductees I am fully involved, experiencing and reliving with them the world that they are calling forth from their unconscious. My whole psyche or being is engaged; naturally the rational or observing self is always present, shaping, limiting, and protecting the process. The empirical methods of Western science rely primarily on the physical senses and rational intellect for gaining knowledge, and downplay feeling and intuition. They were developed in part to avoid the subjectivity, contaJ.llination, and sheer messiness of human emotion. Yet the cost of this restricted way of knowing may be that we now learn about the physical world with pnly limited use of our faculties. In order to learn about the worlds \"beyond the veil,\" as abductees put it, we may need a different kind of consciousness. This means that the process of gaining information about abductions is, to a large degree, participatory, even \"cocreative.\" By this I do not mean that I impose beliefs of my own about the phenomenon upon the experiencers, am leading or \"coaching\" them, or even that I believe literally everything an abductee says. As much as possible my questions in the sessions derive from what has just been said, or my intuition, based on experiences in therapy not only with abductees, but hundreds of patients, about where I feel the inner experience of the abductee is going. I avoid leading questions, and abductees, in my experience, are quite difficult to lead (they all seem to feel, as Sheila said, \"I know what I saw\"). Yet, at the same time, I cannot avoid the fact that a cocreative intuitive process such as this may yield information that is in some sense the product of the intermingling or flowing together of the consciousness of the two (or more) people in the room. Something may be brought forth that was not there before in exactly the same form. Stated differently, the information gained in the sessions is not simply a remembered \"item,\" lifted out of the experiencer's consciousness like a stone from a kidney. It may represent instead a developed or evolved perception, enriched by the connection that the experiencer and the investigator have made. From a traditional dualistic perspective this might be called \"distortion\"; from a transpersonal point of view the experiencer and I may be participating in an evolution of consciousness. When we are dealing with a phenomenon like alien abductions, which manifests in the physical world but may derive from some other reality, the question of whether hypnosis (or any other nonordinary modality that can help us access realities outside of or beyond the physical world) discloses accurately what literally or factually \"happened\" may be inappropriate (see Appendix A for a fuller discussion of this matter). A more useful question would be whether the investigative method can yield information that is consistent among experiencers, carries emotional conviction, and appears to enlarge our knowledge of phenomena that are significant for the lives of the experiencers and the larger culture."

        "text_target": "This is a very great time for humanity, but humanity is not prepared. From our vantage point, we can see this on a larger scale. We do not involve ourselves with the daily lives of individuals in the world. We do not attempt to persuade governments or to lay claim to certain parts of the world or to certain resources that exist here. Instead, we observe, and we wish to report what we observe, for this is our mission in being here. The Unseen Ones have told us that there are many people today who feel a strange discomfort, a sense of vague urgency, a feeling that something is going to happen and that something must be done. Perhaps there is nothing within their daily sphere of experience that justifies these deeper feelings, that verifies the importance of these feelings, or that gives substance to their expression. We can understand this because we have been through similar things ourselves in our own histories. We represent several races joined together in our small alliance to support the emergence of Knowledge and Wisdom in the universe, particularly with races that are on the threshold of emerging into the Greater Community. These emerging races are particularly vulnerable to foreign influence and manipulation. They are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding their situation and understandably so, for how could they comprehend the meaning and the complexity of life within the Greater Community? That is why we wish to play our small part in preparing and in educating humanity. In our first discourse, we gave a broad description of the visitors' involvement in four areas. The first area is the influence on important people in positions of power in governments and at the head of religious institutions. The second area of influence is on people who have a spiritual inclination and who wish to open themselves to the greater powers that exist in the universe. The third area of involvement is the visitors' building of establishments in the world in strategic locations, near population centers, where their influence on the mental environment can be exercised. And lastly, we spoke of their program of interbreeding with humanity, a program which has been underway for quite some time.",
        "text_source": "IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN IDENTITY Each abductee experiences in some sense an expansion of his or her sense of self, of identity in the world. Paul wondered how we had come to mistake the \"shell\" of our being for the \"whole\" of it; and Eva, in her recall of the Soul Bird story of her childhood, recognized there were compartments of self which she was opening up and merging in order to move from fragmentation toward wholeness. The change that abductees experience is fundamentally that they may no longer feel themselves to be separate from other beings. They shed their identification with a narrow social role and gain a sense of oneness with all creation, a kind of universal connectedness. This opening to a wider identity appears to be a direct result of the abduction experiences, if not a central aspect of the whole process. The change appears to be the result of two related elements. The abduction experiences themselves shatter the illusion of our control, and demonstrate forcefully \ufffdhat we are helpless in the face of forces and beings whose purpose we do not understand. Each abductee discovers that he or she is but one intelligent being in a universe populated with various other entities that are not \"supposed to\" exist. Human beings are not lords of the earth, they realize, but children of the cosmos who must find their way to live in harmony with all manner of creatures on the earth and elsewhere. This is a terrifying lesson in humility that opens the psyche to a wider perception of the universe, including the beings and entities that inhabit it. At the same time, as I noted, some abductees become open to the presence of a divine source, which fills their being and gives a sense of connection with a universal consciousness from which they have come and to which they will return. \"Past life\" experiences, which seem to extend the sense of self over time in both embodied and unembodied form, create a further expansion of the feeling of what it is to be a human being. Finally, the peculiar sense that many abductees gain during the relaxation sessions that they have a dual huf!lan/alien identity reinforces all of the above processes . For the alien self is felt to be a kind of missing part, a soul link to the universal source of consciousness, the anima mundi from which they feel they have been cut off.PoLITICAL, EcoNOMIC, AND RELIGious IMPLICATIONS The Western scientific/materialist worldview has been hugely successful in its explorations of the physical world, revealing many of its secrets and using this knowledge to serve human purposes. We have overcome the harshness of winter, reduced suffering through advances in medicine, and learned to communicate electronically with those who are far away. At the same time we have applied our knowledge to creating weapons of destruction that can now easily destroy life as we know it. Our use of modern technology to tear resources from the earth is bringing the biosphere to the brink of collapse. We are a species out of harmony with nature, gone berserk in the indulgence of its desires at the expense of other living beings and the earth that has given us life. The task of reversing this trend is momentous. Even as we recognize the peril we have created, the vested interests that stand in the way of discovering a balance in our relationship with nature are formidable. Huge \u00b7corporate, scientific, educational, and military institutions consume many billions of dollars of material goods and maintain, as if mindlessly, a paralyzing stasis that is difficult to reverse. For international business the world seems at times to be nothing more than a giant market to be divided up among the cleverest entrepreneurs."

It is a difficult task and a difficult message. We understand the problems that people may have in receiving this communication. They may question our method of communicating. They may question, certainly, our reality and identity and the trustworthiness of our words. They may question the reality that we are presenting. And perhaps the temptation to deny these things will be great for some people. Yet what will really enable you to hear our words and to know their authenticity will be your ability to respond with the deeper knowing within yourself. Throughout our discourses, we have referred to the reality of Knowledge, the Spiritual Intelligence that lives within you. We have spoken of its central importance in your preparation for the Greater Community. We have spoken of it as the true power that enables you to see beyond all the deceptions and manipulations of the Intervention. we have spoken of it as the inherent power that the Collectives do not use and do not recognize-Knowledge. This Knowledge is not like a military power. It is not something that you can use to gain things by force or to overwhelm or dominate others. It is the greater Spiritual Intelligence that you share with the Creator. Humanity has a great challenge before it and is facing a great risk in its emergence into the Greater Community. Therefore, it is necessary to find the strength that will enable you to unite your peoples and to take your place in the Greater Community as a free and self-determined race. This power must come from within people and must be reinforced by the greater forces for good that exist both within your world and in the Greater Community. There will perhaps be people who will reject our words and counsel and reject what we are presenting altogether. They may have their own preferences in the matter. They may have their own fear and sense of inadequacy. Perhaps they have fallen prey already to the persuasions of the Intervention and do not wish to consider that they may be in error. Perhaps they are just too afraid to face this great challenge. Perhaps they want to escape into their personal concerns and preoccupations. But what is really being called for here is the power and the presence of this Spiritual Intelligence we call Knowledge, which is the source of your real conscience. Yet what you may not realize is that this is the very source and bond of all spirituality in the universe. The expressions of spirituality and the rituals of spirituality, the great Teachers and emissaries of spirituality are too numerous to count in the universe. The philosophies and the methodologies are unique to cultures and their histories. But at the center is this mysterious and profound power that enables you to see, to know and to act in harmony with the Creator of all life. Surely our presence and our words can be rejected and denied. But with Knowledge, this will not be the case. For we are certain that we are presenting the truth to the best of our ability. Your allies abroad have sent us here on a mission in great service to humanity. The integrity of our mission and of our presentation is real and genuine. It is not merely a matter of perspective or perception. We must rely upon this Spiritual Power within you, the reader and the receiver of our message. For indeed, we are revealing more than our words can convey. We are revealing an entire reality of life in the universe. We are opening the door to the great mysteries that humanity has not yet penetrated, and in some cases has not even considered. Though we are very different from you and though we practice our spirituality in ways that are unique to us and that you could not really accommodate, what we emphasize is absolutely fundamental to your being, to your nature and to your reality.",

In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

        "text_target": "Surely you can imagine how this could be the case. Even within your own world according to your history, you have seen smaller nations fall under the domination of greater ones. You can see this even today. Therefore, these ideas are not wholly foreign to you. In the Greater Community, as in your world, the strong will dominate the weak, if they can. This is a reality of life everywhere. And it is for this reason that we are encouraging your awareness and your preparation, in order that you may become strong and your self-determination may grow. It may be a grave disappointment to many to understand and to learn that freedom is rare in the universe. As nations become stronger and more technological, they require greater and greater uniformity and compliance amongst their peoples. As they bridge out into the Greater Community and become involved in Greater Community affairs, the tolerance for individual expression diminishes to the point where large nations that have wealth and power are governed with a strictness and an exacting attitude that you would find abhorrent. Here you must learn that technological advancement and spiritual advancement are not the same, a lesson that humanity has yet to learn and which you must learn if you are to exercise your natural wisdom in these matters. Your world is greatly valued. It is rich biologically. You are sitting on a prize that you must protect if you are to be its stewards and its beneficiaries. Consider the peoples in your world who have lost their freedom because they lived in a place considered valuable by others. It is now the whole human family that is so imperiled. ~  Because the visitors are so skilled in projecting thoughts and influencing people's mental environment, how do we ensure ourselves that what we are seeing is real? The only basis for wise perception is the cultivation of Knowledge. If you believe only what you see, then you will believe only what is shown to you. There are many, we are told, that have this perspective. Yet we have learned that the wise everywhere must gain a greater vision and a greater discernment. It is true that your visitors can project images of your saints and of your religious figures. Though this is not practiced often, it certainly can be used in order to evoke commitment and dedication amongst those who are already given to such beliefs. Here your spirituality becomes an area of vulnerability where wisdom must be used. Yet the Creator has given you Knowledge as a foundation for true discernment. You can know what you are seeing if you ask yourself if it is real. Yet to do this, you must have this foundation, and that is why the teaching in The Way of Knowledge is so fundamental to learning Greater Community Spirituality. Without this, people will believe what they want to believe, and they will rely upon what they see and what they are shown. And their potential for freedom will have been lost already, for it was never allowed to flourish in the first place.",
        "text_source": "Seth claimed to have consciously entered our three-dimensional reality to educate humans to their inherent potential. You are, truly multidimensional personalities, he explained through Roberts. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously. Your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts-and the facts are difficult to explain. . . . Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion. Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets. . . . According to Seth, The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads on a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the one source. Seth offered this analogy to explain why humans seem to have blocked any remembrance of their multidimensional selves from memory: A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget that wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day-or for a year or five years-he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched. He said scientists are only just now learning what some philosophers have espoused for centuries-that the mind can influence matter. Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matters that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self. You have lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. You may think of your soul or entity . . . as some conscious and living, divinely-inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself. The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world's misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively. Seth said some UFO sightings are instances where human and nonhuman thought projections touch and represent only our perceptions of visitors from other realities. What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities, he explained. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring."

        "text_target": "Then there are Collectives, who are multi-racial, hierarchical and very well organized. Their worker classes are bred for specific purposes, and they are involved in collective breeding, which is a practice not all advanced races are engaged in. The Collectives seek a more permanent residence in this world. They seek it as a world that either they or their clients could own and govern from afar, with human assistance. That is why such great care has been taken to study human psychology, human physiology and your reproductive process, as well as the biological hazards that exist on Earth. That is one of the reasons that plant samples have been taken and the world has been observed for such a very long time. It is perhaps surprising for you to realize that an advanced technological race would have difficulty adapting to your world, believing that their science and medical technology would have overcome the difficulties involved here. But, alas, so great are these difficulties that there is no race who has evolved in sterile or near sterile environments that could easily withstand the biological agents that exist here. Even the illnesses of your animals could affect them. So great is this hazard that in recent history few races have attempted colonization of this world. But now the Collectives see an advantage, for humanity has built networks that they can use-worldwide communications, worldwide resource extraction and a sufficient level of technology that can, at a basic level, interface with what they use and rely upon. Humanity is also developing greater sources of destructive power, and should this power be fully cultivated, then interventions such as this kind would be more difficult to attempt. Lastly, there is the deterioration of your natural environment, which is threatening many of the very resources that the Intervention seeks. That is why the Intervention has gone into its mature phase in the last half century, an accelerated phase involving four fundamental activities: the attempt to persuade certain individuals in positions of power in government, commerce and religion; to establish a physical presence and familiarity within the world itself; to influence religious views and tendencies, which also includes the promotion of human conflict; and the program of hybridization to establish adapted beings in a human form who are allegiant to the Intervention and who can assume greater governing powers here in the world. These four interrelated programs represent the activities of the Collectives. Resource explorers operate in a more simple manner, by taking things they need from the world, as they are able to find them. But the Collectives have a more complex and long-range plan in establishing power and influence within this world. They recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the human family and your tendency towards conflict. They recognize that to gain human allegiance, which is their goal, they must present themselves as capable of assisting and even saving humanity from its own problems and from the great challenges that it now faces. The Intervention will present itself, therefore, in a more enlightened form-as spiritual agents, as those who have overcome war and conflict, who live in peace and who have achieved technology that humanity can now use and, indeed, now needs in order to rescue its environment and to bring a cessation of conflict in the world. Yet this all represents deception, for the Collectives actually seek to increase human conflict, to weaken the strongest worldly powers and to gain allegiance through human failure-allegiance and a reliance upon their presence. Their interbreeding program is not only to establish individuals in positions of power, but also to condition and to program those that they take to become the Intervention's representatives and apologists-those who will promote the Intervention and the peoples of the world having direct access to these intervening powers, bypassing their governments, bypassing human authority figures, in order to establish direct contact with those forces who are conditioning people to believe that the Intervention is here on their behalf. It is a clever approach and well conceived, and so far it is progressing with very little human resistance. Even the governments of the world have been seduced in many ways. They have made contracts with the Intervention which the Intervention has violated, and now there are those within the governments of the world who are aware of the Intervention and who support it, and there are those who are aware of it and who oppose it. So the seeds of conflict and opposition have even been sown within the corridors of power within your nations' governments, many of them. The Intervention is being carried out by physical beings who are driven by the same needs that drive humanity-the need for resources, the need for power, the need for wealth and the need for strategic advantage. It is these very things that drive all nations in the universe. You must not regard these beings as evil or demonic or as angelic. They are beings driven by the same needs that drive humanity. It is important now that we address the question of how the Intervention is functioning within the context of the three primary requirements that humanity must meet and must utilize in order to become a free race in the universe. The Intervention does not value freedom. It is unknown amongst its participants. It will, therefore, seek to oppose or undermine any progress that humanity will attempt to make regarding these three fundamental requirements. Human unity will be opposed because a united human family will be very difficult to influence. Human conflict can be so easily antagonized, increased and directed. The Intervention does not want to see humanity unite in facing the Greater Community. Therefore, human conflict will be encouraged, particularly by those hybridized individuals who have assumed positions in advising human leaders. It is their advising roles that have the most influence here. These are not individuals that you will see, for they are not public. They are hidden and well placed. However, they have their opponents within governments. For there is a struggle going on within the secret corridors of government, and that is why the Intervention has sought to influence commercial powers even more than government officials. For commercial powers are governed by greed. They seek wealth, power, predominance and advantage over their rivals. They do not have public scrutiny and are not accountable to people at large, and so they are much more likely candidates for the plan of the Intervention to gain human representatives and human liaisons. Human unity will be opposed by the Intervention, for a united humanity will oppose intervention. It will become increasingly resistant to any attempt by any foreign power to gain access or advantage here. That is why the emphasis for the Intervention is to amplify human crises, human conflicts, human disagreements and to encourage the proliferation of weapons, to lead humanity further in its own self-determined path of destruction. A weakened humanity will be vulnerable to persuasion, and a weakened humanity will be more likely to respond to offers of technology, to offers of assistance in governance and to offers of becoming connected to trade networks that already exist in the universe. If humanity declines, it will be hard for either your leaders or your peoples to turn down offers of technology and resources that will be provided for you-offers that will surely undermine your self-determination and make you dependent upon networks of trade, commerce and power over which you will have no influence or control.",

'In your case,' continued the voice, 'the exposure was so short and over such a small area that you are not in any great danger, although you will probably feel some effects sooner or later, provided, of course, that your biological functions are similar to ours, and we have good reason to believe they are.' The voice continued:  As to your second question, I am not an American such as you, nor even an 'Earthian', although my present assignment requires me to become both. The fact that you believed me to be one of your countrymen is a testimonial to the effort I have expended to learn and to practise your language. If you talked with me for any length of time, however, you would begin to notice that my vocabulary is far from complete, and many of my words would seem outdated and perhaps obsolete. As a matter of fact, I have never yet set foot upon your planet. It will require at least four more of your years for me to become adapted to your environment, including your stronger gravity, [and] your atmosphere ... I will also require the complete cooperation of someone like yourself who is already a resident of the planet. Fry stood silently for what seemed a long time, attempting to come to terms with the profound implications of what he had seen and heard. The conversation then continued, with Fry asking a variety of questions, the first dealing with his reactions to the experience. The voice was encouraging:  One of the purposes of this visit is to determine the basic adaptability of the Earth's peoples, particularly your ability to adjust your minds quickly to conditions and concepts completely foreign to your customary modes of thought. Previous expeditions by our ancestors, over a period of many centuries, met with almost total failure in this respect. This time there is hope that we may find minds somewhat more receptive so that we may assist you in the progress, or at least in the continued existence of your race . The fact that, in spite of being in circumstances completely unique in your experience, you are listening calmly to my voice and making logical replies is the best evidence that your mind is of the type we hoped to find. Fry thanked the voice, but pointed out that this statement implied that he was to be used in some project involving the advancement of the people of Earth. 'Why me?' he asked. 'Is it just because I accidentally happened to be here when you landed? I could easily put you in touch with a number of men right here at the test base who could be of far more value to you than I.'"

It is not simply that they want you to be a work force for them; they want you to become a part of them. This adds to their collective strength and will minimize any resistance in the future that humanity might mount for its own sake. This is why there is such a great investment of time and energy in gaining human allegiance, in bonding with humanity through interbreeding and in establishing a deep and pervasive association with the human family. This world is so valuable that the Intervention does not want to risk a human revolution in the future. Such revolutions have happened before. We can attest to this from our own experience. We are the product of such revolutions in our own worlds. Though our circumstances were quite different from yours, the nature of the Intervention and the methods employed were actually quite similar. This is why we can speak with authority on this subject. The inducements that will be brought to bear will be varied, depending on who is being reached and for what purpose. For individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative in the halls of government, the inducement will be the promise of greater power and technology. Humanity is in a very vulnerable position in this sense because its belief in technology and its hope that technology will solve all of its problems are very, very strong. This of course has been supported by the Intervention because this is one of the primary avenues in which humanity will likely become dependent on the Intervention itself. To those in the corridors of power in your governments, those individuals who are deemed receptive and cooperative, the promise of greater technology and even world dominion will be presented. This can be presented either through the Mental Environment as ideas sent into the minds of these individuals, or, as has already occurred, there may be face-to-face encounters with the visitors themselves.",
        "text_source": "Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear."

The human family, without even knowing it, is part of a Greater Coordination. It is something only the Wise can fully understand. And even here their comprehension of this great Network must remain incomplete. For what individual can know of a Network so vast, so complicated and coordinated from Higher and Greater Powers, subject to so many circumstances and changing conditions that it is beyond the capacity of any individual, or even group, to fully realize? But to know you are part of this Coordination, to carry out your duties as part of this Coordination, that is the mountain you must climb to learn of these things sufficiently. We speak of things now in service to the Revelation that is being given to the world, and its teaching about life in the universe in particular. For you must have testimony from the universe itself, and not from one race or individual alone, but from a greater Network representing countless races that function beyond the reach of governments and commerce; beyond the reach of ambitious individuals and groups and nations; beyond all of the corruption and manipulation that exist in this region of space, which is considerable and complicated and dangerous. We bring to you the reality of life in the universe as we see it and have known it. It is not simply our understanding, however, that we present to you here. It is the wisdom of the Networks of the Wise, who share their wisdom with one another through the Higher Powers. In this way, Heaven has its agents on the ground-here, there, everywhere, hidden, small groups and sometimes isolated individuals, but very well connected so that the wisdom that we provide can not only represent our individual experience or understanding, but the wisdom of the Wise throughout this part of the universe. There is no race that could understand the meaning of life fully in this universe, or understand fully that all beings living in the physical reality are living in a state of Separation from the Divine. The Revelation for your world now, and the Messenger sent for this purpose, can explain these things to you, for you need a human representative to do this for you. He too is part of the Greater Coordination, as is his family. They have been sent here as the seeds of the Greater Coordination in the world, not only to meet the great challenge of Intervention and the great challenges that humanity is facing, but also to accompany humanity's emergence into the Greater Community and to build this sacred bond here. For if humanity is to ever attain real freedom in the universe, or be able to maintain this freedom and to attain stability in this world with your environment, you will need this Greater Coordination here to maintain a higher level of Knowledge and, if possible, even to advise your future leaders.

For those in political power are rarely involved in the great Networks because they are too heavily controlled and influenced by their governments.",
        "text_source": "Still, there is cause for believing that some Nazi technology during the war was of a genuine proto-UFO nature. There is even good reason to consider that, somewhere, someone was trying to build genuine flying saucers in the immediate aftermath of the war. But it must be emphasized that the evidence for this is slender, and based on a surprisingly small number of claims. Nor has it ever been answered satisfactorily where they were based, who built them, what their missions were, or what relation (if any) they had with pre-war sightings of apparent UFOs. And again, most important is the lack of any historical documentation leading us to a firm conclusion. One scenario that has often been raised is that the Nazis set up a base in Antarctica (Neu-Schwabenland) which became a major problem after the war's end, as it contained all their advanced science and weaponry. This in turn underlies the claim that the American expedition known as Operation Highjump, which took place in late 1946 and early 1947, was in reality a failed military expedition against the secret Nazi base. Highjump was indeed a large expedition, including 13 ships and nearly 5,000 men, and as recent scholarship has shown, it was designed to train the U.S. Navy for a possible war with the Soviet Union in the Arctic, and not to attack an alleged German base in Antarctica. The Operation did end earlier than scheduled, and there were also deaths, but all of the problems appear explainable by bad weather, which became quite serious by February 1947. The Commander of Highjump, Admiral Richard Byrd, gave a statement to the March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper, El Mercurio. This is sometimes used to indicate that Byrd was hinting at the reality of dangerous, revolutionary, technology in Antarctica. In fact, his statement does not appear to do this. The article, in part, reads as follows:  Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking-recalled the admiral-is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety. Unless one decides to speculate that Byrd was speaking in code, there is no justification for interpreting his statement any other way than how it was reported, barring new facts or developments. Moreover, if Highjump ended in disaster, why then were subsequent, smaller expeditions sent to the same region later in 1947 and 1948? Such was Operation Windmill, described as an exploration and training mission in 1947-1948. In addition, the private explorer Finn Rone organized an expedition to the same area at this time. In other words, the idea of a Nazi base in Antarctica has no foundation, only speculation. So the Nazi-UFO connection, just like the ET-UFO connection, offers its own frustrations and dead-ends. And yet, we can at least acknowledge the genuine possibility that there was a connection, and that the Americans, British, Russians, and others were very interested in such Nazi technology. As Cook, Farrell and others have pointed out, it has always been suspected that Hans Kammler, who disappeared at the end of the war, went to work for the Americans. Moreover, there can be no question that a clandestine flying saucer program would have been desirable within the U.S. and possibly elsewhere in the immediate post-war era. This would presumably include science related not only to acquired technology-whether from Nazis or extraterrestrials-but also to the pioneering research of people like Nikola Tesla and Townsend Brown (both discussed in Chapter Eleven). The question is not was there a terrestrial effort to build flying saucers. Rather, whether or not this scientific work comprised the sum total of what we call the UFO phenomenon. That is, are UFOs a completely man-made phenomenon, and is the alien connection merely disinformation and a distraction? For those researchers who believe this, the reasoning is (a) that aliens from another planet, arriving in flying saucers that look like human designs from the 1940s, is implausible; (b) human science and technology is more than sufficient to explain the operation of UFOs, as long as we include hidden, suppressed technologies; and (c) the alien connection is pure disinformation designed to confuse the public from the reality of a fully terrestrial breakaway civilization that has no intention of sharing its technology with the masses. As I have been suggesting, and will continue to argue in this book, there is a certain logic to the position, but only if a substantial body of other evidence is ignored. Moreover, there is more evidence that the core UFO phenomenon derives from others not from our civilization. The Requirements of Secrecy   Let us return to 1947, to President Harry Truman, facing the shattering news that other beings of some sort were here. Moreover, that the U.S. military had recovered some of their technology, and even bodies. We may assume that this would require the creation of black budgets. After all, it would be necessary to fund these programs, and it would not exactly be the wisest idea to inform Congress about it, considering that so little would be known about these beings, considering the desire to keep such technology away from enemies real or perceived, and for so many other reasons already discussed. Thus, layer upon layer of secrecy would need to be established to hide these UFO-extraterrestrial technology programs. As we know has become the norm within the black budget world, such a program would be nested within other classified programs, providing deep layers of protection from outside observation. Such a program of secret study would also require ongoing influence and even control over mainstream radio, newspapers, and television. This does not mean that the CIA would control every piece of information coming through the media. It might mean, however, that there would be key, strategically placed, individuals who would influence stories as they came out. In other words, spin control: promoting certain types of stories and killing others. Over the years, there have been a number of expos\u00e9s detailing the relationship between the CIA and the news media. One was from 1977 by journalist Carl Bernstein, of Watergate fame. Bernstein concluded that since the end of the Second World War, the CIA had recruited more than four hundred U.S. journalists and placed them secretly on its payroll. [165] Any private citizen might well ask what he or she could accomplish with four hundred journalists, many in highly influential positions, as secret employees? Certainly there would be a great ability to influence the news, and therefore influence public opinion. The same situation applies to the academic and scientific communities, as well as to Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Influencing them is easier than most people realize. With a few leading professors at the right institutions-Harvard, Princeton, UCLA, Berkeley, University of Chicago-the guard dogs would be in place. A young professor who develops an interest in UFOs would then be smacked down by the leading lights. In fact, this is known to have happened. Harvard astronomer Donald Menzel fulfilled precisely this role during the 1950s and 1960s. Not only was he the leading debunker of UFOs in the world during that period of time, but he had a secret relationship with the National Security Agency. Not even his wife knew about that. In today's world, such relationships are sometimes barely even concealed, as if no one cares. There is a virtual revolving door between the government/intelligence community and the most prestigious elements of the academic world. The situation is even worse in the world of scientific research, where everything is controlled by funding, and the largest share of funding for the scientific community comes from the U.S. government. Scientists who stray into areas not approved by their paymasters quickly find that they lose their funding, after which a loss of standing and prestige are a constant threat. These are very big incentives to toe the line. Thus, control moves beyond the classified world to become cultural. The Breakaway Civilization   What happens when teams of brilliant scientists, under conditions of total secrecy, and utilizing limitless black budget money, are able to study recovered extraterrestrial technology for many years, and even decades?"

It is part of the way the Divine works in the universe to foster wisdom, freedom and Knowledge wherever that is possible and to whatever extent it is possible. We can only pray, in the way that we pray, that this great Revelation may meet and reach enough people in your world to have its full benefit and impact. This fulfills our task, which is to speak of these things that we speak of and to bring you Wisdom and Knowledge from the universe that we have had to learn through great trial and great necessity. We understand this will be very confusing to many people, all these things we speak of here now. And we did not speak of the Revelation from God before because we felt it would be too much for people to try to comprehend, along with everything we are charged with expressing, the wisdom we are charged to give to you. But now that we are far away, we can speak of other matters. It is necessary that we be a witness to this, to this Revelation from the Divine that you are so fortunate to have in your midst. If only you could see how fortunate you are, given what freedom you have today, which has been the product of so much human giving and sacrifice already. If you could understand how rare an event this is, your gratitude would be overflowing, and you would understand its great importance. We must again speak of the reality of freedom from where we stand and what we know, for we are asked to bear witness to these things from our experience, not merely from our ideology or the way that we think of these things. We know that freedom is not a right in the universe. It is a rare and precious thing. It must be established and secured with the greatest determination. We have earned the freedom to serve in this way, to be able to serve another race in this way-in a way that the people of your world can hear, that it can be made available as testimony. How rare this is indeed. We have been assisted in this way once we were able to secure our freedom in our nations, for the Greater Powers have been able to serve us directly. For the development of freedom and the stability of freedom is an ongoing challenge that requires great maturity, wisdom and restraint. Though we are not enlightened societies as you would think of them perhaps, we are free enough to have this opportunity and to be served in this way. But humanity does not yet have this freedom, even at present, for a new Revelation for your world will be greatly resisted and contested.

        "text_source": "Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people from around the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs and philosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generational divides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as to priorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized many people around the world into permanent suspicion against global political elites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is our technology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply getting access to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced. Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filed online every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance are hundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there are thousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered and overwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incredible field. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history of UFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspect of the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Trying to make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone's pet project for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has been heating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are on the brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

It is a difficult task and a difficult message. We understand the problems that people may have in receiving this communication. They may question our method of communicating. They may question, certainly, our reality and identity and the trustworthiness of our words. They may question the reality that we are presenting. And perhaps the temptation to deny these things will be great for some people. Yet what will really enable you to hear our words and to know their authenticity will be your ability to respond with the deeper knowing within yourself. Throughout our discourses, we have referred to the reality of Knowledge, the Spiritual Intelligence that lives within you. We have spoken of its central importance in your preparation for the Greater Community. We have spoken of it as the true power that enables you to see beyond all the deceptions and manipulations of the Intervention. we have spoken of it as the inherent power that the Collectives do not use and do not recognize-Knowledge. This Knowledge is not like a military power. It is not something that you can use to gain things by force or to overwhelm or dominate others. It is the greater Spiritual Intelligence that you share with the Creator. Humanity has a great challenge before it and is facing a great risk in its emergence into the Greater Community. Therefore, it is necessary to find the strength that will enable you to unite your peoples and to take your place in the Greater Community as a free and self-determined race. This power must come from within people and must be reinforced by the greater forces for good that exist both within your world and in the Greater Community. There will perhaps be people who will reject our words and counsel and reject what we are presenting altogether. They may have their own preferences in the matter. They may have their own fear and sense of inadequacy. Perhaps they have fallen prey already to the persuasions of the Intervention and do not wish to consider that they may be in error. Perhaps they are just too afraid to face this great challenge. Perhaps they want to escape into their personal concerns and preoccupations. But what is really being called for here is the power and the presence of this Spiritual Intelligence we call Knowledge, which is the source of your real conscience. Yet what you may not realize is that this is the very source and bond of all spirituality in the universe. The expressions of spirituality and the rituals of spirituality, the great Teachers and emissaries of spirituality are too numerous to count in the universe.

        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

It is a difficult task and a difficult message. We understand the problems that people may have in receiving this communication. They may question our method of communicating. They may question, certainly, our reality and identity and the trustworthiness of our words. They may question the reality that we are presenting. And perhaps the temptation to deny these things will be great for some people. Yet what will really enable you to hear our words and to know their authenticity will be your ability to respond with the deeper knowing within yourself. Throughout our discourses, we have referred to the reality of Knowledge, the Spiritual Intelligence that lives within you. We have spoken of its central importance in your preparation for the Greater Community. We have spoken of it as the true power that enables you to see beyond all the deceptions and manipulations of the Intervention. we have spoken of it as the inherent power that the Collectives do not use and do not recognize-Knowledge. This Knowledge is not like a military power. It is not something that you can use to gain things by force or to overwhelm or dominate others. It is the greater Spiritual Intelligence that you share with the Creator. Humanity has a great challenge before it and is facing a great risk in its emergence into the Greater Community. Therefore, it is necessary to find the strength that will enable you to unite your peoples and to take your place in the Greater Community as a free and self-determined race. This power must come from within people and must be reinforced by the greater forces for good that exist both within your world and in the Greater Community. There will perhaps be people who will reject our words and counsel and reject what we are presenting altogether. They may have their own preferences in the matter. They may have their own fear and sense of inadequacy. Perhaps they have fallen prey already to the persuasions of the Intervention and do not wish to consider that they may be in error. Perhaps they are just too afraid to face this great challenge. Perhaps they want to escape into their personal concerns and preoccupations. But what is really being called for here is the power and the presence of this Spiritual Intelligence we call Knowledge, which is the source of your real conscience. Yet what you may not realize is that this is the very source and bond of all spirituality in the universe. The expressions of spirituality and the rituals of spirituality, the great Teachers and emissaries of spirituality are too numerous to count in the universe. The philosophies and the methodologies are unique to cultures and their histories. But at the center is this mysterious and profound power that enables you to see, to know and to act in harmony with the Creator of all life. Surely our presence and our words can be rejected and denied. But with Knowledge, this will not be the case. For we are certain that we are presenting the truth to the best of our ability.

        "text_source": "Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people from around the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs and philosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generational divides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as to priorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized many people around the world into permanent suspicion against global political elites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is our technology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply getting access to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced. Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filed online every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance are hundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there are thousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered and overwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incredible field. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of the UFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history of UFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspect of the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Trying to make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone's pet project for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has been heating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are on the brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There are important political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government and military/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzing this, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that its members may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appears that at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed to them. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information about UFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics. A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national security apparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide the UFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditional republican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics. The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, including how ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from true UFOs. Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when information practically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact from fiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extent that these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travel be possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mind communication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can a study of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of our reality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whatever they are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history and claims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, and perhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great deal of information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some of these beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we ought to try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topic in the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true Disclosure of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one that includes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world. Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be careful in forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demands our attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same as today. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefs of what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether by design, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so many amazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should not expect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studied history for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When I initially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might be able to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there was anything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I have spent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released its grip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and my place in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill or blue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventional world, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simple red pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regular basis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize something new, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon we notice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further. And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years ago with one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wanted to know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. national security community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However, that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all the answers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason for despair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey is the reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me."

        "text_target": "At the outset, they will treat you with deference, those of you who may encounter them face to face, but they will give you no power. They will not give you a choice. They will only try to convince you of the wisdom of their ways and the necessity of their presence in the world. And should you decline or should you resist, they will make life difficult for you, or they will discard you for later use. Some of those, we understand, who have not returned to the world were those who fought against them and were eliminated as a result. How do we know these things? We know them because we understand the Collectives. We understand their legal commerce, and we understand their illegal commerce. They want to use every part of the world. And they want to use every part of you. Just like you would want to use every part of the cow or the sheep or any other domesticated animal that you breed for your own purposes. How do we know that they are doing these things in the world? We know because we are monitoring their communications. Otherwise, we could not fully observe their activities and understand the nature of their involvement here. It is remarkably similar to their involvement in other emerging worlds. What we cannot see, the Unseen Ones have revealed to us. We know from their transmissions, their communications with their bases within the world and their satellites beyond the world, that many of their specimens, as they refer to you, have either perished or had to be used for other reasons. However, we know from their earth transmissions that many people are disappearing. So it is not difficult for us to see the connection. In their attempt to breed a new leadership for humanity, a hybridized person, they need all of these biological resources that we are describing. What we are speaking of here is the most hidden and secret part of their agenda, the part that they will never reveal to you willingly, the part that you may never see without great assistance. This is the most secret of their activities. They sell biological products on what you would call a black market in the universe. But the value of these products and the demand for them is indeed significant. In most places where commerce has been established, such as in your vicinity, such trade is illegal, for it is considered to be morally and ethically reprehensible. But with so many technological societies existing in the universe and biological resources such as exist in your world being as rare as they are, the demand for these fundamental elements is considerable. Many technologically advancing nations have outstripped their own world's biological resources to the extent that they must find them elsewhere, and they must trade and barter for them as one of their primary endeavors. This is not simply food products, minerals and metals and elements such as this. It is also the need for biological products such as we have described, which are abundant in your world and which are abundant within the human family. So when someone asks, What do they want? The appropriate answer is, They want your world and its resources. And they want you and your resources. As we have said, this is the most hidden of their agendas. But it is necessary for you to know because this makes the violation complete. The visitors do not hate humanity. They are not cruel and murderous in the sense that you might think. They just view you as a resource the way you view your animals as a resource. To them, though you have intelligence, they consider that you are irredeemably chaotic and unruly, and they do not understand your deeper motivations. They see your technology as being in a rather adolescent phase, and they look at your destructive behaviors with concern, anxiety and repulsion. Being without Knowledge, the spiritual foundation, they do not see that what they are perpetrating upon your world is ethically or morally reprehensible. It is merely an opportunity to fulfill their practical necessities  As we have said, they seek to bring humanity into their Collective, but this is only a very select part of your population. And here you would not be at the upper levels of their hierarchy. For all the other people in the world, what will happen to them if the Intervention is complete, if the occupation can be established completely? We have been reluctant to tell you certain things because we do not want to lose your attention. We do not want you to turn away in denial, thinking that you cannot face these matters. So we have tried to be extremely careful in the way that we have presented the situation. But in spite of this, there are certain things you must know and that you cannot readily see from your vantage point. We had to learn about these realities ourselves though we had assistance such as we are providing for you. But the reprehensible nature of the Collectives and their lack of morality and ethics is something we have had to face. That is why we avoid the Collectives in our own worlds, where they cannot penetrate. There are many nations in the universe that have created alliances to protect themselves from Collectives such as these, particularly in well-inhabited areas of the galaxy. This is why many of the Collectives' activities are governed by trade unions and regional governing powers and authorities. They are held in check by many other forces who do not want to fall under their persuasion or their control. Even many of their trading partners look at them with anxiety. And even if they are forced to engage in commerce with Collectives, they must protect themselves from the Collectives' influence. Resources are precious in the universe-mineral resources, water resources, biological resources, food resources. Large technological societies such as the Collectives have an enormous need for resources for their own maintenance. Their commerce is based upon the acquisition of all these things and on the exploration for new sources. This, of course, makes them primarily interested in emerging worlds such as your own, which are emerging within regions where they have influence and power. Consider our words. Now we will tell you what you must do.",
        "text_source": "As far as the public knows at this time, we have not been able to visit places outside our solar system, though we have some good ideas about how that may be accomplished, if we were able to commit the huge resources to explore our local neighborhood, and then outside our solar system. But craft are coming here in fairly large numbers, apparently operated by humanoid beings who must have been building vehicles for deep-space travel for some time. Our nibbling at advanced technology has been recent compared to the age of the neighborhood. (Think of such recent topics as genetics, nuclear energy, microwaves, space travel, nanotechnology, the Internet, cell phones, and advanced computers.) In addition to the visitors' advanced technology, it appears they must have at least some advanced sociology as well: They haven't caused wholesale destruction on our planet.. .yet. They don't knock down every aircraft that gets a radar lock on them and comes chasing them. As far as we know, they haven't given ultimatums to earthling governments to do certain things-or else. We haven't been told to throw out our religions, or to destroy certain groups because the aliens don't approve of them. As far as can be told, they haven't offered new and better weapons to this or that group to help them with this or that project. They haven't enslaved us. They don't seem to have intervened in any large way. That would seem to show forbearance. I must say, the fact that they are being observed all over the planet does spread the message that we are neither alone nor the bigshots in the neighborhood-a big message indeed. When one looks at government budgets, we surely spend a lot on the tools of warfare. The defense budget of the United States is more than half a trillion dollars for 2008. The rest of the world will spend at least that much on the military. I should think it would seem strange to the visitors that 30,000 children will die every day of preventable disease and starvation, and that we apparently can't afford to spend enough money to make a dent in that tragic statistic. We know we are fouling our waterways and the skies above, but we certainly don't seem to be able to get together with others on the planet to solve what are planetary (rather than national) problems. Certainly, despite all the jokes about aliens landing and saying, \"Take me to your leader,\" we know there is no leader of the planet to whom to be taken. Considering that any alien star-faring civilization must be considerably older than our solar system-bound one, one must ask, what do they know about the real history of our planet? Were we originally colonized by space travelers? Are they the real \"gods\" from above of whom our ancestors seemed to be aware? Have there been large-scale disasters such as global warming, nuclear wars, and asteroid impacts elsewhere? Do they know more about what is in store for us, if we follow this or that sociological or technological path, than we do? Are they aware of much better means for producing electricity and transportation systems than our current technologies? Do they know better ways of diagnosing and treating diseases? What do they think, (and, more importantly, what will they do) about the population increase taking place in countries that can't provide food and health for the populations they already have? What does it say about our supposedly democratic governments on this planet that they have been unwilling to tell the public the truth about alien visitors? Shouldn't we know the philosophy of our potential elected officials when it comes to dealing with alien visitors? Have they sold us out? Made deals about which we know nothing for personal gain or power? The press treatment in 2007 of the UFO sighting by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was hardly the essence of respectable journalism. How much have our leaders been told, if anything, about what happens to societies such as ours that have developed weapons of mass destruction, but without providing for practical answers to our real problems of climate change, starvation, disease, plagues, and terrorism? I realize this sounds like a shopping list of topics for a sociology course. But one of the major terms in the Drake equation is the life span of a society. Are there societies that have lasted for millions of years as opposed to hundreds or thousands? How have they solved these problems? I am sometimes asked if I really think our society can handle the truth about alien visitations. If the truth were told, would there be rioting in the streets? Based on the responses to my lectures, I would say most people can handle it. It may well depend on how the message was presented; I have some suggestions regarding that. First, I think that announcements should be made by many governments at once, along with announcements that there will be international conferences on the religious, political, and economic implications of our not being alone, and not being the most advanced society in the neighborhood. If we found out an asteroid was heading toward us, would we not all need a way to avoid such a catastrophe? Surely we wouldn't say, that's not my problem, let us just continue on our way. Just as in most sporting matches there are time-outs during which the action stops, isn't there a need for a time-out for our primitive, warlike society to step back and not say, \"Tell us all that scientists have learned about alien technology,\" but rather, \"What can we do to help our own society make a better world?\" We all know, though we try to avoid thinking about it, that there is no way that the people in poor nations can possibly use as much energy and resources per person as do those in rich nations. How long will the poor continue to put up with the despoiling of the planet for the benefit of the rich? What can we do in the absence of government leadership? We can learn from the fact that aspects of our society have been changed in response to public pressures. For example, racial segregation was a way of life for a long time, and was officially sanctified by laws. Most of those laws have been thrown out primarily because of peaceful pressures, not by guns, at least since the Civil War. There was a time when women were considered property. There was a time when many places had state religions, and woe be unto he who didn't follow it. The number is smaller now. Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela didn't have armies behind them, but made enormous strides with peaceful protests. We could ask for amnesty for those military people involved in close encounters with alien craft and beings to tell their stories. We could start slowly, perhaps with events of 50 years ago, then 25, then 10... Desegregation of schools worked best when it was done gradually. This year: first grade. Next year: first and second grade, and so on. We could write letters to editors of major newspapers, seeking communication from military and civilian witnesses and offering anonymity. Some of them are bound to be thinking, as General DuBose told me in his mid-80s, \"What can they do to me now?\" We can try to get schools of journalism to teach students about the mass of factual information available about flying saucers. We can loudly insist that budgets for black projects be reduced and discussed more in public. Who are they serving? Who profits? We who have a serious interest in and knowledge of flying saucers could get together to respond to foolish TV programs and stupid articles. The debunking community has been successful in putting anti-flying-saucer-reality junk in Wikipedia and in major magazines. I don't doubt that government disinformation specialists have greatly helped in erecting the laughter curtain. What if major publications were deluged with sensible letters correcting false information published about flying saucers? Being an optimist, I see some helpful glimmers from the media about the sightings in Stephenville, Texas, in January 2008, and the sudden Air Force lies about 10 F-16s being responsible, after denying there were any flying at the time. The Washington Post was successful with considerable effort in blowing the lid off the political Watergate more than 30 years ago. Is it time for the Cosmic Watergate? If our governments (definitely not just the U.S.) are withholding the facts about flying saucers-which they are-what else are they withholding? Is there truly a secret government? Have other items of great importance been withheld? How much has NASA learned about our visitors that we haven't been told? After all, they have observers circling the planet. I, for one, would like to see my great-grandson grow up in a world that has a much truer picture of our planet's place in the scheme of things. I would like to see everyone on the planet recognize that, regardless of all other allegiances, we are all earthlings. Can we not step back and see ourselves as our visitors must see us? I don't think we have to continue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. As a scientist, it seems to me that we should be looking at the evidence, not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion with ridicule and fear. The time for action is now."

Therefore, the visitors will focus on those fundamental ideas that give them this authority and influence. A Second Coming, then, is being prepared by your visitors. The evidence of this, we understand, is already in the world. People do not realize the presence of the visitors or the nature of reality in the Greater Community, and so they will naturally accept their prior beliefs without question, feeling that the time has come for the great return of their Savior and their Teacher. But he who will come will not come from the Heavenly Host, he will not represent Knowledge or the Unseen Ones, and he will not represent the Creator or the Creator's will. We have seen this plan in formulation in the world. We have also seen similar plans carried out in other worlds. In other religious traditions, uniformity will be encouraged by the visitors-what you might call a fundamental kind of religion based upon the past, based upon allegiance to authority and based upon conformity to the institution. This serves the visitors. They are not interested in the ideology and values of your religious traditions, only in their usefulness. The more that people can think alike, act alike and respond in predictable ways, the more useful they are to the collectives. This conformity is being promoted in many different traditions. The intent here is not to make them all the same but to have them be simple within themselves. In one part of the world, one particular religious ideology will prevail; in a different part of the world, a different religious ideology will prevail. This is entirely useful to your visitors, for they do not care if there is more than one religion so long as there is order, conformity and allegiance. Having no religion of their own that you could possibly follow or identify with, they will use yours to engender their own values. For they value only total allegiance to their cause and to the collectives and seek your total allegiance to participate with them in ways that they prescribe. They will assure you that this will create peace and redemption in the world and the return of whatever religious image or personage is considered of the greatest value here. This is not to say that fundamental religion is governed by alien forces, for we understand that fundamental religion has been well established in your world. What we are saying here is that the impulses for this and the mechanisms for this will be supported by the visitors and used for their own purposes. Therefore, great care must be given by all who are true believers in their traditions to discern these influences and to counteract them if possible. Here it is not the average person in the world that the visitors seek to convince; it is the leadership.",

Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

It is a difficult task and a difficult message. We understand the problems that people may have in receiving this communication. They may question our method of communicating. They may question, certainly, our reality and identity and the trustworthiness of our words. They may question the reality that we are presenting. And perhaps the temptation to deny these things will be great for some people. Yet what will really enable you to hear our words and to know their authenticity will be your ability to respond with the deeper knowing within yourself. Throughout our discourses, we have referred to the reality of Knowledge, the Spiritual Intelligence that lives within you. We have spoken of its central importance in your preparation for the Greater Community. We have spoken of it as the true power that enables you to see beyond all the deceptions and manipulations of the Intervention. we have spoken of it as the inherent power that the Collectives do not use and do not recognize-Knowledge. This Knowledge is not like a military power. It is not something that you can use to gain things by force or to overwhelm or dominate others. It is the greater Spiritual Intelligence that you share with the Creator. Humanity has a great challenge before it and is facing a great risk in its emergence into the Greater Community. Therefore, it is necessary to find the strength that will enable you to unite your peoples and to take your place in the Greater Community as a free and self-determined race. This power must come from within people and must be reinforced by the greater forces for good that exist both within your world and in the Greater Community. There will perhaps be people who will reject our words and counsel and reject what we are presenting altogether. They may have their own preferences in the matter. They may have their own fear and sense of inadequacy. Perhaps they have fallen prey already to the persuasions of the Intervention and do not wish to consider that they may be in error. Perhaps they are just too afraid to face this great challenge. Perhaps they want to escape into their personal concerns and preoccupations. But what is really being called for here is the power and the presence of this Spiritual Intelligence we call Knowledge, which is the source of your real conscience. Yet what you may not realize is that this is the very source and bond of all spirituality in the universe. The expressions of spirituality and the rituals of spirituality, the great Teachers and emissaries of spirituality are too numerous to count in the universe. The philosophies and the methodologies are unique to cultures and their histories. But at the center is this mysterious and profound power that enables you to see, to know and to act in harmony with the Creator of all life. Surely our presence and our words can be rejected and denied. But with Knowledge, this will not be the case. For we are certain that we are presenting the truth to the best of our ability. Your allies abroad have sent us here on a mission in great service to humanity. The integrity of our mission and of our presentation is real and genuine. It is not merely a matter of perspective or perception. We must rely upon this Spiritual Power within you, the reader and the receiver of our message. For indeed, we are revealing more than our words can convey. We are revealing an entire reality of life in the universe. We are opening the door to the great mysteries that humanity has not yet penetrated, and in some cases has not even considered. Though we are very different from you and though we practice our spirituality in ways that are unique to us and that you could not really accommodate, what we emphasize is absolutely fundamental to your being, to your nature and to your reality.",
        "text_source": "  Endings   The crop circles present us with a view of the world that is rich with meaning and metaphor; they make visible the very designs of matter and life. The spaces they create are an invitation to come and take part in an exploration of these universal structures; to recognize the connection of all things in the patterned fabric of creation. They also seem to suggest that these shapes and patterns are an intimate part of our own thought processes; and that they are an archetypal structure upon which not only matter and life are based, but also lie at the heart of the structure of consciousness itself. That sense of familiarity the circles sometimes evoke \u2013 that uncanny feeling that you know what these shapes are and what they mean, and that they are somehow vitally important \u2013 make so much more sense when looked at from this viewpoint. The circles seem concerned with rebalancing our world-view and our sense of reality. In their own way, they are raising awareness of the fact that there is meaning as well as function behind creation, and that life and everything concerned with it has an innate purpose. No matter how you feel that the crop circles may have originated, they are bringing a richness and depth of inspiration to the fore. They 'en-soul' our world and breathe life and colour into the scientific machinery currently used to describe our universe. The circles seem to engender a view that such machinery is but the skeleton or bare bones of the universe, and that what we now need to understand is the flesh, the life-blood and heart of the wonderful creation around us. Is there more to this reality than we can currently see? A cursory glance over the rich legacy of legend and myth held by our world's many cultures suggests that there is far more to our reality than we currently acknowledge in our minds and hearts. The crop circles are our 'signs and wonders', our symbols and guides, our dreams and aspirations made manifest in the fields. They are a counterbalance to the mechanical and functional reality that the western world promulgates. They are mandalas of healing that have spread across the face of the earth; they are an unconscious expression of our need to re-order and reconsider. In our turbulent times, the human race is faced with many choices and many dilemmas, and is being asked to re-evaluate its attitudes towards numerous issues, especially war and the environment. Perhaps the crop circles are an outward sign that this process is firmly under way. Throughout this book we have looked at a whole gamut of components which may be behind the crop circles. We have looked at earth energies, pizo-electrical effects, magnetic effects and the link between vibration and the formation of shape. We have looked at the astonishing use of number symbolism encoded in the circles and what some of that might mean. There are many possibilities for the origins of the circles: earth spirits, extra-terrestrials, extra-dimensional intelligences, Gaia (the consciousness of the earth itself) or, of course, large-scale international hoaxing. Whoever the circle-makers are it is clear they prefer anonymity; it seems to me that they wish to be known by the quality of the fruits of their labour; the crop circles themselves. To be only interested in their identity, or the method by which the circles are made, seems somehow crude in comparison with the elegant and thoughtful works of art they put before us. The crop circles have resisted every attempt made to pin them down or explain them away, and after over fifteen years of being close to this phenomenon I have come respect that. There will always be people who are more interested in probing the circles scientifically, or those who want to spend their time with them building a case to prove or disprove the hoax theory. I am, however, content to sit, watch the the crop circles unfold and pay careful attention. The circles invite us on a journey of mutual exploration; I have the sense that neither side knows where it will end, but that the whole point of our interfacing is ultimately about the quality of the interaction. We began this book by searching for a state of focused openness, one in which we suspended our world-view in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the beautiful crop circles. I suggest that rather than giving up and grasping for any explanation of this amazing phenomenon, we strive to maintain our openness, and approach the circles with the patient attentiveness that their works of art so gracefully demand. Even if the mystery of the crop circles is never answered conclusively, they will leave an enduring impact on those who took the time to observe them. They will have changed forever their view of life and reality. And for those who may come long after the circles have disappeared, these pictures will serve as a snapshot of these difficult but hope-filled times. Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. July 1991.

        "text_target": "This is a very great time for humanity, but humanity is not prepared. From our vantage point, we can see this on a larger scale. We do not involve ourselves with the daily lives of individuals in the world. We do not attempt to persuade governments or to lay claim to certain parts of the world or to certain resources that exist here. Instead, we observe, and we wish to report what we observe, for this is our mission in being here. The Unseen Ones have told us that there are many people today who feel a strange discomfort, a sense of vague urgency, a feeling that something is going to happen and that something must be done. Perhaps there is nothing within their daily sphere of experience that justifies these deeper feelings, that verifies the importance of these feelings, or that gives substance to their expression. We can understand this because we have been through similar things ourselves in our own histories. We represent several races joined together in our small alliance to support the emergence of Knowledge and Wisdom in the universe, particularly with races that are on the threshold of emerging into the Greater Community. These emerging races are particularly vulnerable to foreign influence and manipulation. They are particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding their situation and understandably so, for how could they comprehend the meaning and the complexity of life within the Greater Community? That is why we wish to play our small part in preparing and in educating humanity. In our first discourse, we gave a broad description of the visitors' involvement in four areas. The first area is the influence on important people in positions of power in governments and at the head of religious institutions. The second area of influence is on people who have a spiritual inclination and who wish to open themselves to the greater powers that exist in the universe. The third area of involvement is the visitors' building of establishments in the world in strategic locations, near population centers, where their influence on the mental environment can be exercised. And lastly, we spoke of their program of interbreeding with humanity, a program which has been underway for quite some time.",
        "text_source": "Abduction experiences also open the consciousness of abductees as I work with them to cycles of birth and death that are reminiscent of the Tibetan transitional realities or bardos (Sogyal Rinpoche 1992). This is most clearly illustrated in the past life experiences that are emerging increasingly in our sessions as I have become willing to listen to them. These reports suggest that individual consciousness may have its own line of development, separate from the body. In our sessions abductees such as Dave, Joe, Catherine, and Eva have told with great feeling of periods of embodiment, followed by deaths quite vividly reexperienced. They speak of a return to or diffusion into some sort of primal or universal creative consciousness or source, and then a later rebirth through a woman's womb into a new embodiment on Earth. The transition at the time of bodily death seems to include, as Joe recounted, a feeling of being literally lighter and thinner. \"It's good to be back,\" he said. 'This is much more real.\" Eva reported \"going up, expanding, joy.\" She went \"into a white, gold light\" and saw a dove released from a cage. ''That's my soul,\" she said. In certain cases the alien beings, who seem to reside or belong in this fluid dimension (although they periodically become embodied \u00b7 to some degree on Earth), seem to have been with the abductees through more than one lifetime. As discussed in considerable detail in Dave's and Joe's cases, it is possible to trace a development or evolution of consciousness in the sequence of lives that they have experienced over time. It is not necessary to postulate that a past life identity belongs literally to the individual abductee in the same way that our bodies are only ours while we inhabit them. As biologist Rupert Sheldrake has suggested, it is possible that there exi sts a kind of eternal collective memory on which we all may draw. One might, Sheldrake suggests, \"tune in to particular people in the past who are now dead, and, through morphic resonance, pick up memories of past lives.\" This does not prove, he says, that \"you were that person\" (Sheldrake 1992). This idea is consistent with the observation that the psyche or memory of the abductees seems to be able to travel, especially during the opening of consciousness that occurs in our sessions, to wherever or whenever the evolutionary requirement of the moment seems to take it. THE PARADIGM SHIFT Needless to say none of this makes much sense within the modern worldview brought to us by Western science, whose \"governing assumption,\" in philosopher Richard Tamas's words, is that \"any meaning the human mind perceives in the universe does not exist intrinsically in the universe but is projected onto it by the human mind\" (Tamas, in progress). To Tamas \"this complete voiding of the cosmos, this absolute privileging of the human\" is perhaps the ,\"ultimate anthropocentric projection, the most subtle yet prodigious form of human self-aggrandizement\" and represents an intellectual \"hubris of cosmic proportions.\" The experiences recounted by the abductees with whom I have worked during the past four years constitute, I think, a rich body of evidence to support the idea that the cosmos may contain at least a few types of beings or intelligences whose source and purpose is quite unknown to us. Abductees may be led through their experiences to feel that the cosmos is inherently intelligent in sub- , tie, complex, and exquisite ways that they can hardly begin to fathom. I am reminded, particularly, of Carlos here. Other evidence, including the thoroughly documented near-death experiences and extraordinarily intricate and symbolic crop formations appearing all over the world, provide additional indications, if we will allow ourselves to realize their implications, of various expressions of intelligence in a universe that is reaching toward us. As I come to the end of this story I cannot help wondering what it might take to bring about the shift in consciousness in the society as a whole, the change of paradigm, that is implicit in what the abductees have undergone. It would appear that what is required is a kind of cultural ego death, more profoundly shattering (a word that many abductees use when they acknowledge the actuality of their experiences) than the Copernican revolution which demonstrated that the earth, and therefore humankind, did not reside at the center of the cosmos. UFO abductions and related phenomena suggest first that humans are not the preeminent intelligent beings in a universe more or less empty of conscious life. But abductees' experiences also indicate that we are participating in a cosmos that contains intelligent beings that are far more advanced than we are in certain respects and have the power to render us helpless for purposes we are only just beginning to fathom."
