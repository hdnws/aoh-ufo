        "text_source": "CULTURE SHOCK  Our own galaxy-one of an infinite number-is comprised of several hundred billion stars, and statistically, it is probable that life has evolved on some planetary systems to the extent that space travel and colonization are commonplace. In assuming that the lifetime of advanced civilizations is ten million years, science writer Ian Ridpath has speculated that there could be as many as one million advanced civilizations like ourselves or more advanced in our galaxy, and surmises that the main interest of an old and advanced civilization may be in the developing creatures of the Galaxy, as the anthropologists of the Western world are increasingly fascinated by the stone- age societies that remain on Earth.23 Dr. Bernard Oliver, of NASA's SETI project, has remarked on the possibility that an interconnecting galactic community of advanced cultures already exists. Although some astronomers and exobiologists concur that we may have been visited in the distant past, and are certain to be visited in the future, present-day visits are out of the question. The logic of such reasoning escapes me. The fact that contact has been restricted to relatively few people so far, rather than being on a wide scale, may be for a number of sound reasons-not least of which the cultural shock that would be engendered. For us this could hold more danger than the combination of nuclear arms, energy shortages, overpopulation, dwindling resources and pollution, believes Edward Ashpole, author of The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Some visitors may not want us to know what they are doing here, and in any event, can probably go about their business with none of us any the wiser (particularly if they are able to function in another dimension!). It is therefore likely that those who have been contacted are fed a certain amount of false information. Disinformation could well be an inevitable consequence of contact. Others may be so advanced, technologically, culturally, and spiritually , that contact with our relatively retarded species might be seen as disadvantageous to both parties. In this regard, the comments made by Daniel Fry's alleged extraterrestrial friend in 1949 are worth recounting. We will never attempt to thrust either our knowledge or our culture upon your people, he said, and we will never offer it unless there is substantial evidence that they desire it, and that it would be advantageous to them. There is certainly no such evidence at the present time. It is also true that the purpose of this visit is not entirely philanthropic, since there are some materials upon your planet which we could use to the advantage of both our peoples; materials which you have in abundance but which are rather scarce elsewhere in this solar system. While the use of some of these materials would be of assistance to us, our services to your people will not be made contingent upon such use. Any knowledge or aid which we can give will be freely offered. . . . If we took steps to force the acceptance of our reality upon their consciousness, Fry was told, about 30 percent of the people would consider us as gods, and could attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their welfare. This is a responsibility we could not be permitted to assume, even if we were able to discharge it, which of course, we are not. Most of the remaining 70 percent would adopt the belief that we were potential tyrants or dictators, who were planning to enslave their world, and many would begin to seek means to destroy us. Regardless of whether or not we believe Daniel Fry's contact story to be pure fiction, the sentiments expressed by the alleged extraterrestrial accord well with some modern-day thinking. The perceptive writer Michael Michaud, former director of the Office of Advanced Technology at the United States Department of State, for example, points out that we are likely to project our hopes, fears, and prejudices on to a hypothetical alien culture. At one extreme, he writes, we think of aliens as altruistic teachers, who will show us the road to survival, wisdom and prosperity, or God-like figures who will raise humanity from its fallen condition. At the other, we see the aliens as implacable, grotesque conquerors whose miraculous but malevolently applied technology can only be overcome by simple virtues. ...  Michaud goes on to speculate that contact would probably cause many people to attribute events to alien intervention, citing the present cultural response to the UFO phenomenon as an example.27 And in discussing other problems of contact, Michaud also comes remarkably close to the truth, as I see it. He reasons that individual nations or special interest groups might try to conduct exclusive dialogues with the aliens in order to exploit the contact, and continues:  Political and governmental leaders would be concerned about the impact that contact could have on their populations, and might try to let through only those ideas they considered safe. National security policy-makers might argue for classification of the contact and the information received. Some scholars, particularly those personally involved in the first contact, might be equally possessive about the information and the channel, especially if they distrusted governments and held a low opinion of the general population. As Bob Lazar stresses, although advanced alien technology could be put to use for the benefit of all, the same technology could equally well be used for destructive purposes, such as the construction of a superbomb. Michael Michaud foresees another problem relating to the acquisition of alien technology: that it could undermine our spirit of invention and independent initiative, forcing massive readjustment and unemployment, and threatening existing economic institutions. I take the view that those few within governments who are aware of the situation are acting in our best interests by gradually presenting the information in such a way that it will lessen the political, economic, religious, and psychological shock. But eventually, the ultimate secret will be revealed. The truth about UFOs may be painful for us to face, and this might provide a continuing rationale for the government to maintain secrecy, says the astrophysicist Dr. Brian O'Leary. But the truth will and must be known eventually. Continuing our denials and fears, in my opinion, [is] only adding to the problem. We are all in this together. The evidence available to me suggests that we are being visited by a number of extraterrestrial groups.31 Some could be here for less than benign purposes, others perhaps visiting as anthropologists or even tourists. But it seems logical that some groups, motivated by a vested interest in the survival of our planet and its species, have established contact with a relatively small number of our people, partly perhaps to lend us a helping hand as we reach, falteringly, toward the stars. Let us hope that the advantages of contact will ultimately outweigh the disadvantages, leading to a more complete and profound understanding of our place in the universal scheme."

        "text_source": "The U.S. government-funded SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program, which operates on the assumption that extraterrestrial intelligence could be found by sending radio waves out into the universe, illustrates this bias. The possibility that advanced intelligences might not choose to communicate with us through such a tiny or limited technological aperture, seeking perhaps some fuller opening of our consciousness, seems not to have occurred to its inventors. As philosopher Terence McKenna has suggested, \"To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture-bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant\" (McKenna 1991). It is not altogether clear to me why we become so attached to our ways of seeing the world. Perhaps a comprehensive scientific paradigm, like any ideology, gives a sense of mastery and power. Mystery and the sense of not knowing are antithetical to the need to maintain control and seem, at times, to inspire such terror that we fear that we might blow apart, like the frog in the Tibetan story when confronted with a universe too vast to comprehend. This might explain why it is the intellectual and political elite in our culture that seems most deeply wedded to perpetuating the materi alist view of reality. The UFO abduction phenomenon, which strikes at the heart of the Western paradigm and reveals us to be utterly without control, is more readily accepted at the grassroots level than by the culturally sophisticated or most intellectually advanced among us. For it is, to a large degree, the scientific and governmental elite and the selected media that it controls that determine what we are to believe is real, for these monoliths are the principal beneficiaries of the dominant ideology. This \"politics of ontology\" (Mack 1992) is then the primary arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our homes and abduct our people would create particular problems . This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories. There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the meaning of our \"power\" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik Erikson called .. pseudospeciation\"}, is the source of prodigious suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distraction from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking the phenomenon and its implications seriously. The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of economic \"indicators\" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called \"market forces\") is not controlled, inequities in the distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen, giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It does not, cannot, \"save\" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed, the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,, profoundly \"enlightening\" in the fullest sense. The UFO abduction phenomenon presents a particular problem for some organized religions. From the beginnings of history groups of human beings, recognizing the power and potential perils of spirit forces \"out there,\" have taken upon themselves the task of guiding us through the \"ultimate matters\" (Zock 1990) of life. Religious leaders instruct us in the nature of God, and determine for us what spirit beings or other entities may exist in the cosmos. The Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, for example, in its zeal to impose a particular sort of monotheism based on the Trinity, quite ruthlessly suppressed the nature-worshipping polytheism of much of Europe."

        "text_source": "Though science has inadvertently become our ally, too many individual scientists remain mired in past attitudes. Indifference to an objective consideration of the mass of available UFO data is still the norm. It is our profound hope that Sight Unseen will alert open-minded members of the scientific community to the need to join in this crucially important investigation. Our second goal in writing this book is to provide enough specific information about the aliens' behavior on our planet to enable readers to form their own judgments about its intent and its future course. We have presented nearly a score of UFO abduction cases and provided many verbatim transcripts of the abductees' interviews, letters, and hypnotic sessions. As most of our readers are probably aware, the actual range of this firsthand testimony is far more consistent than the bewildering range of opinions theorists have issued about the meaning of it all. On one end of the scale is what we might call the ultraparanoid interpretation: that the aliens are demons, beings who have come here to capture and devour our children, to use human body parts as replacements, and to feast upon what General Buck Turgison in Dr. Strangelove called our vital bodily fluids. There is not, in our opinion, a scintilla of evidence supporting such a dire and melodramatic reading of the data. On the other end of the spectrum is the idea-hope is perhaps a better word-that the aliens are here as quasi-godlike beings to help us with our problems, to heal our damaged planet, and to offer what has been called, with a straight face, unconditional love. No one who reads the accounts we have been presenting can come to such a rosy- and simplistic-conclusion. The truth is, of course, that we do not know the future. We do not know the aliens' ultimate intentions, nor do we really know what their options are. As the reader may have discerned, Hopkins and Rainey have somewhat differing views about alien intent. We do not share the same balance between hope and pessimism. On the one hand, Rainey suggests: What the ETs may be creating are not hybrids at all but transgenic human beings. It is both biologically possible and would best fit the profile of a secretive, invasive force that might be intent on conquering us from within-or equally possible, healing or altering the genes that no longer work for us in our present environment. The change could happen one genetic code word at a time-or an entire chromosome at a time. Either way, if the genes to be modified were carefully and expertly selected over thousands of years, we might never notice what was happening. The Hollywood-style massive destruction and cultural devastation seen in the movie Independence Day would never have to be played out. Biologists tell us that an entire species can do most of its changing internally, with new species traits only gradually manifesting themselves in outward appearance and behavior. If this is indeed occurring, will these alterations be good for the humans-or bad for the humans? This is a difficult issue to take in both emotionally and intellectually: The subtle but inexorable alteration of the human species. But it may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own has already mastered the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the lifeforms on Earth from those of other planets-or even, perhaps, in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, and with only a handful of mainstream scientists willing or able to risk ridicule and loss of funding, people worldwide who are experiencing the UFO abduction phenomenon firsthand have little choice. They can only hope and pray that these alien beings know what they're doing. On the other hand, Hopkins cautions, in such a transaction the odds favor us losing and the aliens gaining. He states: The twenty-seven years I have spent working with abductees, listening to their traumatic encounters, and trying to help them heal a lifetime of psychic damage, have left me hardened to reassuring talk of beings of light practicing benevolent tough love. I have seen too much pain to allow myself more than a life-sustaining modicum of hope. And yet, I may be wrong. Though abductions inevitably leave the abductees scarred, emotionally and psychologically, there is no sign that this kind of psychic damage was intended. In fact, there are many indications that the UFO occupants try to minimize the pain and emotional damage their activities naturally inflict."

        "text_source": "It seems to many UFO abduction investigators that the latter remark describes precisely what seems to be lacking in both the ETs and in the transgenic beings we believe they are coproducing with our involuntary help. The evidently cloned children with alien-human appearance that Jen saw on the playground seemed passive, expressionless, and unused to the simplest of sensations-like the feel of sand trickling through one's fingers. It's no wonder these transgenic children seen aboard craft might be described as having the failure to thrive syndrome. They seem thin, listless, and nonresponsive. Do the aliens expect these children to take their places in our society as Mr. Paige and Damoe evidently did? Or do these children represent an interim stage in an overall alien plan to develop beings more like us in many ways-with our vital genetic diversity and our emotions, which actually have a survival purpose in our society. Or perhaps we flatter ourselves with this speculation, and all the ETs are interested in is getting the technical part right. They seem to have gone a long way toward producing serviceable facsimiles of humans who answer to them. The models seem to be getting better and better. The old debate still rages on over what is the most powerful influence to shape human beings (or any sentient being): Is it nature or nurture? But it's possible that both our great human vulnerability and our strength lies in our ongoing desire to attend to both equally. We earthlings value our science; we don't mind tinkering with nature if it seems to confer some genetic advantage on us, rather than the next guy; we're even drawn to some of the more radical new abilities of genetics to make designer babies free of defects. But we know that nature won't paint the whole picture, either-that these small bundles of neurons, muscles, blood, and bone, these offspring of ours, will also grow out of the environment we create and the examples we set. We will need to intentionally nurture our children into becoming loving, empathetic, and ethical adults, responsible to the rest of society. But what happens to a species like ours that might become infiltrated by a subpopulation of bioengineered people who never knew the nurturance side of the equation? ETs may be on the way to creating an increasingly perfect facsimile of a human being, but we don't yet see convincing evidence that they understand what lies behind the scenery of a fully fleshed-out human existence-qualities such as emotional openness, the courage to act independantly as a moral being, the desire to nurture others as you were once nurtured-or to nurture another person even if you were not. We don't know if this new variant species of mankind, intentionally created by the Other, is here to offer us earthlings fresh knowledge and profound insights from the farside of the cosmos, or whether it intends to deliberately betray us into the service of its own extraterrestrial creators. In the meantime, it seems that all we can do is to continue to bear witness and offer modest emotional support-through conversations, letters, phone calls, and writing-to the thousands of people undergoing these experiences. We, as well as the abductees, look toward the day that it dawns on the scientific, political, educational, and spiritual institutions of this small planet that their understanding and guidance are terribly lacking in dealing with this strange experience that touches every dimension of what it means to be human."

We treasure the illusion that we alone are indigenous to Earth, and will remain so. But, as one of Leo Dworshak's alien friends reaffirmed as far back as 1936, this planet was their concern, that Man has his own mind, and that he must learn to take care of his planet if he wants to keep his home. [He] assured me our planet would continue to exist. But I was not assured that Man would continue to exist on it, if he did not learn to take better care of his most valuable possession. And as Thomas and his military team (Chapter 10) were warned: Our  own  activities  required  monitoring  by  other  than  human  beings, simply because Earth is a vital and necessary planet for others. We could not be permitted to despoil it even though despoliation had begun and we were doubted as to our integrity and genuine concern for the planet and its myriad life forms. The aliens reiterated that the overpopulation of Earth, combined with pollution, would lead to catastrophic consequences during the twenty-first century. As the Amicizia group informant explained to Nikola Duper in 2009: The Friends are our elder brothers. They are human. Indeed, in comparison it's we terrestrials who are less than human. Individuals from various other populations are among us, because the Earth is a very particular planet inside the economy of this part of the Universe. . . . There is said to be an ongoing conflict between various species regarding the future of our planet. Other populations in the Universe have chosen Evil, the informant points out. This dualism between Good and Evil is fundamental in order to understand both the still-ongoing Struggle and why it is so hard for truth to be disclosed to the inhabitants of our planet. . . . Other populations are here for other reasons, and the abduction by extraterrestrials of terrestrials, as well as the creation of hybrids, is a reality that the Friends told us about as far back as the 1960s. . . . The enemies are trying to conquer our planet in a very gradual and seemingly  painless  way,  most  of  all  working  over  our  minds. Unfortunately , this is not science fiction. If only it were so! [And] this is not paranoia. . . . However, just hinting at these subjects leads to the discrediting of the person who says or writes them; and this is a powerful weapon in the hands of those who want to harm us. As to what the future will bring, I do not pretend to know. But I have been assured-by those who do know-that the alien situation presents the most profound dilemma facing humankind on Earth."

        "text_source": "For as they undergo their own ego-destroying terror, and allow us to know about their experiences, their consciousness opens to the existence of unknown dimensions of the cosmos and the human psyche, which themselves appear increasingly to be profoundly interwoven. The inner work of the abductees, by enabling them to acknowledge their experiences, has allowed some of them to appreciate the importance of the gifts they have to offer. I am often asked why, if UFOs and abductions are real, the spaceships do not show up in more obvious form. \"Why don't they land on the White House lawn?\" is the reigning cliche. The most popular answer to this question among those who take the phenomenon seriously is that the aliens do not dare to manifest themselves more directly. Government leaders would panic, might attack them, and surely would not know how to avoid scaring the rest of us. I believe that there is a better answer to this question, one that is more consistent with the i nformation contained in this book. The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend. The connecting principle, the force that expands our consciousness beyond ourselves, appears to be love. In the discovery of a fundamental, loving interconnectedness, we might overcome the sense of fragmentation and evolve toward wholeness as individuals, family members, and planetary citizens. From this perspective, the earth would no longer be simply a marketplace, its lands and resources divided among competing human groups. The earth would become the jewel in the crown of our being, the place where we experience once again our connection with a cosmic Source from which we have become too separate. As our psyches open, we could abandon the dualistic thinking that has divided mind from matter and the physical from the spiritual world. The alien beings have come to the abductees from a source that remains unknown to us. We still do not fully grasp their purposes or their methods. It seems clear, however, that \"they\" have had to come to \"us,\" appearing in material form so that we might know them. Some have speculated that the alien beings have mastered time travel and come to us from the future. Sometimes they even communicate that this might be so. We do not know. But . the guiding or regenerative myth of the abduction phenomenon offers a new story for a world that has survived many holocausts and may yet be deterred from a final cataclysm. The abduction phenomenon, it seems clear, is about what is yet to come. It presents, quite literally, visions of alternative futures, but it leaves the choice to us."

Which means that these changes, whatever they are, will be passed down to their own children and their children's children. In an environment where desperation for a child and commercial enterprise jointly conjure up the power to force nature's hand, who on Earth is looking out for the future of the species? If we Americans aren't doing it-and we clearly aren't moving as quickly as our science and technologies are-it's easy to see why many people might be hopeful that the alien visitors to our planet are overseeing our future-that they are the benign outside force that ensures we'll be able to survive whatever catastrophic event comes our way, as such things inevitably do. The more optimistic branch of ufologists likes to say that such benign oversight is precisely what the aliens are doing each time they swoop down and take people off to their mysterious laboratories. But we have no way presently to confirm that belief-or to flat-out refute it. We don't know what the aliens are up to any more than scientific oversight committees know the inner workings of the thousands of privately funded fertility clinics around the world. In fact, you might fairly state that the UFO occupants are operating without federal oversight (none that we know of, at least) or informed consent. And, according to the 1991 Roper Poll on Unusual Personal Experiences, there are an estimated 2 percent of adult Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consistent with those of the abduction phenomenon. The scope of the aliens' apparent genetic mission is staggering. And here we sit, in the dark about their ultimate purpose. Unfortunately, unless we can get the human race to focus on this problem-or until the aliens tell us what they're up to-we're likely to remain in that state of darkness for a long time. My own concern is not that we are being altered, because that is an ongoing natural process, the slow, evolutionary morphing of the Earth and all the organisms in and on it. For centuries, people have believed that a power larger than themselves-whether they define that as God or the laws of nature-has been the unseen force determining their collective futures. While the religious trusted their respective gods, the scientists put just as much faith in the laws of nature as the ultimate shapers of our destinies. There was a certainty, an order, inherent in either belief system. But then who are these little gray humanoids popping in and out of our world, taking our sperm and ova and skin samples, only to present us later with what they say are our offspring-wan, listless, big-eyed infants whom some people have cradled in the palm of one hand? They are, to borrow a famous phrase, neither fish nor fowl. The aliens don't fit anybody's conception of a being made in God's image-certainly not the God of the Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus. And, according to most scientists, UFOs and their occupants are not possible (or acceptable) in the realms of science, either. The UFO occupants' ambiguity, their elusiveness in being categorized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius, it seems to me. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, efficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without our permission, and without official public acknowledgment that something significant is happening to us as a species. In comparison, my thoughts turn back to the fertility clinic in New Jersey. What if it was suspected that some such institute was covertly, experimentally manipulating the genetic structure of not thirty human embryos but five million embryos? Would anyone in high places take it seriously? Would renowned scientists speak up? With the threat of a public uprising, would the government offer immediate resources to uncover the facts? Or, because the idea is so inconceivable, so overwhelming, would we simply turn away and laugh it off?"

Our complete disregard for the environment has already taken an enormous toll on all living things, and is easily seen on a planetwide scale. As I write this, a sunken oil tanker sits at the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Spain. If its hull ruptures (and many experts believe it will), the oil it releases into the ocean will be double what was spilled by the Exxon Valdez. We cannot go on like this. Clearly, a change in human attitude is called for. In my view, the number of crop circles that are manmade versus those that are not, has become irrelevant. All the signs in the fields play a role in awakening mankind to the ongoing opportunity to reverse our self-destructive course and achieve true spiritual maturity. To convince the masses of the importance of this quest, however, we must all do our work, and speak our message, with humility, respect, and above all, honesty. We are all in this together: researchers, the lay public and those who make counterfeit crop circles."

        "text_source": "Our research project began in August, 1995. Since that time we have traveled a road filled with twists, turns, embankments, cliffs and ambushes. There were times when we were encouraged and uplifted and at other times discouraged. However, I did not give in to these feelings. This in part was due to my burning desire for knowledge and the encouragement of friends who urged me on. One of these was Whitley Strieber, who constantly pointed out the importance of the work we were engaged in. Another person who inspired me was my cousin Ken Ring. The primary goal I pursued was to marry hard science to a subject regarded by many as a fringe area, to say the least and more often was regarded as pseudoscience. In looking back on our endeavors, I can say without reservation that in my opinion, this goal was accomplished. However, because of unhelpful comments from the public at large and the armchair scientific community, it became necessary to restrict our communication on the internet. Many times, outside of public view, I found information exchanges occurring among scientists who were debating portions of the data we brought forward. One such debate took place after our July 1997 press conference in Roswell. Several of the scientists who saw the raw data supplied by Dr. VernonClark had questions about the actual mathematics involved in the Silicon isotopic ratios. As it turned out one of the people who made these calculations had erred. The net result was a new calculation which provided even a greater deviant from the terrestrial isotopes than previously recorded. Closing these debates to the general public made this exchange between true scientists possible. The increasing interest generated by the scientific community is what we feel is needed to have our research published in a major scientific journal. We look forward to this occurring in the very near future. Since our approach to ufology ultimately involves the scientific study of physical evidence, our ultimate goal seems possible to many of our colleagues: actually capturing one or more of the elusive beings which are entering our environment. I feel that any creature which operates in our three-dimensional world has habits. If this is correct, these habits can be recorded, correlated, studied and ultimately used to capture these beings. Progress in our investigations is directly related to our ability to pay for the necessary work. Our efforts to raise funding have been diverse. Among numerous avenues, we believe the entertainment industry may provide the much-needed capital to continue our endeavors. We are looking forward to a one-hour television production based on our work which we hope will be shown world-wide. If this comes about, the funds generated will go directly into our research and allow it to continue without interruption. It has been made very clear to us that there is a large amount of physical evidence being kept secret. Many of the individuals with this evidence have deep fears of reprisal from government agencies. Because we have taken the scientific approach to this subject, we have been able to dampen some of their fears. In addition, our policy has always been to accommodate the requests of anyone who wishes to turn physical evidence over to us. If they request anonymity, we are always happy to comply. One of the prime examples concerned the piece of material believed to be from the Roswell crash site. In dealing with the supplier of this material, we demonstrated that we would live up to the agreement we had made with him. We did not release one iota of information about him. Because we demonstrated our sincerity, he trusted us with additional information. Another of our goals is to extend our research to an international level. We look forward to the time when we can arrange for the performance of surgical procedures in such countries as Brazil, England, Mexico, Japan, Ecuador, Australia and Puerto Rico. I would like to give assistance without charge to the people of these countries. We want to help with their physiological and emotional needs. During our travels we began to realize that the abduction phenomenon is a world-wide issue. Its effects seem to vary with respect to specific geographical areas. The effects on the individual are also varied. We feel that this is sometimes due to the lack of communication between the victim and their friends and relatives. Other psychological effects were also apparent, including memories of strange dreams, a host of sudden generated fears and phobias such as fear of animals with large eyes and clowns. I was a personal witness to one such case in Brazil where a young female abductee became hysterical when a person dressed in a clown costume jumped out into a street, crowded with people. It took several of us to calm her down. In addition to the psychological trauma produced by isolation there are a myriad of physical effects which go untreated. Many abductees suffer dermatological effects such as the sudden appearance of strange skin markings or changes in pigment or color. Other effects are the craving of salt substances, feelings of dehydration, and sometimes the generalized feelings of flu-like symptoms with muscle aches and pains. Another one of our goals is to solidify abduction research. One of the most disconcerting trends in this regard has to do with the lack of uniform procedures among researchers. I look toward the day when there will be a standardization of investigation procedures and hypnotic regressions. If this is accomplished, the data could be placed in one common database and therefore the same information would be available to all researchers, no matter where they may be located. I believe the only way research should be done is to provide the means for all researchers to draw from a common database. It seems impossible for anyone to reach a valid conclusion unless the information is available to all parties having data which bear on the situation. I believe also that it is imperative that this information be disseminated among medical professionals. I wonder how many abductees pass through the general medical community with no attention being paid to their specific needs. I also have concerns as to the number of possible abductees who have been confined to mental hospitals with false diagnoses. Since I have surgically removed numerous foreign objects from feet during the past thirty years, I am acutely aware of how many objects were removed and probably thrown away having undergone little scrutiny or a vague diagnosis. All doctors performing these surgeries were only concerned about the entities being fully removed or whether the surrounding tissue was benign or malignant. Another of our future efforts will be to hold an abduction conference where every researcher of merit will be able to bring their ideas and suggestions. I envision this as a high-powered event which will attract the best minds in this subject from all over the world. It would be also helpful to include representation from other segments of the scientific community such as psychology, psychiatry, physics and astronomy. What does the future hold for the field of ufology in general? I believe that the complete picture is very complex. Public opinion polls in the United States, shows that the general public believes we are being visited by life forms from elsewhere. I think there is a government coverup in which a controlled dissemination of information about those entities is being made. The book The Day After Roswell written by now retired army Col. Phillip Corso is one of the prime examples. Since his book was released in June 1997, no government official has made an effort to refute his statements which claim that aliens crashed at Roswell and the army recovered them and their craft. He furthermore states that he himself had charge of crash debris and had it researched. Another example of controlled information has to do with the recent deluge of television programming, demonstrated by individual one-hour shows and an onslaught of commercials having to do with alien visitation, not to mention the extraordinary number of major motion pictures dealing with this subject. It seems apparent that the powers that be are attempting to subtly inform the masses that we may have open contact with beings from elsewhere. I do not believe, however, that every source of information coming from the government is inaccurate or incorrect. I believe that many in our government do not have access to this knowledge. This is also true of the very laboratories we are working with on our research. How could we trust their findings if we did not have some trust in the institutions we are dealing with? We found there seems to be a pervasive paranoia amongst certain investigators within the field of ufology, believing they are constantly spied upon and can not trust even the slightest information presented by any laboratory that does government work. I have found it impossible to locate a good laboratory which does not have government contracts. I don't believe that our results have been interfered with or distorted in any way. In another area, hard science itself seems to be providing information to the public which helps to shape public opinion about alien life. This includes the possibility of life on Mars and other planets as well as extraordinary life forms recently discovered on our world such as those micro-organisms which live in some of the hot water vents in the Pacific Ocean. The complexities of modem physics have yielded data recently released to the general public which is also mind-boggling. Subjects such as the possibility of time travel, faster-than-light travel, non-locality of the mind, universal consciousness and particle memory are currently being studied. It appears man's knowledge is undergoing a revolution. Another pioneering area for exploration has to do with the expansion of human consciousness. If beings from elsewhere are engaged in some sort of program to expand human consciousness, they may have created a problem for not only us but also for themselves. If these entities have been continuously manipulating the human race for thousands of years, as the ancient astronaut hypothesis suggests, why do we suddenly recall the abduction process? The awareness of abduction seems to have occurred only within the recent past. Is it possible that our race is becoming more acutely aware of our environment and through this process we have also become aware we are being tampered with?"

        "text_source": "Why should this be so, since every culture from the beginning of recorded time and throughout most of the world, even in our own time, has accepted the existence of other intelligences in the universe? I have discussed already some of the reasons why the reality of the abduction phenomenon has been so difficult for our culture to accept-the material and philosophical vested interests, for example, attached to the Western worldview. But I believe there is a core belief in our culture that is violated by the alien abduction phenomenon, namely the total separation of the spirit and the . physical world. We have made that gulf inviolate, relegating to religion the spirit (subjective) world and assigning to science the material (objective) domain. We simply do not know what to do with a phenomenon that crosses that seemingly inviolable barrier. It shocks the foundations of our belief structure. Our minds have no place to put such a thing. The Dalai Lama once pointed out that the devastation of the planet's ecology was destroying not only the habitat of plants and animals but the realms in which the spirits reside as well. Perhaps this has left them no choice but to manifest in our world, to appear to us in the only \"language\" that remains to us, the language of the physical World. In the context of the planet's crisis they have had no choice, but must find some way, however difficult, to come to us. Perhaps our consciousness has become so atrophied that we are simply unable, on our own, to be open to the spirit world. Could it be that the intense resistance with which the alien abduction phenomenon is sometimes met could be related to the shock it brings to our carefully crafted psychological boundaries, reopening us to a world from which we have distanced ourselves, reanimating those senses whereby we might again know worlds 1 beyond the manifest physical reality? Perhaps we have created the spiritual conditions that have made this necessary."

        "text_source": "Whatever the motivations and whatever the technology in use, this agenda involves all concerned, human and otherwise, and it involves the prime creative force in the universe-the creator of all. As abductee Judy Doraty was told by an alien grey when she asked about God, He's the same to us as He is to you. It would appear that religion-or more specifically spiritualism-is interconnected with the alien agenda. While most religions address facets of spiritual truth, none can claim exclusive knowledge. The world's religions can be compared to the story of the blind men and the elephant. They all have a piece of the truth, but their interpretations may not be on the mark. Today, many feel that organized religion is about the control of understanding. It is the mind of man trying to interpret the heart of God-and not doing a very good job of it. It has been said that every human feeling originates from only two basic emotions-love or fear. Love, the basis of compassion, sympathy, and understanding, stems from man's highest energy level, while fear, the producer of intolerance, hatred, and violence, comes from our basest energy level. Love, said to flow from God, is of the heart. Fear is a product of the mind. Unfortunately, too many religions focus on fear-fear of Satan, fear of death, and fear of the afterlife-to control members. All of humanity may be moving into a higher consciousness. Some call it Christ-Consciousness. There is no question that the old order-the old systems, the old ways of doing things-is crumbling. New dimensions, new realities are on the horizon. And each of us has a role to play. Mankind is only as strong as its weakest link. There are no victims or castaways. Everyone is involved. Each of us is like a tuning fork. When one resonates with the higher frequency of heartfelt love and understanding, others follow. Many feel that the aliens of energy and light, called the Tran-scendentals by the remote viewers, are here to witness-and perhaps help-our shift to new realities. It is literally a rebirth and, like any birth, there will be pain as we all move through the physical transitions. Fear will only make it worse. Yet, fear will continue to be a large part of our experience until we are able to break through the government secrecy and media-driven illusion of life to gain full knowledge of our world, our true history, our future, and our relationship with others in the universe. The advent of the UFO phenomenon on our collective consciousness in recent years may well be a wake-up call-a not-so-subtle message that human intellectual knowledge is not the end-all of existence or any assurance of peace and tranquillity. It won't be proven with a slide rule nor seen in a telescope. For true love and understanding, the basis for everything good and desirable, we must look inward. We all know truth when we hear it. It resonates deep within the individual being. We will know it by the subtle signals from the heart. Mankind in its present growth phase might be compared to the college student, who as a freshman believes she knows everything but as a senior realizes she knows very little. Our adolescence is coming to an end and it is time to break free from Mommy and Daddy-all dogmatic authority figures-and begin to take our rightful place as free-thinking and responsible members of a universal public. After all, to anyone not from Earth, we are the aliens-and fearsome ones at that with our primitive and destructive ways. Perhaps we are the focus of universal concern and are all being guided by a host of nonhuman life-forms. To paraphrase that great possum philosopher Pogo, We have found the alien agenda and it is about us."

        "text_source": "You'd know where all the treasures on Earth are buried. Bodies, too, most likely. What sort of being would you have to be to have such God-like powers? A being from the fifth dimension, just one level up from where we now perceive ourselves to be. Although the rest of us here in our 3-D world (plus space-time) would regard your powers as magical, you'd realize that it's just having a more advantageous perspective that makes such a difference. Some extraterrestrials somewhere may already know how to manipulate spacetime, although it's far in advance of anything we on Earth know how to do. But in the realm of hyperspace, all of these things are theoretically possible. Might these dimensions that scientists say are there but cannot be seen represent the scenery behind which our alien visitors come and go? Some physicists speculate that these extra dimensions might indeed account for paranormal phenomena. In this way, they could have a relevance to UFOs. One reason that UFOs seem to appear and disappear in and out of thin air (among the other possibilities explored earlier in this book) might be that they enter and exit our 3-D space by moving in another spatial dimension. Michael Murphy, in The Future of the Body, states that these hyperdimensional models of the universe have a resonance with esoteric accounts of extraspatial worlds in which our familiar existence is embedded, and from which phantom figures, luminosities, odors of sanctity, and other extrasomic phenomena materialize, and through which highly developed spirit-bodies move. Might our present movement abilities be analogous to those of early amphibians that had not learned to breathe or move freely on land? Many Worlds As early as 1957, the possibility was raised by physicists that during the evolution of the universe, it repeatedly split in half, each split like a fork in the road. If this is correct, the number of universes we might have to take into account are literally infinite. And each universe would be linked to every other at the points of the forks in the road. The many worlds theory allows that all possible quantum worlds exist. For example, in some worlds, humans exist as the dominant life-form on Earth. In other worlds, chemical reactions took place that prevented human life from evolving, and on this same planet another very different lifeform is the reigning species. Parallel Universes Physicist Stephen Hawking's theory of parallel universes takes the many worlds theory a bit further: He believes that there are an infinite number of self-contained universes and that wormholes offer the possibility of tunneling between them. But it's not likely that you'll soon be able to open a door and step into another, parallel universe where your boss never heard of you and your family doesn't know who you are. The connecting wormholes, which are now quite respectable topics of study for science, are thought to be extremely small, about the size of a Planck length-close to a one hundred billion times smaller than a proton. People who hate cramped travel situations might want to opt out of a trip to the neighboring universe until the technical details get worked out and a little more legroom is possible. 24 Multiple worlds are not thought to interact on a regular basis. Certain events, however, may cause tubes or wormholes to open up between them. Communication and travel between universes would then be possible. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) 25 Many physicists currently use quantum theory and experiments to describe the whole of reality as a multiverse that contains vast numbers of parallel or multiple universes. (Drawing by Budd Hopkins) Wormholes through space could also be prime candidates for explaining how UFOs travel from one universe or solar system to another. Having mastered the difficulties of hyperspace, the UFO occupants (or their higher-intelligence leaders) would use these multiple tunnels constructed by nature to take a shortcut between their world and ours. The old argument You can't get here from there would no longer be valid. Harvard's colorful physicist Sidney Coleman has built upon Hawking's work, constructing mathematical arguments that, if correct, suggest that wormholes through space are essential to all physical processes; they're not just the stuff of fantasy. Wormholes, it seems, rather than being science fiction, are the connecting arteries between worlds. These tubes, or tunnels, are essential to keeping our universe somewhat stable, in the same way that rope and pegs hold a tent in place. But at this point, on the human level, the issues are mainly theoretical. What we don't know is whether any other intelligent life has found a way to work with the enormous amount of potential energy available in the near vacuum of empty space. As Kaku says: Any civilization that masters the energy found at the Planck length will become the master of all fundamental forces.18 They will be the masters of hyperspace. Nonlocal Connections Former Apollo astronaut Edgar Mitchell, raised in a Southern Baptist family and later trained in the Western rational, linear mode of thinking at MIT, has spent the last twenty-five years of his life working to integrate the different ways of knowing available to the human consciousness. These ways of knowing, unfortunately, are often separated by Western thought into two opposing states: that of religion (all miracles and faith) and that of science (allowing in only what is material, measurable, and testable). Mitchell left NASA in the early 1970's to found the Institute of Noetic Sciences, where he initiated research into areas of study that are neglected by mainstream science. Using scientific methodologies, Mitchell began experimenting with paranormal phenomena such as extrasensory perception, telepathy, and telekinesis. What Mitchell eventually proposed was a new dyadic model of reality that found a common ground between science and the spirit. Making the Earth Larger English essayist Thomas Browne thought of man as that great and true Amphibian whose nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in diverse elements, but in divided and distinguished worlds.19 [Browne, Religio Medici] In other words, we humans exist on many levels at once, moving through different domains and modes, minute by minute altering our role, electrified in dreams, meditative in everyday thoughts, shot through with emotions and sensory events, even straying at times into interior spaces that seem remote from any recognized human existance. We might suggest that this is the normal human condition, not the anomalous one-not an existence that has to be sought in a nunnery, a zendo, or total absorption in UFO phenomenology. It is conceivable and desirable, Michael Murphy, the originator of the Esalen Institute, points out, to broaden our horizons in this world and open ourselves more and more to the world we now perceive, rather than disengage from it. Perception of new dimensions of the physical world can actually stimulate our evolutionary advance by revealing new territories for the human race to explore and inhabit. By a willingness to explore and inhabit these new dimensions of our physical world, we might be able to truly understand the meaning of a being who appears in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy Perelandra as a thirty-foot giant, burning white-hot, and says to the astonished protagonist: I am not here in the same way you are here. Other scientists, most notably physicist David Bohm, have developed a concept of the world and the human brain that was based on holographic principles. Perhaps you have seen the fascinating displays of laser technology that produce three-dimensional images of objects or beings that seem eminently physical. Yet, if you reach out to touch these laser projections, your hand passes right through them. Edgar Mitchell was involved in a great deal of research indicating that the human brain manages information in a similar way: taking triangulated snapshots of the image before us and storing them away until we need to recreate them again as realistic, 3-D images. Mitchell points out that the brain and every cell of the body is a quantum entity, which means they have both local (particle) and nonlocal (wave) properties. The nonlocal information in our experiences are those that continuously resonate and vibrate with the underlying, infinite, and unstructured energy of the universe. At this point of connection, our individual being contributes its own unique information and experience into that larger force, just as a stream trickles into the river and then into the ocean. Quantum theory attempts to deal with the issue of how these particles stay connected and somehow know what the others are doing. Some physicists refer to that underlying and connective force as the zero-point energy field. But the most useful idea is this: that at extremely subtle levels, the quantum energy given off by every individual carries with it the information of that person's entire inner experience. Not only do you carry around in the essence and atoms of your body all the life experiences of your former years, but those energetic particles of your life are also stored in the shared consciousness of the universe. It's a bit like discovering that your own personal information-address, name, phone number-is tucked away in the massive Manhattan telephone directory or in the largest search engine or databank on the Web. You didn't ask to be there, but there you are, accessible and equal to all other conscious beings who know how to tap into the resources of the nonlocal information system. Further, Mitchell states that it's this mysterious nonlocality that brings new insight to many of the most puzzling and subjective aspects of human consciousness-telepathy, for example. If that is indeed true, perhaps some day none of us will know what it is to live a truly private life-not after the human race masters or reintegrates what are evidently inherent, if unused, abilities within us. Perhaps that's one of the things the aliens are demonstrating on a very small, incremental scale, one abductee at a time: a way of knowing that effortlessly taps into the largest databank available, the centralized energy field of the universe."

        "text_source": "Christianity is a bit different, and there are obvious, identifiable rifts within it. The Roman Catholic church, on the one hand, has for the past few decades gone out of its way to promote the idea of extraterrestrial life. Quite a few statements have issued from the Vatican supporting the notion of an abundance of life in the universe as part of God's great plan. On the other hand, many evangelical Christians will interpret any alleged extraterrestrial presence as demonic. Several passages from the New Testament have been used to support this position. New Age beliefs are different still. Most self-described New Agers are inclined to look at these other beings in a positive light, as humanity's benefactors and even space brothers. Since the 1970s, such beliefs have spread throughout the world, and certainly into the UFO subculture. There is no bridge long enough to join this viewpoint with that of the evangelicals. The rift is irreconcilable and only two things can resolve it. One is an overwhelming amount of new information that will satisfy people to form an opinion. The other is time: time for new generations to arise, with new perspectives that cannot now even be predicted. People can change, but deep changes that affect entire societies can come only from new generations. Although the world's major religions aren't likely to collapse in the short term, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate danger would come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders of history were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanity itself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselves were the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial. One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtext of the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seems unlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claims are made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly cause some sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Most likely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations to be lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religious beliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affecting religion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles on humanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than the cartoon variety of children's stories and moral imperatives that make up most of the major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge of a nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not be satisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality, or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions could easily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives, perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe and practice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new age beliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. In all likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenon will reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness, pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher frequencies, or become proper light vessels for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNA activation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, but they mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growing split in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or will it? Science and the Scientists   The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon will discredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical about UFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different from scientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought and technology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology and genetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health, increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organ regeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas of biotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the major diseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Wood has recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents, that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret study of alien biology and viruses. [369] Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology are probably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied on that black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the form of new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developing a true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop a unified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such a development might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely than not would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind. Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these are fascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to know how human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challenging would be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether or not consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedly fringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presence would throw this investigation into high gear. Current research into abductions and other forms of contact hint not only that space and time have somehow been mastered by these other beings, but that the mind is a critical element in their relationship to us. In this case, by consciousness we mean something that is nonlocal, something like psi phenomena. A series of well-funded scientific studies of the telepathic elements of contact, for instance, could be valuable additions to our knowledge of the mind and of the fabric of our reality. It would also allow science possibly to catch up with what many psychics and intuitives already believe, and even provide a useful framework to help us understand why psi phenomena occurs. Belief in psi is not just a woo woo belief, but supported by research into remote viewing, and goes back through all human religions via the power of prayer and meditation. Ultimately, we want to know if consciousness is more than just our brain chemistry, and whether or not we have a spirit or soul. Some might argue that a study of UFO data does not necessarily warrant that belief. I think, however, there is a case to be made that it does. If so, then human consciousness studies will become more widespread, and many new discoveries will await us. Such sciences, anything from remote viewing to out of body travel and space-time manipulation, are probably being explored now within the black budget world and breakaway civilization. Computing and Technology   We have had a global internet for just over twenty years, during which time it has completely changed our world. Whether or not there is a disclosure about UFOs, it will continue to do so."

        "text_source": "Moreover, the track record of channelers fails to inspire confidence. Believing the claims of all of their contradictory and often mutually exclusive predictions would leave one extremely confused, to say the least. The memory of the failed 2012 Ascension predictions by many channelers and psychics also left a bad taste. Finally, insights or wisdom provided by a channeler is one thing; concluding therefore that they must be accurate when claiming it comes from an extraterrestrial being is quite another. New Age Aliens   Channeling extraterrestrials goes right to the beginning of the modern UFO phenomenon. As early as 1952, a contactee named George Van Tassell claimed to be in telepathic communication with extraterrestrials. He made no paranormal claims, but stated that they used advanced technology to connect with natural human abilities. The name of the being who contacted him, he said, was named Ashtar. Ashtar's earliest messages focused on the dangers from nuclear weapons. They also described an extraterrestrial government that monitored Earth and wanted to improve life for humanity. This was the origin of the idea of Ashtar Command  Soon, Ashtar Command was being channeled by others. The messages did not always agree, and rivalries developed. Many predictions followed, often centering on the imminent arrival of an Ashtar-led armada to guide and protect mankind. During the 1970s, a person known as Tuella began channeling Ashtar Command. Rather than emphasize technology or politics, she focused on inner spiritual development and achieving higher dimensions. This, of course, coincided with the beginnings of the modern New Age movement. Other Ashtar channelers continued to emphasize apocalyptic themes, even stating that Ashtar Command's ships would soon arrive to help people evacuate the planet. One such channeler predicted this would happen in 1994. The Internet gave Ashtar Command a new life. It appears that no matter how many failed predictions exist in one's track record, there are always people who will find a way to believe the next one. Today, after more than half a century of existence, Ashtar Command (now known as Ashtar Galactic Command) seems to work as a kind of committee that keeps control over its messages. Apocalypses are definitely out. But Ashtar Command is just one small part of the modern channeling of alleged extraterrestrials, which exploded into ufology during the 1980s. Barbara Marciniak, for example, began channeling the Pleiadians at that time and gained an influence that is difficult to overstate. [325] Her sessions provided a virtually complete statement of modern New Age philosophy. She was not the first channeler to give such messages, but she was the first popular channeler who explicitly communicated with extraterrestrials and incorporated such a philosophy. Earlier channelers, such as J. Z. Knight, the channeler of Ramtha, essentially offered the same ideas, but Ramtha is Lemurian, not extraterrestrial. And what is that message? In the case of the Pleiadians, they speak to Marciniak from the future. They claim to be one of many extraterrestrial life forms interacting with Earth, not all of which are benevolent. They claim that Earth will experience a major event, beginning in 2012, during which the battle for dominion of our world will take place. Indeed, the original prediction was not for 2012. When it was in made in the early 1990s, it was set for the year 2000. Now that the 2012 prediction seems to have failed, too, perhaps a new date will be set. Or, perhaps it has happened on schedule, since most of us cannot perceive this battle, which is said to occur in the fourth and fifth dimensions, and most of humanity perceives only three dimensions. According to Marciniak's sources, this is because 300,000 years ago, in an earlier struggle for Earth, human DNA was disassembled by malevolent beings from twelve strands to a double helix structure. These beings wanted to keep humanity ignorant so as to feed from our fear, anger, and doubt. The fundamental message is that Reptilians are really in charge of this planet and keep humanity for their own sustenance. In this context, the Pleiadian message via Marciniak is to remind humanity of its divine origins, to trigger its DNA reconstruction, to help people re-assimilate light into their bodies, and raise their frequency. All of this will enable them to travel in higher dimensions and survive the coming upheaval. This is the core of what has been called the Ascension process. It has also become the foundation of the New Age belief system insofar as it is connected to UFO studies. But it is more likely the message, and not the cosmology, that has attracted most adherents. The message, in essentials, is one that has been channeled for a long time, including in the Seth books by Jane Roberts, and even before: that each person creates his or her own reality by their thoughts and intentions. You create your reality by your thoughts. Some people take this notion further than others. Ramtha, for instance, says literally that you are God, and that consciousness and energy create the nature of reality. This is a philosophy that has a great attraction to many people, although most of us might draw the line at the presumption (and narcissism) of calling ourselves God. Just as questionable is the idea that one literally creates one's own reality. The contention is that there is no actual reality separate from one's thoughts. Everyone can agree that our thoughts are critical in the success or failure of our life's endeavors, and many even acknowledge that one's thoughts can affect the body's health and healing processes. Yet, this is different from stating that thoughts literally create reality. Taken to an extreme, it would mean that if you don't think it, it's not happening. Particularly if you are convinced you are God. There are more obviously attractive features to the philosophy, particularly when it coincides with the existentialist idea that there are no excuses in life. Most of us can appreciate that each of us is ultimately responsible for creating our world. Ditto a spirituality that emphasizes having the proper intention in all matters, and promoting Christ consciousness. But that is another topic altogether, and beyond the scope of this book. Our question is not whether or not someone likes the philosophy. Rather, we want to know how likely it is that extraterrestrial beings actually are being channeled? My personal conclusion is, not very. The statements that come to us purporting to be scientific have not found corroboration, or have been plainly disproven. And most of the statements, it has to be said, show little to no appreciation of science."

        "text_source": "The circles seem concerned with rebalancing our world-view and our sense of reality. In their own way, they are raising awareness of the fact that there is meaning as well as function behind creation, and that life and everything concerned with it has an innate purpose. No matter how you feel that the crop circles may have originated, they are bringing a richness and depth of inspiration to the fore. They 'en-soul' our world and breathe life and colour into the scientific machinery currently used to describe our universe. The circles seem to engender a view that such machinery is but the skeleton or bare bones of the universe, and that what we now need to understand is the flesh, the life-blood and heart of the wonderful creation around us. Is there more to this reality than we can currently see? A cursory glance over the rich legacy of legend and myth held by our world's many cultures suggests that there is far more to our reality than we currently acknowledge in our minds and hearts. The crop circles are our 'signs and wonders', our symbols and guides, our dreams and aspirations made manifest in the fields. They are a counterbalance to the mechanical and functional reality that the western world promulgates. They are mandalas of healing that have spread across the face of the earth; they are an unconscious expression of our need to re-order and reconsider. In our turbulent times, the human race is faced with many choices and many dilemmas, and is being asked to re-evaluate its attitudes towards numerous issues, especially war and the environment. Perhaps the crop circles are an outward sign that this process is firmly under way. Throughout this book we have looked at a whole gamut of components which may be behind the crop circles. We have looked at earth energies, pizo-electrical effects, magnetic effects and the link between vibration and the formation of shape. We have looked at the astonishing use of number symbolism encoded in the circles and what some of that might mean. There are many possibilities for the origins of the circles: earth spirits, extra-terrestrials, extra-dimensional intelligences, Gaia (the consciousness of the earth itself) or, of course, large-scale international hoaxing. Whoever the circle-makers are it is clear they prefer anonymity; it seems to me that they wish to be known by the quality of the fruits of their labour; the crop circles themselves. To be only interested in their identity, or the method by which the circles are made, seems somehow crude in comparison with the elegant and thoughtful works of art they put before us. The crop circles have resisted every attempt made to pin them down or explain them away, and after over fifteen years of being close to this phenomenon I have come respect that. There will always be people who are more interested in probing the circles scientifically, or those who want to spend their time with them building a case to prove or disprove the hoax theory. I am, however, content to sit, watch the the crop circles unfold and pay careful attention. The circles invite us on a journey of mutual exploration; I have the sense that neither side knows where it will end, but that the whole point of our interfacing is ultimately about the quality of the interaction. We began this book by searching for a state of focused openness, one in which we suspended our world-view in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the beautiful crop circles. I suggest that rather than giving up and grasping for any explanation of this amazing phenomenon, we strive to maintain our openness, and approach the circles with the patient attentiveness that their works of art so gracefully demand. Even if the mystery of the crop circles is never answered conclusively, they will leave an enduring impact on those who took the time to observe them. They will have changed forever their view of life and reality. And for those who may come long after the circles have disappeared, these pictures will serve as a snapshot of these difficult but hope-filled times."

        "text_source": "The largest and most powerful news media probably will be the last to wake up to the UFO reality they have been ignoring. The unfortunate effect of their intransigence has been to mislead the public and government representatives into thinking that nothing of any consequence has been observed (see section XI). Impact on Society  Opinion is divided on the vital question of humankind's ability to accept the reality of space visitors and get on with life without severe disruption of society. However, different assumptions can lead to different conclusions. If the visitors did not \"take over\" (in the sense of conquest and domination) and maintained a relatively low profile, their presence probably would not be severely disruptive. It all depends on \"what these guys want\" and what kind of relationship they want with us. Are they benign visitors who are merely curious and wish to communicate with us, or are they intrusive would-be residents or overlords who have their own agenda that conflicts with our own? An early scholarly opinion about what it all might mean was expressed by Yale University social scientist, Dr. Harold D. Lasswell: \"The implications of the unidentified flying objects (UFO) may be that we are already viewed with suspicion by more advanced civilizations and that our attempts to gain a foothold elsewhere [through space travel) may be rebuffed as a threat to other systems of public order. \"\u2022 The eminent psychologist and philosopher Carl G. Jung wrote fairly extensively about UFOs, including a book and letters to various UFO researchers, among them the author.' In regard to potential panic, he wrote (circa 1958), \"One does not faint with regard to the H-bomb.\" His implication was that at that time we were living with the reality of H-bombs over our heads, and we did not cower in fear or panic (although we did build bomb shelters). Yet, about a year later he wrote: \"[If UFOs should prove to be space visitors) we would find ourselves in the same critical position as primitive societies confronted with the superior culture of the white man. The reins of power would be taken from our hands .... Our spiritual progress would be hopelessly anticipated, and consequently paralyzed. And of course our science would immediately have to be put in the attic. \" A Brookings Institution report prepared for NASA and issued in December 1960, recommended that the world prepare itself for contact with extraterrestrial life. Such a discovery, author Donald N. Michael suggested, could stimulate an all-out effort to contact them, or could lead to sweeping changes in human civilization. He added: \"Societies sure of their own place have disintegrated when confronted by a superior society, and others have survived even though changed. Clearly, the better we understand the factors involved in responding to such crises the better prepared we may be.\" Sociologist Ron Westrum expressed concerns about the implications of ET contact for our society: I think in some respects UFOs could present us with a situation analogous to captivity or conquest, or even more closely, to a child's relation to an unpredictable parent. The temptation in such circumstances to become passive and autistic is very strong. One need only consider how contact with superior technology introduced benignly can be disastrous, to appreciate what such technology introduced indifferently or malignantly might do. Societies which pride themselves on their technical superiority and advancement (as ours does) would seem particularly vulnerable .... One should not be fooled by the trivial effects on our society which UFOs now exert. UFOs are a Protean force. It is wise to consider not just the actual, but also potential, behavior. What UFOs do now should not be taken as a given; it could too easily change. \u2022 Another sociologist who specializes in social psychology, Robert L. Hall, has stated that fear of mass panic or individual human overreaction to extraterrestrial contact is basically a \"popular myth\" not grounded in objective research. But the myth persists in journalistic circles and influences public policy considerations. It is very common that public authorities act on the assumption that the public is likely to behave foolishly and even destructively in the face of a threat, especially an ill-understood threat. In the so-called invasion from Mars panic [Orson Welles's infamous fictional radio broadcast about Martians landing in New jersey), the commonly held, though distorted, view of how people reacted is based on the most extreme reactions [rather than the full range of reactions) .... From a close study of collective behavior, my informed guess as to how most people would react to extraterrestrial contact is that they would seek more information, and they would engage in lots of discussion of the significance of the contact. If plenty of credible information is available, there is very little risk of any harmful or destructive behavior of the kind we might call panic.\u2022 Dr. Michael D. Swords, professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, has studied closely the history of the government's handling of UFO reports. 10 For a special report on government UFO policy he contributed the following remarks about the potential impact of UFOs on society: \"The revelation of an alien presence might drive us even closer together into a World Community ... the Earth is slowly heading this way anyway. ... My guess is that, being in a rather different technostate than the Amazonian Shaman [whose 'dreams' were taken away by contact with Western culture], we would swiftly 'create new dreams.' Religion would adjust. Catholicism and others already have. Galileo and Darwin were far greater challenges than ET.\" He went on to say that there are three interrelated problems associated with ET contact: ( 1) the unknown economic impact; (2) the subtle psychological impact of an alien presence whose objectives are unknown; and (3) the stronger psychological impact of alien abductions that contain both apparently negative elements and unknown objectives. These three could possibly feed off one another to create very negative social consequences, all founded on the awareness that the Government cannot control the phenomenon .... I believe that the economic concerns are a red herring .... I could imagine that the human race could adjust to the thought of covert, neutral (undamaging), alien observation in much the same way fish in a bowl might do, or, as we ourselves did living with the bomb. So the critical point is not, perhaps, alien covert presence, but 'abduction.' The point is that we in the human race have plenty of experience living with danger, threat, and death. Even in the worst-case alien scenario ... would not we respond, adjust, and go about our lives? Maj. john R. King, USAF, wrote a thesis on the UFO problem as part of his coursework for the Air Command and Staff College, Air University, examining the political and social implications of ET contact using alternative scenarios of hostility and benevolence. 12 Some of the political implications he foresaw were potential loss of confidence in government and in existing political parties and changes in national policies and international power relationships. \"One wonders if considerations such as outlined above have not been causing feelings of uneasiness in certain government quarters,\" he said. Among the potential sociological consequences he envisioned were: \u2022 Initial shock and consternation \u2022 Loss or reduction of ego \u2022 Modification of human values \u2022 Decrease in status of scientists \u2022 Reevaluation of religions \"[There could be) an almost infinite number of implications in economics, industry, the arts ... across the whole spectrum of human activity. The point is that we should be thinking about all these implications so that we can be better prepared for the day when we might be confronted with an overt approach on the part of extraterrestrials .... The gravity of the implications for mankind in the existence of UFOs may be the root cause for the puzzling official pronouncements and approach to the problem.\" Impact on Religion At least two surveys have been done on the question of contact with extraterrestrial life and its impact on religion. A study by Dennis P. Rosenbaum and Richard A. Maier involved a telephone survey of a random sample of 73 priests and ministers. The results strongly supported two hypotheses: (l) many denominations have not yet taken a position on the ET life issue; and (2) Christian religious fundamentalism is inversely related to belief in ET life. The authors concluded: \"[The results clearly imply that) if evidence supporting the existence of extraterrestrial life increases, religious individuals and institutions that hold tightly to the written words of the Bible will experience more dissonance and will have greater difficulty resolving the conflict than those who prefer a less fundamental interpretation of Scripture.\" A recent, more comprehensive, study by Victoria Alexander surveyed 1 ,000 randomly selected religious bodies in the continental United States!\" As summarized, the findings based on 230 respondents provide evidence to dispute \"the concept that religion would falter or collapse if confronted by the reality of advanced extraterrestrial life .... \" On a response scale ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree,\" the response to the first two key questions was as follows: \"Official confirmation of the discovery of an advanced technologically superior extraterrestrial civilization would have severe negative effects on the country's moral, social and religious foundations.\""

        "text_source": "With respects to Dr. Jacobs, this scenario strikes me as implausible. Over the years, there have been a few, sporadic, claims of encounters with hybrid beings. Every one of them points to the need of these beings for seclusion from human society. One instructive account is in the book, Raechel's Eyes. Raechel, an apparent hybrid, seemed to have tried to go so far as to take university classes and even have a roommate. Needless to say, she did not fit in, and also did not last long in the system. Assuming a breeding program is in fact happening, we should be cautious in developing conclusions on its purpose. It could be that it is simply to allow future generations of Grays or aliens to live on Earth more comfortably in some manner, not necessarily to integrate. Or, simply for them to acquire something of value in human DNA and continue to live in a separate world of their own. In any case, there is more than breeding going on. The Grays seem to be monitoring us actively. The implants, for example, point to a monitoring program, and it appears that many abductees are monitored throughout their lives. One of the key messages people report from the Grays is that they are concerned over humanity's destruction and poisoning of Earth's natural environment. Several abductees have reported that they are stationed here, and have been testing our water, soil, vegetation, and animal life for quite some time. If it is also true, as some evidence suggests, that the Grays have also taken animals from around the world, it could be to track changes to reproductive systems and therefore to the Earth's environment. The Grays often tell abductees what they are doing is necessary and important, even for the betterment or preservation of mankind or life on Earth. In particular, a number of abductees have reported the Grays are concerned about nuclear technology and weapons. Indeed, the message is that they are watching out for us. This is reasonable enough. If we humans arrived at another world and saw the most advanced species there in the process of destroying that planet's ecosystem, we too might be concerned. Still, we are not in a position to know if the Grays are truthful. There is nothing to stop them from lying to us. Is it impossible to think that humans would lie to natives of another planet in order to gain their trust for our own ulterior purposes, whatever those might be? Such a scenario was portrayed in James Cameron's movie, Avatar. The idea could be to convince the inhabitants that their planet is in danger and the newcomers want to help. The human race could not possibly be the first marks, the first suckers, in the history of the universe. We may ask, are the Grays evil? Putting aside the question of what would constitute interstellar evil, we suppose they might be, but this is probably the wrong way to look at the matter."

        "text_source": "Allow for the time being that there is little knowledge about the domain from which the alien beings-whatever they \"are\" or represent--derive; perhaps there are not even words or concepts to describe it. Yet acknowledge too that something is going on that cannot be dismissed out of hand. If, as appears now to be the case, no traditional explanation can be found, then we may be living in a vastly different universe from that which I, for one, was taught about at home and in school. This universe, the one that Western science has analyzed and categorized so successfully, consists of matter and energy, arranged exquisitely perhaps, but, devoid, as far as we can tell, of intelligence or intelligences that can be discovered by its methods. In this worldview the various spirit entities, God or gods and other mythic beings that peoples throughout the world, including in our own culture, experience as altogether real have no objective reality. They are the subject matter of psychology and psychopathology, anthropology, religious study, and science fiction, the projection outward of the perceptions and images of the brain. If we make these entities real, it is through metaphor and symbol, as poets do so well. To acknowledge that the universe (or universes) contains other beings that have been able to enter our world and affect us as powerfully as the alien entities seem able to do would require an expansion of our notions of reality that would all too radically undermine the Western scientific and philosophical ideology which Tulane philosopher Michael Zimmerman calls \"naturalistic humanism\" (Zimmerman 1993). The alien beings that appear to come to us from the sky in strange spacecraft present a particularly confusing challenge to such a naturalistic or objectivist ideology. For they seem to partake of properties belonging to both the spirit and the material worlds, bridging, as if effortlessly, the division between these realms which has become increasingly sacred and unbreachable since science and religion went their separate ways in the seventeenth century (Toulmin 1990). On the one hand these beings seem able to be seen by the abductees, who feel their bodies moved and find small lesions inflicted upon them. On the other hand the beings seem to come, like intermediaries from God or the Devil, from a nonembodied source, and they are able to open the consciousness of abductees to realms of being that do not exist in the physical world as we know it. Before concluding I will speculate about why the barrier between the spirit and material worlds has become so entrenched in the West. For it is this pos1 sibly false dichotomy that makes our confrontation with beings who do not respect this gulf so shocking. SPIRITUAL IMPLICATIONS I am often asked how experiences that are so traumatic, and even appear cruel at times, can also be spiritually transformative. To me there is no inconsistency here, unless one reserves spirituality for realms of the sublime that are free of pain and struggle. Sometimes our most useful spiritual learning and growth comes at the hands of rough teachers who have little respect for our conceits, psychological defenses, or established points of view. Zen Buddhist teaching is notorious for its shock treatment methods. One might even go further and argue that genuine spiritual growth is inevitably disturbing, as the boundaries of consciousness are breached and we are opened to new domains of existence. This does not, of course, \"forgive\" the cruelties associated with the abduction phenomenon. The alien beings that abductees speak about seem to many of them to come from another domain that is felt to be closer to the source of being or primary creation. They have been described, however homely their appearance, as intermediaries or emissaries from God, even as angels, by Carlos for one. The acknowledgment of their existence, after the initial ontological shock, is sometimes (see Peter 's and Catherine's cases, for exrunple) the first step in the opening of consciousness to a universe that is no longer simply material. Abductees come to appreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itself intelligent. They develop a sense of awe before a mysterious cosmos that becomes sacred and ensouled. The sense of separation from all the rest of creation breaks down and the experience of oneness becomes an essential aspect of the evolution of the abductee's consciousness, as Joe spoke of in relation to his own and his baby son's development. Joe felt the choice he was facing was, as he put it, between oneness and insanity. The aliens themselves may come to be seen as a split-off part of the abductee's soul or Self; his or herown reensoulment requires the integration of this separated dimension. Many abductees with whom I have worked, including several not written about in this book, experience a kind of ecstasy which, as in Carlos's case, can reach orgasmic proportions as they feel themselves open through their experiences (or the reliving of them) to a divine source or creative center of being in the cosmos. This source is, to the abductees, inexpressibly luminous and filled with color, and they may weep when they find themselves in its presence, for separation from it was painful beyond words. When they do open to the source once again, they may call the experience a \"return\" and protest once again having to fulfill even a newly agreed upon purpose as a human being."

        "text_source": "  Despite the numerous examples of aggressive and humiliating hybrid behavior, the existence of \"benign\" independent hybrid activity and the \"peaceful\" and even polite demeanor of the gray aliens have led some abductees and researchers to conclude that the abduction phenomenon is a positive force. This growing group has launched a crusade to convince the public that the entire alien agenda is benevolent, helpful, and spiritually uplifting. \"I see the ET visitors-the so-termed 'alien humanoids'-as friendly and with positive motivations and beneficial effects.\" So writes Dr. John Hunter Gray (fonnerly John Salter), professor of Indian Studies at the University of North Dakota, committed social activist, winner of the Martin Luther King award for civil rights work, and an abductee. Hunter Gray consciously remembered being abducted with his son in 1988. From the fragments he recalled of the event, he knew that kindly extraterrestrials were visiting Earth and that he was personally enhanced by their abduction of him. His view is typical of those of researchers and abductees who believe that aliens are benevolent beings who have come to Earth to help humans on both a personal and a societal level. Since the early 1980s the Positives have espoused the belief that humanity is fortunate to have been chosen for this beneficence. Influential Proponents  In addition to John Hunter Gray, there are several other Positive proponents who have shaped a segment of public opinion about the meaning of abductions and the aliens' ultimate intentions. One of the first to champion the idea that aliens are on Earth for our benefit was University of Wyoming professor of Guidance and Counseling Leo Sprinkle. An early pioneer in abduction research, beginning hypnosis in the mid-1960s, Sprinkle concluded that the simple explanation that beings come to Earth for their own purposes was insufficient. Eventually Sprinkle developed the rationale that \"there are two themes to the ET [extraterrestrial] purpose; 1, ETs are here to rejuvenate planet earth and 2, ETs are here to assist humankind in another stage of evolution.\" The ETs' method of showing mankind that they are here to help us, he explained, is \"through a metamorphosis of human consciousness.\"! The metamorphosis takes place, in part, through the lessons that wise aliens teach humans about cosmic matters. The aliens often communicate these lesson through channeling. In the course of his research, Sprinkle came to realize that he himself is an abductee. In 1980, Sprinkle held the first of his annual conferences in Laramie, Wyoming, which has become a central meeting place for followers of the Positive point of view. At the conferences, Sprinkle often takes questions from concerned individuals about abductions or sightings and \"channels\" the meaning of the person's event, directly asking the aliens questions and relating the answers. This total acceptance of the spirituality of the abduction phenomenon has made him popular with many abductees and researchers influenced by New Age thought. Another proponent of Positive themes is Richard Boylan, a former private practice psychologist in Sacramento, California, and also an abductee. Like Hunter Gray and Sprinkle, Boylan interprets his abduction experiences as profoundly benevolent and beneficial for him. His aliens are environmentally minded creatures who want to raise people's consciousness about Earth's problems and humanity's place in the cosmos. According to Boylan, the \"mission\" of the aliens \"is to communicate to humans the concerns the ETs share-concerns about our violence toward each other and our government's violence toward them; about the ecological destruction and degradation we are visiting upon our earth; about our failure to properly care for and educate each child; about our possession of, and intended use of, nuclear weapons as a way to resolve disputes; and about our becoming more conscious of our heritage and our destiny (which both involve the ETs).\" Boylan believes that the aliens will reveal themselves eventually, and at that time a \"conditioned\" humanity will not be afraid. When the great event comes, we will welcome the friendly aliens with open arms as we join with them in universal fellowship. We look forward as some of the implications of ET-human relationships develop when we finally get to CEIV [Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind-that is, abductions], the open, official, mutually welcomed, meeting of our earth's representatives with the representatives of these other star civilizations, and then we finally have a truly multiracial world, racial in its true sense of races from other planets since we are only one human race with different colors and bone structures and so forth.... If we get rid of our nuclear weapons and our gun-slinging attitude towards solving problems by outdrawing the other guy, then we will be ready for admission into the intergalactic UN, if you will. We can look forward to cultural exchanges or representatives from earth and other civilizations because they have other things to learn from us just as we have other things to learn from them and this may involve the actual exchange of people going to other planets to observe their society and their representatives here walking among us. To Boylan, the aliens are even more acceptable because they believe in a form of Supreme Being and therefore confirm Judeo-Christian monotheism: \"The ETs, too, realize that there's a Supreme Being or a supreme source of everything. They're not kidded that they are the top of the pile either. They acknowledge a supreme source out there-the fountainhead of all life. \" A significant influence on the Positives' belief system has been Massachusetts researcher Joseph Nyman, who began hypnotic regressions of abductees in the late 1980s and added \"past lives\" to the Positives' vision. When he regressed them to early childhood to recover the first abduction memories, he found he could take some of his subjects back to when they were infants, then back to the womb, and then to a \"past life.\" A few of them \"remembered\" that they had lived their past lives as aliens. Nyman hypothesized that abductees were taken from the time they were babies because they already had existed as aliens in past lives. Not only does Nyman find that many abductees think they were aliens in a past life, but he also suggests that some abductees possess an alien's \"consciousness,\" which imbues their present human form. For Nyman, the evidence is \"overwhelming\" that the aliens impose these dual feelings-human and alien-on the abductees. \"It implies the taking up of residence in the human form at birth (or before) of a fully developed intelligence which for a while is aware ' of both its human and non-human nature and of the prearranged monitoring to be conducted throughout life.\" Abductees and aliens have \"melded\" together in some way and in a sense abductees and aliens are the same. Abductees live their present lives with a \"dual reference,\" human and alien.6This allows the abductee to feel a positive connectiveness to the aliens with a resultant loss of \"fear, anxiety, and self-doubt.\" Perhaps the most significant spokesperson for the Positive viewpoint is John Mack of Harvard University. As Mack examined the established structure of abductions, he concluded that the aliens' goal was more than administering clinical procedures. Although Mack says the abduction phenomenon is \"mixed\" and not entirely positive, he believes abductions bring an opportunity for spiritual transformation and heightened consciousness. Mack has been influenced by psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who postulated that the human mind could connect with the \"collective unconscious,\" the universe, and all things animate and inanimate, present and past. Similarly, Mack believes that the abduction phenomenon has the potential, like Eastern metaphysical philosophies, to \"depict the universe and all its realities as a vast play of consciousness with physical manifestations.\" The effect of abductions can be \"personal growth,\" which results in \"an intense concern for the planet's survival and a powerful ecological consciousness.\" In addition. Mack thinks that Western society has cut itself off from \"awareness of any higher form of intelligence\" in the universe. In his view, the aliens have predicted the destruction of Earth by the encroachment of \"technodestructive and fear-driven acquisitiveness,\" and he suggests that the aliens may be using the hybridization program and visualizations of our self-destruction to bring about the healing of Earth and \"the further evolution of consciousness.\"\" Within this framework, Mack began hypnotic regression of abductees in 1990, hoping to \"push past\" their trauma and unveil the essential goodness of the alien higher consciousness. And like Nyman, he found that a number of abductees whom he hypnotized had lived past lives, sometimes as aliens. Mack concluded that even though most other abduction researchers have not found the past-life-as-alien account, Nyman's \"dual reference\" was a \"fundamental dimension of the consciousness expansion or opening that is an intrinsic aspect of the abduction phenomenon itself.\" As a credentialed Harvard faculty member with entree into mainstream intellectual life, Mack became an intellectually courageous and powerful advocate for the abduction phenomenon. Where he deviates from the mainstream is in his belief that the phenomenon transcends conventional ideas about the nature of reality. For Mack, understanding reality requires consciousness expansion that goes beyond traditional science. And such consciousness expansion can only be good for humanity. A growing number of abductees who are not abduction researchers have also found their experiences spiritually uplifting and transforming. At an abduction conference held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, abductee \"Susan\" explained that the \"communication\" she receives from \"the alien 'guardians' of our planet offers insight and wisdom to a world in need of it. It contains a message of love and support to a planet in need of healing.\" She also found personal benefit in the experience: \"Since my experience, I rejoice in being who I am, with no expectations of how I should be, and complete acceptance of who I am. The changes in me are staggering. My life works as if by magic... . Although at one time I thought 'Why me?' now I say \"Thank you for choosing me. '\"l 1  Abductee Leah Haley, who related her experiences in her book Lost Was the Key, believes that members of the American military- somehow in conjunction with the aliens-abducted her on many occasions and held her in a barrackslike building. Yet despite these clearly negative experiences, her view of the aliens is positive. In her children's book, Ceto's New Friends, Haley tells the story of the gray alien Ceto who comes to Earth and meets little Annie and Seth. The three play together, and Ceto invites them on board his UFO. They are happy to go, float up into the object, play various \"games,\" and then are floated back. On the final page, the two happy but weary children look longingly toward the UFO, and the story concludes with Haley writing that \"the Spaceship flew away, but Ceto will come back soon to visit his new friends on Earth.\" 12 Although most abductees have not gone as far as this in \"humanizing\" and sentimentalizing the aliens, Haley's viewpoint is a logical extension of the desire- perhaps the need-for the aliens to be friendly and helpful. Taken as a group, the Positives' message is that humans have conducted their affairs in a way that will lead to the degradation of the planet and the end of the human species. Humans have caused poverty, ignorance, and overpopulation, and they risk environmental catastrophe and atomic annihilation. The concerned aliens are \"educating\" abductees to warn us of what is to come if we do not change our behavior. The Positives argue that aliens are more fully evolved spiritually than humans, and that they have a heightened awareness of the mysteries of the universe. The aliens recognize the specialness of human life and are also aware of how humankind has erred. They respect the sanctity of human life even more than we do. They care about us and love us. The aliens are the teachers and we are the students. They are the parents and we are the children. They must teach us how to behave. Because they are a benevolent species, they have come to help us find solutions to our problems. Moreover, the Positives believe that alien guidance is not meant only for society in general. The aliens can help the individual ab-ductee to raise himself spiritually by giving him knowledge of higher realms of existence and the connectedness of all things. They can also aid individual abductees physically by curing various problems that they may have. John Hunter Gray was a recipient of alien largess. His body hair increased, his face and neck narrowed, many wri nk les and blemishes disappeared from his face, and his circulation and blood-clotting improved. He has not been ill since the abduction, and after forty years of smoking, he gave it up with no signs of nicotine withdrawal. He also has had expanded psychic abilities. 13 Hunter Gray is convinced that the aliens treat all people with the same kindness and respect that he received."

        "text_source": "Finally, many if not most of the abductees with whom I have worked intensively come to feel that their enhanced spiritual awareness must be translated into some sort of teaching or higher purpose. Some may be saddened, and even become hopeless about the ecology of the planet and the fate of the earth's lifeforms. Yet they may feel that their experiences are, ultimately, about preserving life and that they must do something toward this end. Ed, Joe, Jerry, Eva, Peter, Sara, Arthur, and others each feel that they have a particular mission or responsibility to teach a different sort of consciousness concerning the human place on Earth. Some, like Peter, Ed, and Eva, have even changed their jobs or are seeking to shift the direction of their work in order to better fulfill their life's new purpose. Peter envisions a future \"Golden Age\" of learning and opportunity, which he hopes to help bring about. IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN IDENTITY Each abductee experiences in some sense an expansion of his or her sense of self, of identity in the world. Paul wondered how we had come to mistake the \"shell\" of our being for the \"whole\" of it; and Eva, in her recall of the Soul Bird story of her childhood, recognized there were compartments of self which she was opening up and merging in order to move from fragmentation toward wholeness. The change that abductees experience is fundamentally that they may no longer feel themselves to be separate from other beings. They shed their identification with a narrow social role and gain a sense of oneness with all creation, a kind of universal connectedness. This opening to a wider identity appears to be a direct result of the abduction experiences, if not a central aspect of the whole process. The change appears to be the result of two related elements. The abduction experiences themselves shatter the illusion of our control, and demonstrate forcefully \ufffdhat we are helpless in the face of forces and beings whose purpose we do not understand. Each abductee discovers that he or she is but one intelligent being in a universe populated with various other entities that are not \"supposed to\" exist. Human beings are not lords of the earth, they realize, but children of the cosmos who must find their way to live in harmony with all manner of creatures on the earth and elsewhere. This is a terrifying lesson in humility that opens the psyche to a wider perception of the universe, including the beings and entities that inhabit it. At the same time, as I noted, some abductees become open to the presence of a divine source, which fills their being and gives a sense of connection with a universal consciousness from which they have come and to which they will return. \"Past life\" experiences, which seem to extend the sense of self over time in both embodied and unembodied form, create a further expansion of the feeling of what it is to be a human being. Finally, the peculiar sense that many abductees gain during the relaxation sessions that they have a dual huf!lan/alien identity reinforces all of the above processes . For the alien self is felt to be a kind of missing part, a soul link to the universal source of consciousness, the anima mundi from which they feel they have been cut off.PoLITICAL, EcoNOMIC, AND RELIGious IMPLICATIONS The Western scientific/materialist worldview has been hugely successful in its explorations of the physical world, revealing many of its secrets and using this knowledge to serve human purposes. We have overcome the harshness of winter, reduced suffering through advances in medicine, and learned to communicate electronically with those who are far away. At the same time we have applied our knowledge to creating weapons of destruction that can now easily destroy life as we know it. Our use of modern technology to tear resources from the earth is bringing the biosphere to the brink of collapse. We are a species out of harmony with nature, gone berserk in the indulgence of its desires at the expense of other living beings and the earth that has given us life. The task of reversing this trend is momentous. Even as we recognize the peril we have created, the vested interests that stand in the way of discovering a balance in our relationship with nature are formidable. Huge \u00b7corporate, scientific, educational, and military institutions consume many billions of dollars of material goods and maintain, as if mindlessly, a paralyzing stasis that is difficult to reverse. For international business the world seems at times to be nothing more than a giant market to be divided up among the cleverest entrepreneurs."

He speculates broadly: Or should we hypothesize that an advanced race somewhere in the universe and sometime in the future has been showing us three-dimensional space operas for the last two thousand years, in an attempt to guide our civilization? If so; do they deserve our congratulations? . . . Are we dealing instead with a parallel universe, another dimension, where there are human races living, and where we may go at our expense, never to return to the present? Are these races only semihuman, so that in order to maintain contact with us, they need cross-breeding with men and women of our planet? Is this the origin of the many tales and legends where genetics plays a great role: the symbolism of the Virgin in occultism and religion, the fairy tales involving human midwives and changelings, the sexual overtones of the flying saucer reports, the biblical stories of intermarriage between the Lord's angels and terrestrial women, whose offspring were giants? From that mysterious universe, are higher beings projecting obj ects that can materialize and dematerialize at will? Are the UFOs \"windows\" rather than \"objects\"? There is nothing to support these assumptions, and yet, in view of the historical continuity of the phenomenon, alternatives are hard to find, unless we deny the reality of all the facts, as our peace of mind would indeed prefer ( 1988, p. 143-44 ). Where facts are lean, inconsistent, or disparate, human beings, \u00b7Vallee assures us, are quick to fin\u00b7 in the gaps. \"Because many observations of UFO phenomena appear self -consistent and at the same time irreconcilable with scientific knowledge, a logical vacuum has been created that human imagination tries to fill with fantasy\" ( 1988, p. 1 45). Ultimately, Vallee prescribes our remaining open to learning from phenomena that we do not yet understand. 'These unexplained observations need not represent a visitation from space visitors, but something even more interesting: a window toward undiscovered dimensions of our environment\" (1988, p. 203). \"I believe that the UFO phenomenon represents evidence for other dimensions beyond spacetime; the UFOs may not come from ordinary space, but from a multiverse which is all around us, and of which we have stubbornly refused to consider the disturbing reality in spite of the evidence available to us for centuries\" ( 1988, p. 253)."

        "text_source": "Furthermore, for most abductees the hybridization has occurred simultaneously with an enlightenment imparted by the alien beings that has brought home forcibly to them the failure of the human experiment in its present form. Abduction experiencers come to feel deeply that the death of human beings and countless other species will occur on a vast scale if we continue on our present course and that some sort of new life-form must evolve if the hurman biological and spiritual essence is to be preserved. They do not generally question why the maintenance of human life must take such an odd form. I ask abductees repeatedly to explain to me why, if these hybrid beings are to represent the species that will repopulate our planet after the prophesied environmental holocaust, they appear so listless and frail on the ships, hardly vital stock to perpetuate the human or any other race. Only Peter has offered an answer by insisting that to him the hybrids do not appear listless, but have a vitality of their own. Jerry in a recent abduction has seen quite beautiful, angel-like, young adult hybrids with porcelain skin; their function was to show her on a screen the earth's inevitable future if the present course is not changed. For me the future role that the hybrid offspring are being prepared to play represents one of the most puzzling aspects of the entire abduction phenomenon. Those investigators who perceive the UFO abduction phenomenon from an adversarial perspective tend to interpret its meaning one-sidedly. The aliens are using us, the argument goes, for their own purposes, replenishing their genetic stock at our expense after some sort of holocaust on their own planet. If they make us feel that there is something worthwhile about the whole process, this is the result of deception. I would not say that the aliens never resort to deception to hide their purposes, but the above argument is, in my view, too narrow or linear an interpretation. My own impression is that we may be witnessing something far more complex, namely an awkward joining of two species, engineered by an intelligence we are unable to fathom, for a purpose, that serves both of our goals with difficulties for each. I base this view on the evidence presented by the abductees themselves. First, many abductees, for example, Scott and Peter, become aware in the course of our work that the alien/human union serves the reciprocal needs of each species, completing aspects of the identity of each that are missing or have been lost in the course 1 of evolution. Roughly speaking, the abductees experience the aliens as having remained less densely embodied and closer to the creative source in the universe from which human beings have been cut off. Through their interaction with the abductees they bring them (and all of us potentially) closer to our spiritual cosmic roots, return us to the divine light or \"Home,\" a \"place\" (really a state of being) where secrets, jealousy, greed, and destructiveness have no purpose. The aliens, on the other hand, as perceived by the experiencers, long to enjoy the intense emotionality that comes with our full embodiment. They are fascinated with our sensuality, our warmth, our capacity for eroticism, and deep parental affection, and they seem to respond to openhearted love."

        "text_source": "Others argue that it could well be a situation comparable to a small child being grabbed up and taken to a hospital, where efficient medical personnel operate on her in a coolly professional manner. The child is terrified and does not understand what is happening, while the ones operating treat her as a patient to be processed. Such an attitude, born of repetition and weariness, can be found in emergency rooms all over the country. Pacheco and Blann claimed that due to the combination of widespread paranormal phenomena with current geophysical and political events, mankind must be entering the biblical end times: Perhaps not the 'end of the world' in a physical sense, but at least the end of the current phase of human existence. They went on to conclude that our society is in the midst of a concerted campaign of deception being promoted by certain individuals who are themselves under deception by 'consciousness' that inhabits the twilight world between the real and the surreal-similar to what Carl Jung called 'archetypes of a collective consciousness,' and what religions call angelic beings. In other words, we are all involved in the age-old battle between good and evil, God versus Satan. Some of these manifestations are constructive, respect our free will, and assist us in our path toward ultimate good, or God. These are the angelic phenomena typified by 'messengers of God' and true apparitions of the Virgin Mary, they wrote. Others are summarily evil, and attempt either to seduce us through seemingly 'good' manifestations, or force us to adopt a false belief, while undermining our rational thought processes and our human spirit. These are primarily the manifestations reported as UFOs. This summation is supported by many religious writers, including John Weldon, who, along with Hebrew Christian author and lecturer Zola Levitt, warned, It is perfectly reasonable, from a Biblical point of view, to expect that the UFOs represent demon activity. Contact with them will grieve God ... and He will remonstrate with man in a disastrous way. Author Dr. Clifford Wilson, who attacked the ancient astronaut theories of von D\u00e4niken on biblical grounds, made clear his belief that UFOs have no connection to God. He wrote, To argue that God's heavenly messengers need UFOs to achieve His purposes is to limit God's powers, and his thoughts, to those of men. Much of the modern writing about UFOs and the Bible tends to think of God as little more than a glorified astronaut.... The physical principles by which UFOs operate might well be utilized for the purposes of God, but the Bible certainly does not confine Almighty God to a heavenly 'super-car.' The fact is, this is serious. The aliens are here, he added. We say, not from other planets. Not from outer space. Not just from the innermost depths of human reality. We say the answer is paraphysical and that the author of terror (Satan) is himself the perpetrator of these phenomena. Paul Davies, author of The Mind of God and Are We Alone?, explained the anxiety of religious fundamentalism concerning nonhuman intelligent life thusly: Belief that mankind has a special relationship with God is central to the monotheistic religions. The existence of alien beings, especially if they were further advanced than humans intellectually and spiritually, would disrupt this cozy view. Pacheco and Blann offered this formula for dealing with nonhuman intelligences. Although we claim that there are both good and evil manifestations, we are not able to tell the difference in any systematic or definitive way. . . . Therefore, one could argue that the best approach is to avoid any such manifestations. As every Christian fundamentalist has been taught, Satan is the Great Deceiver. The New Testament book 2 Corinthians 11:14 (Revised Standard) states, . . . for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Those who look upon such phenomena as the UFOs, contactees and the occult as benevolent are playing into his hands, wrote Weldon and Levitt. Since the UFO researcher is told that from the human perspective he cannot separate angels from demons posing as helpers, he is trapped in a spiritual hall of mirrors just as confusing as the one erected about UFOs by government deceit and disinformation. Small wonder that so many people choose to ignore the UFO phenomenon rather than deal with all its ramifications. The problem is even more acute for those who have experienced a UFO sighting or an abduction firsthand. Some are awed and excited by their experience, such as Lyn Buchanan, who said he almost accepted an offer to become a UFO pilot. Others are frightened and disoriented, such as Travis Walton. They [UFO visitors] respond to what you give out to them, explained author and abductee Whitley Strieber in a recent interview. If you look at the experience with fear, it will be fearful. They are projecting their subjective reality to us and we are projecting our subjective reality to them. They spent ten years playing games with my fears. Strieber said he has noticed that negative UFO experiences tend to increase around military bases, where fear of attack and infiltration is most intense. This thesis seems to have been true for the military-trained remote viewers, who voluntarily chose to take a mental look at UFO occupants and had confidence in their RV expertise. None of them apparently have suffered any ill effects simply from viewing what they perceived as alien races. But while religious fundamentalists may have trouble dealing with the concept of aliens as opposed to angels and demons, many clerics voice a certain equanimity when it comes to the idea of life outside the earth. Speaking in reaction to the discovery of the meteorite said to contain fossils of ancient Martian life, the Reverend James A. Wiseman, chairman of the Department of Theology at Catholic University, said, Personally, I've always believed we will find life on other planets. He said those whose faith might be shaken by aliens are those who believe God created life on Earth and Earth alone. He added that changing such an egocentric and ethnocentric mind-set might require a massive shift in beliefs comparable to Copernicus persuading the public that the earth actually revolved around the sun. What this challenges, interestingly enough, is not classical Christian and Jewish theism, which has always known that everything that is, is God's creation, stated Stanley Hauerwas, professor of theological ethics at Duke University Divinity School. It challenges the high humanism that has been characteristic of our lives since the 17th century, namely that the human species is what it's all about, that everything exists to serve us. James Leo Garrett, a professor at the conservative Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, did not exclude the possibility of extraterrestrial life. We need to be cautious saying that life on other planets is precluded, because [the Bible] also says that God is the creator of all, he said. New York's Jewish Theological Seminary professor Burton Visotzky remarked that the stories of creatures, spirits, demons, and angels down through history suggests that nonhuman beings might exist. He indicated that rabbinical tradition has accepted such a possibility since the fourth century. Fathi Osman, a retired professor of Islamic studies at the University of Southern California, provided a quote from the Koran that seems to indicate that God created life outside of Earth. He pointed to Surah 42:29, which reads, And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the Earth. And the living creatures that He has scattered through them. And He has power to gather them together when He wills. While the debate over the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life continues, more and more people are claiming to have made contact with beings from beyond, and recent scientific discoveries have brought new knowledge that lends support to the concepts offered in metaphysical messages."

The problem is that their sun is dying and their planet has begun to cool. \"The aliens have decided their only way to survive is to migrate to another world that would have an environment similar to their own planet,\" Smith was supposedly told. \"Our planet represents the one opportunity for their civilization to endure. The problem for mankind is that we're living here.'' Smith's source went on to explain that-not surprisingly-it would be impossible for our civilization to absorb immigrants from another planet. \"The social turmoil would be beyond comprehension. The economic chaos that would come about would destroy the foundations of our lives,\" Smith was told. The CIA has ostensibly obtained data showing that the UFOs have conducted a systematic plan of surveillance, beginning with collecting plant and animal specimens, then establishing contact at random with humans. \"Currently, they are embarked on a biological study of people to determine how we differ,\" the informant volunteered. \"They're determining whether our two races can interbreed and, if so, what the mutant will look like, its genetic composition, and so forth. . . . We also know they've tested our defenses to see if we can withstand an invasion. Therefore, at some time in the future, we expect UFOs to become increasingly hostile.\" Smith wanted to know if the world's governments know about this alarming situation. \"Some do,\" he was told. \"Others are on a need to know basis. We've maintained secrecy because the truth might destroy us.\" Why then was Smith given this information? \"It doesn't have the official stamp,\" was the reply. \"You're not the only person who is receiving information. A slow, gradual release of the facts will prevent panic.\" Smith asked about the wilder tales of encounters with UFOs. \"Some of those come from our government attempting to confuse the facts,' the informant said. \"Many of the reports are being created by the aliens to achieve the same ends. The past several years has produced some incredibly wild contactee reports. We believe the extraterrestrials are testing our ability to withstand psychological warfare. To date, the people selected haven't done too well in that respect.\" The official added that he expected an increase in bizarre contactee cases such as those where witnesses have been approached by UFOs and then had their memories erased. (Since this conversation took place in the early 1970s there has indeed been an increase in such cases.) \"We know there's a purpose behind their actions and the end result may not be for the betterment of humanity,\" he said. \"Can we believe the CIA story?\" asks Warren Smith. \"Or is this another of the agency's efforts to confuse the facts in ufology?\""

        "text_source": "While continuing to toe the line, a note he sent me in March 2007 was encouraging: Hi, good friend! Never, never, ever give up. . . .  A TIGHT LID The U.S. government and the British have made secret treaty agreements with the aliens in exchange for technology and so-called 'recon' missions during times of human conflict, claims an anonymous three-star general. The aliens have basically agreed not to concern themselves with the wars or conflicts of humans-'not to interfere' in society. Let the governments rule and decide. Exactly what the aliens get in return was not exactly made clear or available. Also, there are special 'teams' which eradicate, discredit, harass,  and  'trump up charges'  to  control  humans  who  experience  any visitations from aliens, or make verifiable UFO sightings. This is one of the reasons I retired. . . .  William J. Pawelec, the former U.S. Air Force computer operations and programing specialist cited in Chapter 14, confirms some of the above. I would say this is international in scope, he told Steven Greer of the Disclosure Project, in an interview that Pawelec had specified not to be released until December 2010:  The projects that we have are closely tied in with other allies' governments. In fact, I have been told back in the late 1970s, on one of the early classified projects I worked on . . . that there was a secret agreement between us and the Brits, so whatever we invent, they get. And there is no limitation as to what it is. The Brits can make their duplicates, and we don't hold back on any of the technology, because of that secret agreement that was cut during World War II. And we have other allies like that. I believe that what we see also is a lot of cross-pollination of scientists from different countries working on projects even in the most classified arenas in the United States. Pawelec  also  hinted  that  certain  British  commando  units  liaise  with their American counterparts on the problem (as for example in the 1971/72 incident described earlier by Harold Varnam). All these black projects were highly classified. What concerns me, he continued, is when these projects go 'beyond black'; people with ulterior motives that have gotten in control of these projects and/or the funding for them, and/or the ability of what really is scary, to write their own unlimited checks with no recourse to anybody. They're not even a budget item any more. They literally authorize the Treasury to cut them checks [and] it becomes evident that they have agendas that are independent of the goals of the United States. And the attitude is seemingly one of control-power and control. The ability of certain forces out there to use force whenever absolutely necessary,  or  other  controlling  mechanism  to  ameliorate  the  danger  of a leak, or maintain secrecy with fear, is always there. If they can do one high-profile hit on somebody in a specific way, what it does is put the fear of God into those that they want to continue to control, so that they don't say anything out of turn-they don't probe where they shouldn't probe, like Congressman Steven Schiff was doing. . . .  My concerns are for the freedom of our country-and of the free world. It sounds rather simplistic, but we have a philosophy upon which we base our lives, and my philosophy is the republican form of government-if we can get back to it in some way, shape or form-[which] is the strongest form of government developed by man. If we don't find ways to neutralize these negative forces, we're going to find our lifestyles-our concepts of life as a species-nullified. As Dwight D. Eisenhower had warned in his farewell speech as president in January 1961: In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. . . . That scenario of a satellite government has long since arrived. In their book  A.D.  After  Disclosure,  Richard  Dolan  and  Bryce  Zabel  refer  to  it as  The  Breakaway  Group. Bolstered  by  tremendous  co-opted  assets worldwide, they claim, they have over the years gained tremendous independence from the established political and military authorities.

Asked the purpose of the briefing, this highly placed man, who went on to become a cabinet secretary, said, 'There is intelligent life in the universe. It's here. And I've seen it. . . .' The cabinet secretary told the family friend that aliens were just the 'tip of the iceberg' in terms of mind-blowing revelations."

By now, everyone understands that the long-term future of our species, and our world, cannot include oil as our main source of energy. It pollutes horribly and harms life on Earth. A better, cleaner, more abundant source of energy would surely be more desirable, except from the point of view of those people who own the oil industry, some of the most powerful people in the world. For generations, they have monetized oil. What if the source of energy behind UFOs is impossible to centralize, and therefore harder to exploit for money? Aside from that, oil is the foundation of our world. Even under the most ideal conditions, transitioning out of an oil-dominated world would have a volatile effect on the global stock market and economic system. After all, most of the value of any consumer product is determined by the amount of energy that went into making and transporting it. Generally, that means oil. Therefore, if we say nothing else, we can conclude that the UFO phenomenon poses a threat to the established economic order: specifically to those wealthiest people and groups that own the greatest shares in the petroleum industry, and in general to the financial markets that would be shaken by the end of the oil era. Religious Implications   What would the admission of a UFO reality do to religion? Would it mean anything at all? The answer is yes, it would certainly mean something. Of course, the world has many different religions, so everything would depend on which one we mean. Still, to the extent that any religion deals with the creation of the world, the creation of mankind, and to the extent to which people today continue to believe in versions of those accounts, the UFO phenomenon has profound implications. This will be especially evident after we review the history of ancient UFOs, or ancient aliens, in the next chapter. Because, if it appears that they have been with us for a long time, many people will inevitably wonder if they were the gods of ancient times, or even God himself? It doesn't take an excess of imagination to see things in this way when reviewing the Hebrew Scriptures, for instance. Time and again, the God of the Israelites directly intervened to save the day, and had a very personal relationship with Moses. Other parts of that collection are also suggestive of aliens and their technology. The vision of Ezekiel comes to mind, in which the prophet beheld a wondrous apparition of angels in a flaming chariot in the sky. When you consider the ideas of the various ancient alien theorists, we naturally ask whether beings from elsewhere became our so-called gods and were instrumental in creating human religions. For practicing Christians, probably the most sensitive question would be: was Christ an extraterrestrial? What would it mean if he had been?"

Their intervention in the rush of human events might be a positive step toward solving the problems of disease, the environment, and war. However, at this time the evidence of benevolent intentions is, at best, ambiguous. One thing is certain: Most abductees say the phenomenon has had a devastating effect on their personal lives. Many have phobias, scars, bruises, and physical problems, especially gynecological and urological dysfunction. Many live in fear that it will happen again and feel guilty that they cannot protect their children. The debate over alien intentions again brings up the question of what is believable in abduction research. Hypnosis, consciously recalled memories, false memories-is there a way of separating the \"signal from the noise\"? Uncovering the reality of abduction events is difficult but feasible. Methodological rigor has developed a core of solid information, confirmed by hundreds of abductees, and it has enabled investigators to understand the abduction phenomenon. Alien intentions, an area that could not be addressed from an evidentiary standpoint in the past, depends on the aliens' ultimate goals. Their intentions are linked to the end of their program and can be narrowed down to three possibilities: Their actions are mutually beneficial to both the aliens and humans; they are beneficial to the aliens and intentionally harmful to humans; or they are beneficial to the aliens who simply do not care what human consequences their actions might have. Is there any way to discern what the outcome will be? Our present state of knowledge has finally allowed us to understand what most probably will happen in the future when the aliens' goals and intentions will be made evident. We do not yet have all the pieces to the puzzle but the outlines are well-defined and the picture is clearly recognizable. It is not a picture that I enjoy looking at."

        "text_source": "Another well known author, Alan Alford, in his latest book, Gods of the New Millennium, has stated his belief that the Annunaki, through gene splicing, have induced longevity and may be poised to make yet more genetic alterations to their wayward, earth-laboratory creations. In addition he has taken Sitchin's work one step further by stating that the recently found bible-code may predict world events simply due to the fact that our makers continue to manipulate the fate of mankind. What better way to make a book predict the future successfully than by actually manipulating events to conform to the text? Alford also states that according to his research, based on the Sumerian findings, 184,000 years ago homo sapiens suddenly emerged from homo erectus. He goes on to say that our species took a remarkable leap forward in a very short span of time. During this leap we acquired a 50% increase in brain size, language capability, and a completely changed modern anatomy. It is not surprising then that Alford is receiving support from such notables as Dr. Johannes Fiebag, of Bad Neustadt, Germany, credited with having coined the term paleo-SETI studies. Fiebag drew attention in a recent paper to the early discovery, by scientists working on the Genome Project, that the majority of human DNA appears to have no real function, but is, in the words of evolutionary biologist Robert Shapiro, trash, nonsense, or litter. Fiebag contends that this litter could well be important information about the structural code or a genetic language not yet recognized as such. He goes on to speculate, that if extraterrestrial intelligences have carried out the manipulation of our DNA in the distant past hints of such an event would have to be found precisely here, in this so called litter. Could this be the purpose behind our modern abduction phenomenon? Is it possible that our consciousness is being expanded at such a phenomenal rate that now we are becoming aware of the abduction event itself? I have been in private practice for over 33 years and during that time I have seen changes in the development of my child-patients that are rather astounding. It is my opinion that one of the primary examples of human change is illustrated by these children born within the last 10 years. I believe any mother who looks at her recently born child and compares it with children born over 20 years ago will testify that there is a tremendous difference. Today's babies are acutely aware of their surroundings the very second they are born. They instantly look about the delivery room and appear to be aware of those who are present. They instantly know and recognize their mother and in addition are acutely aware of others who are present. In recent years there has been a notable lack of medical discussion in reference to exactly what a baby is able to see at birth. Thirty years ago there was much discussion on this subject within the opthalmological community. There were numerous diverse opinions. Some opted for them seeing only greyish figures; others thought they couldn't focus acutely enough to discern shapes or figures at all. Others held that newborn babies were able to see but could only discern black and white. This is a far cry from what we realize a newborn sees today. Recently there has been a great deal of attention drawn to communication with the baby. There also has been a system of sign language developed and it appears to prove that a baby can actually communicate. There are those who look upon the great differences in the new human and say the reasons have to do with better prenatal care, improved health of the mother, communication between the mother and the fetus or what the mother was exposed to on TV. In my opinion this supposition is nonsense and in light of my recent studies and exposure to the alien abduction phenomenon, I have come to the conclusion the rapid advancement of the human species is due to alien intervention with our bodies and minds. UFO researcher Robert O. Dean has spoken many times of the development of a new humanity called Homo Noeticus. This was a term actually coined by the noted author, John White, who has been doing research in parapsychology and noetics, the study of consciousness for many years. Another new fascinating aspect of this subject has to do with the ability of modern babies to actually read written print. This was the subject of a recent ABC television broadcast which demonstrated the associated techniques used to reach this conclusion. In another experiment, sign language was used to communicate with toddlers not old enough to speak. We may see this practice develop early reading skills of the child. The expansion of the modern child's consciousness may be demonstrated in many ways. Quite often, a four- or five-year-old will seem to reach into what may be termed the universal pool of thought or knowledge and simply extract a sentence or phrase of the most prophetic nature. There has been numerous recent writings and discussions pertaining to a universal consciousness. Joseph Chilton Pierce, in his book, Evolution's End, talks about a universal thought stream, with reference to idiot savants. He poses the possibility that these savants are able to tap into this pool of universal knowledge but only extract a tiny slice of a particular knowledge form. Therefore they may be able to perform astounding mathematical calculations of a complex nature in a lightning fraction of a second, faster than a computer, or play the piano to near perfection, all without the mental ability to actually learn anything. In addition, John White, in his book entitled The Meeting of Mind and Spirit also gives credence to the existence of a planetary field of mind which is analogous to Dr. Carl Jung's concept of the collective unconscious. Could this possibly be what is happening to our developing children? In addition, if we scrutinize and compare the child's current development to the development of the same age child 20 years ago, we find some astonishing advancements such as the age of gait, the age of crawling, the age of stair climbing, and the age of speech. When I graduated from medical school in 1964, the statistics put forth by the American Podiatric Association showed that the average age of gait was thirteen and seven-tenths months. According to the statistics available today that age has been reduced to nine and eight-tenths months. I believe we can safely say that all the statistics in relation to child development has been greatly accelerated. The question is, why? I suggest that the answer involves alien manipulation of human genetics. In general and in considering all the factors I have enumerated, I cannot avoid the conclusion that in the future the field of ufology will become more scientific, eventually taking its rightful place among the other hard sciences."

        "text_source": "The same is true of the idea that is sometimes expressed that the futuristic craft sighted are actually products of the future activity of humanity. Our descendants of the distant [future], who have found the way to go back in time, come to observe us... It is obviously classic to try to reconstruct and observe the past via any of the traces that it leaves, and one could theoretically observe it directly (for example, by discovering a well-oriented mirror on a planet located a few light years a way). It is, however, out of the question for such an observation to be able to influence a bygone time in any way, except by being detectable. 8.3.2 Secret Weapons of a Superpower UAP Ds would then be piloted or remote-controlled craft of terrestrial origin. There is no lack of observers to believe that the object with fantastic performances that they saw maneuvering in the sky is the state of the art of military progress, which would explain the secrecy in which they are cloaked. Certainly studies such as those regarding the stealth aircraft or magneto-hydrodynamics actually lead to impressive progress. But besides the fact that it would be extremely unwise to expose to the eyes of laymen and foreign experts in this way what there has been so much interest in concealing, it can be added today that throughout the decades during which these phenomena have occurred, the secret would have inevitably come out, especially if the political upheavals of recent years are taken into account. 8.3.3 Disinformation Attempts Into this category fall special effects and montages, which are generally accompanied by a lot of media publicity. Some researchers believe that without necessarily lending themselves to the manufacture of ultramodern weapons, the performances of high-tech craft might serve to brainwash public opinion in the same way as other propaganda techniques. Of course, this point of view is a direct result of the cold war period. Any means were good at that time for destabilizing the other camp, including fear of an invasion by extraterrestrials or the instilling of doubt about leaders \"who hide anything manifestly serious from us. \" This type of hypothesis is even less satisfying than the preceding ones because it runs up against the objections to each of those. 8.3.4 Holographic Images At the junction between disinformation attempts and extraterrestrial hypotheses lies the technique of holographic images, whether they be the work of a superpower or extraterrestrial crews. In actual fact, this technique is difficult to employ. It requires considerable preparation because air is very transparent and diffuses light only very poorly. Therefore it is necessary to have large equipment covering the optical field used or at least to project an appropriate screen on it. for example, a film of water. The first method corresponds to theoretical holographic images, while the second is simpler and is frequently used for spectacular effects, but it obviously leaves traces behind... We can also envision using clouds or a curtain of rain, but this, of course, poses multiple hazards. Without necessarily being able to judge them at present, the method of holographic images and associated methods have only very limited use. 8.3.5 Unknown Natural Phenomena This hypothesis cannot be ruled out completely and must therefore be cited. However, it is difficult to support in cases where the UFO sighted behaves in an apparently intelligent manner (approach, pursuit, evasion, and escape maneuvers, etc.). 8.3.6 Extraterrestrial Hypotheses A large number of people today are convinced that UFOs are piloted by intelligent beings who have come from a very remote part of the universe and are tasked with watching us and even initiating contact with us. As appealing as they may be. these hypotheses run up against all sorts of huge difficulties. The hypothetical Martians only recently disappeared from the realm of possibility, and apart from earth, the solar system appears to be totally unable to have produced organized life and even more unable to have produced an advanced civilization. It is therefore necessary to look farther, to the stars, but the closest star is already one hundred million times further away than the moon. The only contacts that we may try to establish from such distances at present are radio contacts. Astronomers have attempted contacts via message transmission and radio listening in the \"SETI\" and \"MEGASETI\" programs. Although some enthusiasts have suggested futuristic ideas to \"bypass\" the vast expanse, such as, for example, the use of \"black holes,\" the crossing of interstellar distances by possible extraterrestrials has elicited much skepticism and the majority of astronomers reiterate that \"to date there has been no UFO case that is sufficiently well established to imply that it came from an extraterrestrial civilization. \" Two professional astronomers, Jean-Claude Ribes and Guy Monnet, have, however, proposed a scenario in our future in space that includes plausible interstellar voyages. In this scenario, which is summarized in Appendix 4, they envision the establishment of large communities in verdant \"islands in space, \" enormous artificial structures orbiting the earth, as described by the physicist O'Neill, and even inside large asteroids,-where an abundance of different materials, including water and oxygen, as well as ready protection against meteorites and cosmic radiation, are found. Later on, when our descendants have mastered the production, storage and use of antimatter as energy, they will utilize it to propel some of their habitats to another solar system. They will settle in an asteroid belt, start families there, and then visit the planets of the receiving system aboard craft that are perceived by any possible natives the same way we perceive UFOs today. This scenario, which in essence relies only on laws of physics that are currently well accepted, gives the extraterrestrial hypothesis a certain degree of plausibility; it is possible to imagine thai a civilization that came from somewhere else colonized the region of our asteroid belt and used it as a staging base to our planet. Current progress in the conquest of space and physics reinforces this idea. We should point out that some people envisage another hypothesis, which is much debated: the UFOs do belong to a civilization located in the asteroid belt, but this civilization itself comes from our planet. Older than any known terrestrial civilizations and highly advanced, it supposedly disappeared from earth (nuclear war, radioactivity, pollution, etc.) but resettled in the solar system. Both hypotheses have to their credit the fact that they place the UFO problem outside the realm of the paranormal and promote thought about the future of our planet."

        "text_source": "Abduction experiences also open the consciousness of abductees as I work with them to cycles of birth and death that are reminiscent of the Tibetan transitional realities or bardos (Sogyal Rinpoche 1992). This is most clearly illustrated in the past life experiences that are emerging increasingly in our sessions as I have become willing to listen to them. These reports suggest that individual consciousness may have its own line of development, separate from the body. In our sessions abductees such as Dave, Joe, Catherine, and Eva have told with great feeling of periods of embodiment, followed by deaths quite vividly reexperienced. They speak of a return to or diffusion into some sort of primal or universal creative consciousness or source, and then a later rebirth through a woman's womb into a new embodiment on Earth. The transition at the time of bodily death seems to include, as Joe recounted, a feeling of being literally lighter and thinner. \"It's good to be back,\" he said. 'This is much more real.\" Eva reported \"going up, expanding, joy.\" She went \"into a white, gold light\" and saw a dove released from a cage. ''That's my soul,\" she said. In certain cases the alien beings, who seem to reside or belong in this fluid dimension (although they periodically become embodied \u00b7 to some degree on Earth), seem to have been with the abductees through more than one lifetime. As discussed in considerable detail in Dave's and Joe's cases, it is possible to trace a development or evolution of consciousness in the sequence of lives that they have experienced over time. It is not necessary to postulate that a past life identity belongs literally to the individual abductee in the same way that our bodies are only ours while we inhabit them. As biologist Rupert Sheldrake has suggested, it is possible that there exi sts a kind of eternal collective memory on which we all may draw. One might, Sheldrake suggests, \"tune in to particular people in the past who are now dead, and, through morphic resonance, pick up memories of past lives.\" This does not prove, he says, that \"you were that person\" (Sheldrake 1992). This idea is consistent with the observation that the psyche or memory of the abductees seems to be able to travel, especially during the opening of consciousness that occurs in our sessions, to wherever or whenever the evolutionary requirement of the moment seems to take it. THE PARADIGM SHIFT Needless to say none of this makes much sense within the modern worldview brought to us by Western science, whose \"governing assumption,\" in philosopher Richard Tamas's words, is that \"any meaning the human mind perceives in the universe does not exist intrinsically in the universe but is projected onto it by the human mind\" (Tamas, in progress). To Tamas \"this complete voiding of the cosmos, this absolute privileging of the human\" is perhaps the ,\"ultimate anthropocentric projection, the most subtle yet prodigious form of human self-aggrandizement\" and represents an intellectual \"hubris of cosmic proportions.\" The experiences recounted by the abductees with whom I have worked during the past four years constitute, I think, a rich body of evidence to support the idea that the cosmos may contain at least a few types of beings or intelligences whose source and purpose is quite unknown to us. Abductees may be led through their experiences to feel that the cosmos is inherently intelligent in sub- , tie, complex, and exquisite ways that they can hardly begin to fathom. I am reminded, particularly, of Carlos here. Other evidence, including the thoroughly documented near-death experiences and extraordinarily intricate and symbolic crop formations appearing all over the world, provide additional indications, if we will allow ourselves to realize their implications, of various expressions of intelligence in a universe that is reaching toward us. As I come to the end of this story I cannot help wondering what it might take to bring about the shift in consciousness in the society as a whole, the change of paradigm, that is implicit in what the abductees have undergone. It would appear that what is required is a kind of cultural ego death, more profoundly shattering (a word that many abductees use when they acknowledge the actuality of their experiences) than the Copernican revolution which demonstrated that the earth, and therefore humankind, did not reside at the center of the cosmos. UFO abductions and related phenomena suggest first that humans are not the preeminent intelligent beings in a universe more or less empty of conscious life. But abductees' experiences also indicate that we are participating in a cosmos that contains intelligent beings that are far more advanced than we are in certain respects and have the power to render us helpless for purposes we are only just beginning to fathom."

I do not know what data supports that statement. However, Bob Girard addressed a similar theme in his book about octaves of intelligence. After comparing humanity's unchecked population growth and careless environmental pollution to spreading crab grass, Girard concluded that another octave of intelligence might be on the verge of exterminating imperfect humanity as humans would exterminate crab grass to protect a lawn. In Biblical history, that is supposed to be what happened in the times of Noah and Sodom and Gommorah. Bob wrote: The moral issue is: whether to annihilate the human plague entirely and non-selectively as the biological infestation humans are for the higher octave, or to first scan the human species and remove the most highly aware members before exterminating the unaware masses of the species. After a time, when the 'pesticide' has worn off, this nucleus of highly aware humans could be returned to the planet, to the human octave, to become the progenitors of the next human cycle. It has been said that one of the evils of any cycle of civilization is the tendency for knowledge which equals power to become concentrated among tiny cliques of intelligent men and converted from a means with which to serve all mankind into a means for forcing all of mankind to serve the knowledgeable. There is truth in the human octave that 'power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely'. There is a point at which knowledgeable men begin to fear that their knowledge would be misconstrued by ordinary men; that the ordinary man was not ready to have certain knowledge/power bestowed on him freely; that it is better for those few who know what knowledge is and what it can do to use it 'wisely', and thus protect man, in effect, from himself. There is, of course, a point at which this reasoning ceases to reflect genuine concern by the knowledgeable and begins to reflect a lust for power over one's neighbors and a hypocrisy which must justify the lofty words. * * Source: Elements of the Equation by Robert C.

However, the rewards are plentiful, at least if you put in the effort and ask the right questions. There are a number of subjects in this world that are like crowbars-they help us to pry open the barriers of deception and illusion that encase our minds and our lives. Ufology is an excellent one. By delving into its myriad aspects, we open ourselves up to a new understanding of nearly every aspect of our world. It causes us to ask the obvious existential question: are we alone in the universe? It's an important question, but barely scratches the surface of what lies below. As I have tried to show in this book, a proper study of ufology opens up vistas of thought in our politics, science, culture, technology, and more. It forces us to reconsider many of the truisms that underlie our worldview. That is exciting and unsettling. Small wonder that it has always been such a pariah of a topic, despite its deadly seriousness."

Although the subject was taboo at the time and I was advised against meeting other researchers, a young party official told me that sightings in the USSR were widespread and that the subject was followed with a great deal of interest. And at the Moscow Space Museum in 1971, during a concert tour with the London Symphony Orchestra, I saw a number of futuristic paintings depicting flying saucers-with one showing humanoid occupants. Fantasy? Or signposts to the future. The latest official announcements in the Soviet Union lend credence to the possibility that the late Dr. Hynek's fear may be realized: that the Russians will be the first to break the worldwide cover-up on UFOs. This is indeed an intriguing possibility, and the political and social consequences will, I am certain, have been given careful consideration by CIA analysts. I am equally certain that the Kremlin will have considered what political advantages are to be gained by making such an announcement. In 1920 a fascinating conversation took place between Lenin and H. G. Wells, which the latter related as follows:  I said to Lenin that the development of human technology might some day change the world situation. The Marxist conception itself would then become meaningless. Lenin looked at me and he said: \"You are right. I understood this myself when I read your novel The Time Machine. All human conceptions are on a scale of our planet. They are based on the pretension that the technical potential, although it will develop, will never exceed the 'terrestrial limit.' If we succeed in establishing interplanetary communication, all our philosophical, moral and social views will have to be revised. In this case, the technical potential, become limitless, would impose the end of the role of violence as a means and method of progress.\" There is no denying the possibility that once it is established beyond doubt that extraterrestrials are visiting our earth, the social, philosophical, scientific, and economic repercussions would have a profound effect on us all-irrespective of nationality. And should the visitors pose any kind of threat to humanity, the likelihood is that this will lead to an unprecedented degree of unity among nations. During the Geneva summit conference in November 1985 President Reagan made just this point to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when he told him \"how much easier his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this earth together.\""

The societal aspects of ant colonies are well known. Some of them use techniques that we, as intelligent life, have difficulty explaining. So, what characterizes intelligence? I choose that it is logic and the attendant mathematical lore that goes with it. So, intelligent life in the universe3 is expected to be logical and probably to be able to understand equations, and to design useful tools. Now, one could argue that ant colonies are sophisticated, and that their society is complex. However, if we found ant colonies on another planet, I doubt we would declare them intelligent. They, and the birds and the bees seem to survive more because of sophisticated instinct than logic. Fred Hoyle, a brilliant cosmologist, once wrote a science fiction book called The Black Cloud4 which described the psychic attack on Earth of a cloud of particles (each of no consequence by itself) dooming Earth. Since some alleged aliens have been reported as having psychic abilities, it is conceivable that they might be able to do all this logic and mathematics psychically, thereby suggesting lack of a logical thought process. However, I would argue that the logic and math exists in their society even though they may not put it on paper. For example, the process of remote viewing has been enhanced by a logical treatment of the procedures, and random number generators are yielding a wealth of impressive data in both time and space. Therefore, in discussing alien societies and motives, I'm going to assume that it is reasonable to assess their motives, means and opportunity on a logical basis, and that they have access to no different set of equations or physics or biology than we do. If their society is older, they could logically be able to understand our universe more clearly with even better concept and attendant equations than we have. In summary, my perspective is that it is logical to assume that the laws of nature apply equally everywhere. Alien diseases and the science fiction classics  The public, the government, and the media have all been influenced by two powerful stories, both made into movies, and they have affected how we potentially view alien creatures. The first one, the famous War of the Worlds6 by H. G. Wells, has been made into at least one famous radio broadcast7 and two movies. Here the invading Martian aliens (big, destructive, seemingly mechanical) attempt to kill everyone in sight until at the end they die, killed by one of our own infections. In the second classic story, The Andromeda Strain8, an exploratory craft is brought back to earth ahead of schedule for classified reasons, and crashes in a rural area, and those who investigate, including the town's doctor, are killed by a deadly pathogen, which turns out to be classified as a virus having a fascinating structure and mechanism of action. We have been preparing for this event for decades, so with multi-levels of biologic security at the disease control center, and by clever reasoning, we are able to defeat the disease just before it kills everyone in the story, and subsequently, the earth's population. This too has been made into a movie very effectively.9 In Chapter 17, you will read about how there was unusual interest in this story by our biological warfare folks. These stories have major significance towards the perception of UFOs by the Government and by the public. The War of the Worlds left the impression, partly because of media hype, that millions of people were panicked by the potential threat of aliens. Actually, according to historians, two people died, one from a heart attack and one from running a red light.10 Those who were upset were limited to those who were near the alleged landing locations of the aliens. Nevertheless, the image stuck: aliens will cause panic if they are here. This assumption, in my opinion, significantly influenced governments to suppress the genuine potential extraterrestrial sightings and indeed - the early indications that we thought they were extraterrestrial.11 Therefore, avoiding panic became one of the centerpieces of policy for UFO management by the U.S. The second book, The Andromeda Strain is also significant in that it deals with the potential panic, but introduces a reality found today for the study and control of communicable diseases in both mostly unclassified (Center for Disease Control, Atlanta) and classified (Fort Detrick, Maryland) research institutions run by the Government. Similar highly sophisticated multi-level containment facilities exist in industry for research. The sophistication of these facilities transcends those in The Andromeda Strain, both here and in the former Soviet Union at Biopreparat and indeed at Porton Down, to be introduced in Chapter 15. Leaked classified documents describe a robust UFO recovery program since the 40s  The concerns for the containment of alien pathogens probably began with the Cape Girardoux alien, allegedly held up for a photo by two federal agents.12 We have no data on whether they became ill after the recovery event; however, The Majestic Documents13 include three rather specific and significant references to crash recoveries. The first is the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit preliminary report on the Roswell crashes signed July 16,1947. The second is the 1st Annual Report (published after March 1951, based on an internal reference), dealing with extensive review of all the technology from UFOs to date. The third is the Special Operations Manual, or SOM 1-01, entitled Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal.14 The first two of these leaked documents appear to be drafts of final versions, whereas the SOM 1-01 is a final, proofread, professionally produced field manual printed in 1954 on a hot lead printing press. The quotations from these three documents unite the discovery of lethal pathogens with the application to biological warfare for all to see. The storage of tissue samples at Ft. Detrick makes it very clear that these issues will not be studied by those without proper security clearances, and that the leading edge research undoubtedly went right to classified facilities and has stayed there. It would be very reasonable to conjecture that the understanding of retroviruses probably BEGAN there, and leaked into the outside literature years later. This might explain why the search for retro-virus prior to 1951 in the open literature has been fruitless. In addition, the hyphenated version of the word has never been found in the unclassified literature. Some skeptics have argued that this suggests that the document is a fake because of this error. However, a careful evaluation of the 17 pages of the 1st Annual Report reveals 37 hyphenated verb, adjectives and nouns. The author of the report clearly favored the use of hyphens when in doubt.15 Each reader can decide whether the author of the 1st Annual Report was hyphen-happy. In addition, the authenticity of the date of this report is enhanced by the forensic linguistic aspect that in the 40s, the use of hyphens for compound words was much more common than it is today. It would be reasonable to imagine that the study of all epidemics (epidemiology) would be often if not mostly classified. The preceding history and quotations suggest to the ambitious student of biological warfare that the creation of a super weapon might well be possible. In the military research of the late 1940's weapons of mass destruction were quite in vogue, both in the USA and the USSR."

I said to Lenin that the development of human technology might some day change the world situation. The Marxist conception itself would then become meaningless. Lenin looked at me and he said:  \t'You are right. I understood this myself when I read your novel The Time Machine. All human conceptions are on a scale of our planet. They are based on the pretension that the technical potential, although it will develop, will never exceed the terrestrial limit. If we succeed in establishing interplanetary communication, all our philosophical, moral and social views will have to be revised. In this case, the technical potential, become limitless, would impose the end of the role of violence as a means and method of progress.' There is no denying the possibility that, once it is established beyond doubt that extraterrestrials are visiting Earth, the social, philosophical, scientific and economic repercussions would have a profound effect on us all, irrespective of differing nationalities. Should the 'visitors' pose threats to humanity, the likelihood is that this will lead to an unprecedented degree of unity between the nation-states. During the Geneva summit conference of November 1985, US President Ronald Reagan made that point to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev when he told him 'how much easier his task and mine might be in these meetings that we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from another planet outside in the universe. We'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our countries, and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this Earth together.' In referring to this discussion during a speech given at the Kremlin in 1987, Gorbachev added that 'The US President said that if the Earth faced an invasion by extraterrestrials, the United States and the Soviet Union would join forces to repel such an invasion. I shall not dispute the hypothesis, though I think it's early yet to worry about such an intrusion ...'"

        "text_source": "Cosmogony  Janus expounded on cosmogony - the origin of life in the universe - seemingly lending support to the so-called 'Big Bang' theory, which he referred to as 'the generally accepted theory' of an expanding universe that 'originated from the giant explosion of a vast area of high density gas which contained all the elements necessary for life and matter'. 'If you accept this theory,' he went on, 'then all galaxies contain the elements necessary for life and matter; even at the very boundaries of the expansion, the original explosion is still distributing these elements . If you accept the theory of the expanding universe you accept that it is an ocean of galaxies with solar and planetary systems similar to our own. By the laws of probability there must be millions of planets in the universe supporting life, and within our own galaxy thousands supporting life more advanced than on Earth.' Earth is a young planet with its Sun a young mother. We may hazard a guess that other planets in [this] solar system are unlikely to support life except in possibly rudimentary cellular form and are no more than uninhabited and hostile islands. But imagine a galactic solar system somewhere in space with conditions similar to Earth except that its Sun is in the autumn of its life. Provided its inhabitants have survived wars and alien invasion, it is impossible to imagine what super-technology and cultural advancement they have reached . . .  A Prediction  Janus predicted correctly that 'perhaps in twenty years' time manned rockets will be commonplace and the Earth will be girdled by satellites of all sorts and sizes', and that there would be 'great strides in the miniaturization of all our present technology, advances in navigational guidance and communication over vast distances'. Non-Interference  Why then were aliens coming here? 'The answer is that this traffic is only a thin trickle in the vast highways of the universe,' explained Janus. 'The Earth after all is a galactic backwater inhabited by only half-civilized men, dangerous even to their neighbours . . .' Most of these vehicles are robot-controlled space probes monitoring what is going on. Some are manned in order to oversee the whole programme and to ensure the probes do not land or crash by accident. They must also ensure that evidence of their existence is kept away from the vast majority of Earth's population. You must be well aware of the damage which your own explorers have done by appearing and living among simple tribes, often leading to a complete disintegration of their society and culture . Such impact is far too indigestible and only the most developed societies can cope with such contact . The basic principle of responsible space exploration is that you do not interfere with the natural development and order of life in the universe any more than you should upset or destroy an ant heap or bee-hive ... You will have to grow a lot older and learn how to behave on your own planet, if indeed you do not blow yourselves up between times, before you are ready for galactic travel. The Observers  'Since time immemorial,' Janus continued, 'there have been tales of vessels coming out of the sky bringing strange visitors. Observers do come among you and make contact on a very selective basis where they judge that such contact could not harm either party.' These observers have studied Earth for a long time. With advanced medical science they have been fitted with the right sort of internal equipment to allow their bodies to operate normally until they leave. It is not very difficult to obtain the right sort of clothes and means to move around quite freely . The observers are not interested in interfering in your affairs, but once you are ready to escape from your own solar system it is of paramount importance that you have learnt your responsibilities for the preservation of life everywhere . While you are still far away from travelling in deep space, such contacts will be infrequent and must be conducted with great secrecy ... The observers have very highly developed mental powers, including extra-sensory, thought reading, hypnosis and the ability to use different dimensions . . . and rely solely on their special powers to look after themselves. They make contact only with selected people where secrecy can be maintained. In the loosely-knit societies of the Western world, particularly in England and America, it is fairly easy with the help of friends to do this but not in police and dictator states."

By his account, the greys are distant ancestors of Martians, who are even now struggling with the loss of atmosphere and environment on their own planet. Both the Martians and the greys tried to cope with their realities by external intellect. They built spaceships and other devices to help them in their evolution, but lost the internal energy of love and emotion-the so-called Christ-Consciousness-that allows all sentient beings to connect with the universal whole. The Greys now realize that to get out of the trap they created for themselves by separating themselves from the source of life, they have to get back their emotional bodies. Unfortunately, the only way they know how to do this is by studying us intellectually, which, of course, will never work, explained Frissell. However, according to Drunvalo, the greys made contact with a secret government on Earth prior to World War II and have traded their advanced technology for the right to experiment on the earth, which included animal mutilations and human abductions. Whether you call them the secret government, the Illuminati, the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission, or the Council on Foreign Relations, the name is irrelevant, Frissell noted, echoing the statements of Bramley and others. The 'secret government' is basically made up of the richest people in the world. There are about 2,000 of them and they have been controlling our so-called governments for a long time. They control who gets elected, when, and where; they control when there is a war and when there isn't. They control planetary food shortages and whether a country's currency is inflated or deflated. All these things are dominated completely by these people. They can't control natural disasters, of course, but they can and do control a lot. Drunvalo said that by the late 1960s, this secret government learned from scientists that a planetary disaster was imminent and began to join their assets in both the United States and the former Soviet Union in an effort to design an escape plan for themselves. He said that both nations secretly used grey technology to build their own saucers and that about 50 percent of the UFOs sighted are our own. He added that this secret government has built secret bases on both the moon and Mars, explaining some of the anomalies on both. However, in basically supporting this Alternative 3 scenario, Drunvalo said that the people within the secret government have become like the greys and are in danger of losing their emotional bodies to sheer intellect. According to Drunvalo, the greys are on the way out, not having learned enough regarding inner growth to survive on their physical plane. And members of the secret government have begun to realize that they cannot survive on their own. They need love and unity consciousness too and so are allowing more and more material to be made available to a wider public audience in opposition to their previous policy of maintaining strict secrecy."

        "text_source": "I believe these critiques reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of rationality and reason, and even of science itself. For what the worldview implicit in these statements requires is the a priori exclusion of vast amounts of data simply because that information is in conflict with that point of view. This, I believe, is a far more irrational, and even dangerous, approach to knowledge than to allow information from every possible legitimate source to come into our minds before applying rationality and reason in assessing this information once we have \"let it in.\" To exclude data because it does not fit a particular view of reality can only, in the end, arrest the progress of science and keep us ignorant. The worldview that Gleick, Gifford, and Miles espouse is what is usually called the \"materialist paradigm.\" According to this view, which until recently has dominated mainstream science (although now it is increasingly being questioned, even in contemporary physics), there is only one hard rea_lity, namely that which is observable through the sensory/empirical mode. This dualistic approach would separate cleanly the observer from the observed, subject from object. In so doing, all of the information about other or \"unseen\" realities that has become available to us through anthropology, comparative religion, parapsychology, consciousness research, and various uses of nonordinary states inside and outside the laboratory-to name but a few sources of data-would, of necessity, have to be excluded. This worldview and its accompanying restrictive epistemology would, in short, eliminate human consciousness and experience as legitimate ways of knowing about reality. Of the many responses which were more open to my material, Kathryn Robinson's reaction to Gleick's review (Robinson 1994) was one of the most telling. Addressing the restrictiveness of the worldview that Gleick's assault reflected she wrote, \"scientific discovery is not a matter of jamming data into existing categories\ufffd it's about supporting new ones. It's about admitting how much we don't know-in marked contrast to the hubris of a rationalist such as Gleick, who argues that any phenomenon that's not available to his senses must therefore be a sham. Gleick's arrogance,\" she notes, \"would perhaps approach respectability if there were no mysteries left to science.\" Psychologist William James made the same point a hundred years ago. \"The ideal of every science,\" James wrote, \"is that of a closed and completed system of truth .... Phenomena unclassifiable within a system are therefore paradoxical absurdities and must be held untrue (James 1896).\" As I discuss throughout this book, our knowledge of the abduction phenomenon depends, fundamentally,\u00b7 upon human experience-i.e., the reports of the abductees themselves and the recording, sifting, and evaluating of these reports by the investigator. That is, of necessity, a participatory process in which the person exploring the experiences-in this case myself-must enter fully and empathically into the experiencer's world in order to create the context of trust that will bring forth the relevant information. My reasons for taking these experiences seriously are discussed throughout the book, including Appendix A. They have to do essentially with the consistency of reports conveyed with extreme intensity of feeling by sincere individuals of sound mind in the United States and now, increasingly, from around the world, who may themselves doubt profoundly-or would wish to forget-the reality of what they have undergone. No plausible alternative explanation for the reports of abduction experiences, which are sometimes corroborated by physical evidence, has been discovered. This book provides the most detailed accounts we have to date from people who report abduction experiences. These reports, I xii PREFACE TO THE PAPERBACK EDITION believe, raise profound questions about how we experience the world around us and the very nature of that world. The information that I obtained during the several years of this investigation has been communicated in case after case with such power and consistency that a body of data formed which seemed to point clearly to the experiential truth of the abduction phenomenon, whatever its ultimate source might prove to be. The fact that what the experiencers are describing simply cannot be possible according to our traditional scientific view would, it seems to me, more sensibly, yes rationally, call for a change in that perspective, an expansion of our notions of reality, rather than the \"jamming\" of \"data into existing categories\" that some critics would have us do. It was in the hope of serving a misunderstood population by making sense of their experiences, and, above all, of provoking my readers to reconsider their views of the universe in which we live, that I undertook to write this book."

Right up to the end, they have no reason to suspect the treachery that suddenly awaits them as they huddle in the cramped pens of the slaughterhouse. Extrapolating toward the macro-cosmic, it is quite possible, perhaps inevitable, that the entire human life cycle is subordinated to the needs of an unperceived macrospecies. ...We may fill some emotional or psychological need, maybe as pets or someone's ant farm. We may be a planet-sized laboratory colony in which our behavior and reactions to various stimuli are being studied. We could be a proving ground for biological or medical experiments in much the way we breed and maintain mice so that we can test the effects of chemicals or drugs before endangering ourselves by using them. In any case, we are kept 'human'. Whether its intentions are 'good' or 'evil' (as imperfectly as we understand those terms) is irrelevant for now, just as it is irrelevant to question human motives for controlling various other life forms. We need them under present circumstances. It is likely the same for the species/universe which exercises control over humanity. John Keel often wrote* about a controlling intelligence in human affairs, as he did in this excerpt from a 1982 magazine article, The Endless Procession: **  Our studies of the UFO percipients and contactees are teaching us that these encounters are more hallucinatory than real, that some complex hypnotic process is involved, and that the real phenomenon is hiding behind a carefully engineered smoke screen of propaganda. Those funny lights and their hypnotic waves of energy are part of something that is related to this planet, and to us. But that something may be far beyond our meager powers of comprehension. There are forces that can distort our reality and warp our fields of space and time. When we are caught in these forces, we struggle to find an acceptable explanation for them, and then the manifestations begin to conform to that explanation and so reinforce it... The ancient gods, and their successors, the god-kings, lied to us and manipulated us and there's no indication that the tactics of the modern Ufonauts are any different."

        "text_source": "G and L were adamant that all answers to our future and all the lessons of history had been written down for us to learn from and live by. Each major  culture  and  each  primitive  culture  had  its  standards,  explained Thomas, but the move from a basic, primitive life to a life where selfish motives, however noble we tried to make them seem, prevailed, could and would lead to disaster and the final extinction of the human race. Our Christian Bible, supposedly, was the full account of ourselves, the written path of homo sapiens. There may well be many truths passed down in the Bible-as in many other religious documents-as I have remarked on later. But I find it puzzling that the aliens failed at least to acknowledge some of the inconsistencies in various translations of the Bible over the centuries. Exactly how much of it is factual? Thomas's team had no axe to grind in this regard. By their own admission, they were neither atheists nor practicing Christians in the recognized manner, as Thomas puts it. However, G and L did indicate that we were a world of too many religions, and would suffer for being so. They said the core of our numerous religions and creeds was a good and right way forward, but eventually humans would sacrifice their beliefs in a selfish manner, and our leaders would lazily accept this. . . . I remember how G placed his hand upon his chest and 'said' the incident at Roswell, New Mexico, and certain others, was a part of the 'Path to Doom' for the human race. He said items stolen from them at that time would show us how to live well and prosper greatly in a way that no human need ever go hungry or thirsty, and all human problems could be solved using their technology before the century we called the twentieth ended. But, he added, those in power will not wish it; rather would they have what they see as greater power. The aliens acknowledged the existence of Jesus, furthermore indicating that the so-called Second Coming was already in force (as also implied by Henry Dohan in Chapter 7). OFFICIALDOM FRUSTRATED On several occasions, the duty officer complained to the team regarding official frustration at their inability to gain access to the inside of the craft. One of the team, Ian, said they'd done all they could-as would have been evident on the taped recordings of all their communications to, if not from, G and L. Several days later, the aliens responded, pointing out that the craft contained a self-destructive device which would operate if entry by any beings other than themselves was accomplished. They made it very clear, said Thomas, that they could open the craft in a matter of seconds in human time, and seal it closed just as rapidly. Only massive power could open it falsely. They told us the problem at Roswell was that having come in peace to exchange thoughts and certain technology, the mechanism of self-destruction concealed behind the small panel, with what we called a pentacle on it, was switched off. It seems G and L and their missing friend switched theirs to 'on' again before the craft closed. . . . G and L told us they had no intention at this time to open the craft. When I first met Thomas, he told me that this craft had come down of  its  own  volition  while  the  military  combed  the  site  where  the  other craft had crashed. He said that G and L were upset about the cruelty and treachery of their American captors in betraying their word. Given their wide knowledge of human fallibility, one can only wonder at the apparent na\u00efvet\u00e9 of G and L in this respect. ANCIENT HISTORY The aliens expounded on their presence here on Earth thousands of years ago. Like the species with whom Carl Anderson liaised (Chapter 7), G and L described how their own people had been present during the times of the many kings (named Pharoahs after 950  b.c.) who ruled Ancient Egypt, and how the aliens were described as Gods, but of course they were not. Thomas's team was advised not to mock what is written in the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud, or similar writings that foretell the future. For example, the great flood did occur and destroyed cities and countries, but mountains were left dry and habitable. They told us that a simple, basic change in the Earth's axis angle had caused  the  vast  flooding,  and  that  included  the  destruction  of  the  lost land of what we now call Atlantis, which lay close to what is the island of Cuba. They produced maps of those places and times showing Antarctica before it was ice-bound, and land bridges before the final dividing of the land masses which were one. They told us these maps exist today copied onto the skins of antelopes in our sixteenth century, but only one has been shown to present humans, yet thirty of them exist even now in the land known as Turkey. They explained how their presence in Central America at a place known as Aztlan was to obtain gold and to enrich cultures and races that preceded the Mayas, [and] the forefathers of Aztecs were the people of Aztlan and that the great floods drove them from their original, ancestral homeland. The aliens needed gold-and later silver-exclusively as part of their craft's propulsion system. THE MOTHERSHIP At around 23:00 one pleasant warm night in 1957 at Weston Zoyland, Thomas became aware of a strange presentiment. There was little sound to begin with, he wrote, then a few shouts and the noise of vehicles, then the noise of a helicopter. But then our office phone rang. 'Code Orange! Code Orange! Have you any problems? I need an immediate appraisal of your situation.' Alan came rushing in, saying, 'Come outside quick! Lights, zooming about. Amazing!' Thomas reported the matter, adding that he was going outside to see what was happening. Watch the aliens, he was told. Do not leave them alone. Our two friends were fine, noted Thomas, seated up against their 'home'  couches  and  staring  ahead. I  asked  if  they  were  all  right  and, receiving affirmation, went to look outside, leaving [colleagues] Keith and Cyril with them. 'Do not be concerned,' one said. 'We are passing messages to our people. You can so inform your seniors later.'"

It goes without saying that the advantages and risks would have to be studied carefully. 13.3.1 Influences on Preindustrial-Age Civilizations We might consider it necessary, in certain cases, to influence the environment in a specific manner and the evolution of local civilizations in a subtle way. It might seem necessary to us, upon completion of our observations and our analyses, to modify, bit by bit, the natural environment and the ecosystem by, for example, seeding or introducing select plants and organisms that are lacking. Likewise, the course of indigenous civilizations could be gradually modified by influencing, either from a distance or directly, the qualities or defects of select individuals, accentuating their intellectual and moral tendencies and their scientific knowledge, or by causing genetic mutations by different processes that are yet to be invented. In this case, it would be a matter of playing the roie that these populations would have willingly reserved for gods, who, by providing sacred texts. would reorient, for example, their sense of morals, their religiosity, and perhaps their laws and their political institutions. The use of elements likely to terrify and impress could be appropriate in some cases. And, with all due reverence, nothing would prevent one from thinking of different episodes in the Old Testament, the conditions under which the laws of Manu were instituted (10) or even the Koran given. The influences relate back to a certain number of enigmas in history, including. perhaps, the concomitant appearance of the great civilizations of the Indus, Mesopotamia, and Egypt (cities, architecture, writing, calendar, astronomy, etc.). They also call to mind the extraordinary map of the Antarctic, which was drawn almost free of ice by the Frenchman Oronce Fine in 1583, nearly three centuries prior to the discovery of this continent in 1820 (11). 13.3.2 Influences on Industrial-Age Civilizations The nature of these influences will vary according to the type of civilization, its technological development, and its psychological acclimatization or lack thereof to the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. It would be advisable beforehand to accustom the mind of these populations to the idea of the probable existence of extraterrestrial civilizations (science-fiction novels, films, cartoon strips, video games, advertisements, a favorable psychological climate, [and] why not suitable sects?, etc.). New and essential technological knowledge could be provided via different avenues or by means of chance or provoked accidents with one of our spacecraft. The contemporary Roswell case thus comes to mind. In order for the craft to be retained in full (or disposed of), it would still have been necessary for the U.S. government to in fact have wanted to show, communicate and have analyzed, without beating around the bush, all of the elements that it actually recovered on that occasion. 13.4 Phase Four: Direct Contacts A fourth phase would be that of establishing direct contact with the locals or with entire populations, whether or not a vanguard of bionic robots were used. Once again, the goals sought must be precisely determined. The benefit and true utility of establishing such contacts must be weighed with care in order to calculate the risks and consequences. A specific program could plan for these. However, a serious technical accident affecting one of our spacecraft could be the start of an unofficial contact, a necessary settlement, or a colonization, or even, if necessary, an informationdisinformation campaign. It is also advisable to envision the sedition of some of our crews whom it might be necessary to disembark or who might decide on their own authority to live on one of the worlds discovered and, ultimately, mix with the indigenous populations, going against orders received, whether willingly or against their will, not to intervene or interfere in local affairs. These contacts presuppose that the worlds discovered are populated with human beings or hominids whose complexion is identical or close to oors. But under the hypothesis of contacts and planned long-term settlements of members of our crews, should mixes be prohibited, as prophylaxis, by imposing a major ban on them (12) or, on the contrary, should they be tolerated and even encouraged? Bear in mind that direct or prolonged contacts would inevitably lead the indigenous populations to believe, in fine, that we are not so different from them. It would be prudent, however, to send remotecontrolled androids in advance in order to assess the reactions that such an intrusion would arouse, or to acclimate the populations to the idea through furtive, episodic appearances. What would happen if we encountered populations composed of beings that were deformed or monstrous in our eyes? The visual effect would certainly be startling and a choice subject for their media and ours, but the types of contact would consequently be different, or at least we can assume so. 13.4.1 Direct Contacts with Preindustrial-Age Civilizations It is certain that such contacts would immediately cause the local populations to imagine that they are in the presence of gods. Historical parallels naturally come to mind: the arrival of the Spaniards in Central America in armor and on horseback, or, more generally, the arrival of the Europeans at the time of the discovery and exploration of the globe. The impact on populations that had never seen horses, armor that shone brightly in the sun, or white men, particularly with blond or red hair, had to be felt strongly. However, the shock of these apparitions would be quickly lessened with the multiplication of relations, and even more so if our crews were to take an eminent place in the local political and military orders. This, of course, relates back to the different epics of the discovery of the world, European colonization, and also the end of the western empires. 13.4.2 Direct Contacts with Industrial-Age Civilizations The day would come when we believed that these civilizations, gradually brought to our level through our efforts, are able to participate in our world. With the ground prepared in advance, contacts could, for example, be established discretely with select individuals or at the highest level of the States, or of some of them, and, if possible, be kept secret. Although leaks should not be ruled out, the leaders selected would then have to conduct information, disinformation, and counter-information campaigns to maintain the privileged nature of these relations and, who knows, to benefit, from our side, from novel scientific, technical, and political information, giving them an edge over their rivals. The selection of States, rulers, key figures, or mere individuals would, of course, be of paramount importance. Before or after the implementation of an influencing program, why not imagine having bionic robots that look like humans or resemble the living beings there appear in order not to risk the lives of members of our expeditions? Finally, why not purely and simply present ourselves openly and publicly? It is easy to imagine the huge sensation that this would cause in all psychological, political, military, strategic, and religious spheres, to say nothing of the media, [as well as the] multiple meetings and international colloquiums, uninterrupted sessions of organizations such as the UN, calls for \"world unity, \" international consultations, the creation of welcoming committees, etc. [that it would prompt]. The rivalry of the States would be interesting to observe. It goes without saying that our intentions must be perceived as peaceful. If this were not our policy, there would, of course, be no need to take special precautions to show consideration for the sentiments of the local populations. In all of these scenarios, we should encounter idolaters, sycophants, Herodians, who, out of a millenalist conviction, gullibility, pragmatism, or interest, would welcome us with enthusiasm as saviors, capable of solving all of their problems and bringing them peace and prosperity, preferably without having to exert much effort. These would be our first allies."

        "text_source": "Still, the path toward understanding the UFO phenomenon \u2013 and its associated cover-up \u2013 took major strides during the period under review. I subtitled this book, The Cover-up Exposed because it was during the 1970s and 1980s that the UFO cover-up was shown to have existed beyond any reasonable doubt. Prior to the age of FOIA, government denials about UFOs could not as easily be refuted. Undoubtedly, good research had been done in the 1950s and 1960s that demonstrated the UFO reality and the likelihood of a cover-up. But it was only after thousands of pages of government documents were released under the Freedom of Information Act that researchers could prove with an overwhelming avalanche of data that military and intelligence agencies had taken the matter with extreme consideration and care. UFOs were proven to be serious business, regardless of their ultimate origin. The cover-up was exposed still further by the growing number of leaks that began to occur during the late 1970s. Some were more persuasive than others, but all pointed to the existence of UFO crash retrievals and the existence of a back-engineering program. By 1980, it looked as though luck might favor those researchers seeking to end the cover-up. Although this did not occur, it is still true that many aspects of UFO secrecy were attacked and revealed during the 1970s and 1980s. Despite the arguments, controversies, and even disinformation that pervaded the field at times, progress was made. As the world transformed, so did ufology. The advent of the Internet immediately and profoundly changed the nature of research into this subject. Many researchers were not happy with these changes, but the wide-open nature of the information highway brought many new opportunities to share data and ideas. It also made implementing the cover-up more problematic, at least until better control over it could be achieved by political and corporate elites. This is a struggle that continues to the present day, the final outcome of which has yet to be determined. Perhaps the most important development of the period under review is how ufology turned its attention to the aliens themselves. It was one thing to study specific UFO sightings in an attempt to find patterns and understand the technologies involved. But what happened during the 1970s was the beginning of the first focused attempt by the human race to understand the beings behind the phenomenon, while making proper exception of course for those black-world people and groups who had (probably) already been trying to do this secretly. It was the moment in which the object of study \u2013 that is, humanity \u2013 attempted to turn the situation around and understand just who or what was studying it. The moment was a significant one not simply in the history of ufology, but of human consciousness. Such efforts were only the beginning, of course, and years later much still needs to be done. Understanding the intelligences behind the UFO phenomenon remains the great challenge of the subject. Developing the necessary insight will require a change not simply to our social, economic, and political world, but to our consciousness itself. Whoever and whatever these beings are, they appear to exist and act in ways that most humans are not prepared or able to match. In a world in which billions go hungry, and billions more spend their waking hours in repetitive jobs, mindlessly surfing the Internet, playing video games, or watching the television, it is safe to say that most people are not ready to deal with the existence of an alien race that may be of exceptional intelligence, and may well be telepathic \u2013 if numerous claims of abductees and experiencers are to be believed. Nor of an alien race that surely has an agenda of some sort."

        "text_source": "INFORMATION AND THE ALTERATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS The other important, related aspect of the abduction phenomenon has to do with the provision of information and the alteration of consciousness of the abductees. This is not a purely cognitive process, but one that reaches deeply into the emotional and spiritual lives of the experiencers, profoundly changing their perceptions of themselves, the world, and their place in it. This information concerns the fate of the earth and human responsibility for the destructive activities that are taking place on it. It is conveyed by the direct mind-to-mind telepathic communication referred to above and through powerful images shown on television monitor-like screens on the ships themselves. The information may begin to be conveyed when the abductees are children or adolescents (see Arthur, chapter 15, and Ed, chapter 3), but its implications are not fully understood until much later. The investigator seems to play an important part in enabling the abductee to bring forth and realize the significance of the information they have been receiving during abductions that have been taking place over many years. Scenes of the earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, vast panoramas of lifeless polluted landscapes and waters, and apocalyptic images of giant earthquakes, firestorms, floods, and even fractures of the planet itself are shown by the aliens. These are powerfully disturbing to the abductees, who tend to experience them as literally predictive of the future of the planet. Some abductees are given assignments in this future holocaust as it is displayed, such as to feed the survivors, or are told, as in the prophetic books of the Bible, that some will perish while others will be taken to another place to participate in the evolution of life in the universe. Some abduction researchers believe that these images are not shown for the purpose of altering the course of the planet's history in a positive way. Rather, they maintain, the beings are studying the experiencers' reactions and are deceiving them into believing that they are concerned with our fate while they proceed to take over our planet, their own having presumably been destroyed by an apocalypse of science and technology similar to the fate that might befall us (various personal communications 1990-93; also Scott, chapter 5). They argue further that if the aliens were truly concerned with our well-being they would manifest themselves more forthrightly and intervene directly in our affairs in order to make things better. Abduction experiencers report that the aliens themselves, when confronted with this issue, say that we are not ready to acknowledge their existence, and would treat them aggressively as an enemy as we do anyone or anything different from ourselves that we do not understand. But most importantly, the aliens say, their methods are different. Some abductees report that the aliens do not wish to bring about change through coercion but rather through a change of consciousness that would lead to our choosing a different course. Some abductees receive information of battles for the fate of the earth and the control of the human mind, between two or more groups of beings, some of which are more evolved or \"good,\" while others are less evolved or \"evil.\" The abductees usually report fewer details of their return to Earth than they do of their abduction. Usually they are returned to the bed or car from which they were taken, but sometimes \"mistakes\" are made. They may be returned quite a distance, or even miles, away from their home. This is rare, and I have seen no cases of this kind, although Budd Hopkins has told me of such instances. Smaller mistakes are more common, such as landing the experiencer facing in the wrong direction on the bed, with his or her pajamas on backwards or inside out, or with certain garments or jewelry missing. Sometimes the aliens seem to be making a point, or a certain humor is involved. One two-year-old among my cases was tucked into his bed tightly after an abduction, which the parents say that neither they nor his older sister had done; he, of course, was incapable of doing this. Hopkins tells of a case where two abductees were returned to the wrong cars. As they drove along the highway the drivers recognized each other's cars."

For instance, new developments in gaming, will soon be virtual reality immersion. Why bother trying to solve real-world problems (or even learning about them) when you can become a virtual James Bond or date your favorite movie star in a near-real-life immersive setting? The western world long ago mastered the art of public relations in the service of political conformity and corporate profits. Clearly, the lessons of the past will be applied to our brave new world. The result may well be a zombie world of people drugged up on pharmaceuticals, ingesting processed and unhealthy GMO foods, uneducated in the history of their society, and living in an illusory world designed to distract and deflect. In other words, what modern America and much of the world already looks like, only more so, with people detached from their true selves, spinning out fantasies and simply running out the clock. Granted, alarmists have made such claims for years about the impact of magazines, comic books, radio dramas and more. However, we might remind ourselves that some of those criticisms were probably valid. More to the point, the power of our current system of distractions is much greater than anything human culture has experienced before. In such a world, there could even be a danger of specific classes and even subspecies of humanity being developed. There could be, quite literally, a master race with greater strength and intelligence, and with longer lifespans, presiding over a world of human drones, kept suitably stupid for a life of service and distraction. We already have clear and distinct classes of humanity; what is to prevent such a nightmare from entering our very biology? If such a future comes to fruition, perhaps it will be possible to keep the end of UFO secrecy at bay for a much longer time. Perhaps. But for how long? A century? Two centuries? At some point, even in such an awful future, the secrecy program would merely be an exercise in staving off the inevitable. Even under the worst circumstances, the end of secrecy will come. Besides, the situation is unlikely to deteriorate quite that rapidly before, say, 2035 or so, roughly twenty years from this writing. The relevance of all this for Disclosure is that because we are changing so rapidly, it seems very likely that we will develop the capability, openly and finally, to prove the matter of UFO reality to ourselves without need for official government acknowledgment. Once we get to that point, once this reality is rapidly and widely understood, governments around the world will have no choice but to acknowledge the obvious."

Sad to say, not all of what we have learned about the behavior of certain members of the human family is encouraging. \u2022\u2022\u2022  Nothing you read anywhere-not even in this book-will fully explain the crop circle mystery; not today or even tomorrow. The enigma may never be fully explained, but I am certain that we are being given hints as to where it comes from, and where it might be going. These hints are fascinating, and they fill me with intrigue and excitement. But not having all the answers does not mean that we should stop using our imagination in an attempt to understand. Imagining possible futures and searching for answers is what drives the evolving engine of human potential, and it is what contributes to the growth of our human civilization. It is quite possible that mankind will never fully understand the intricate workings of the master plan of our existence. But we are regularly being given hints and clues, and I think that many of us have evolved enough to intuitively sense when we are being presented with glimpses of the underlying structure of this master plan. The crop circle mystery could simply be outside our realm of understanding. The answers may be locked in a dimension somewhere external to the boundaries of our current reality. Some crop researchers have speculated that the crop circle patterns are visible energy discharges between dimensions, and that we can only see half (or less) of the actual anomaly. That may be true, and the theory illustrates the difficulties-knowing what to consider and what to reject-when working with the crop circle riddle. We are now living in an age of microbiology, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. We are regularly creating new materials and developing new techniques that allow us to employ the highest levels of technological skills known to man in our pursuit of knowledge. Eyeing some hoped-for human benefit, we are now able to combine genes from the plant kingdom with genes from the animal kingdom. Man can now play God, but as we enter the 21st century acting as God, we should understand that this does not make us God. One alarming reality of our current biotechnological developments and genetic manipulations is that there is not a single scientist working in this field today who can state with certainty what the effect on other species, the environment, or man himself will be from incorporating these new, genetically contrived creations into nature."

        "text_source": "There can, of course, be genuine value in trying to establish whether some other condition might account for, or exist in addition to, abduction-related symptoms. I have been working recently with a young woman who is struggling to come to terms with both alien abductions and experiences of sexual abuse. Careful interviewing, however, has shown \u00b7 that one set of experiences does not explain the other, and that this woman is quite capable, when given the opportunity, of distinguishing the different effects of each. But evaluations of possible abduction cases should be pursued by physicians and other clinicians who are at least familiar with and open to the reality of the phenomenon, even when they do not \"believe\" in it. There is sufficient information available now in books, popular periodicals, and other media, if not in professional journals, to suggest strongly that something that defies conventional explanation is happening to many people. As Sheila said, there is no excuse \"for an ignorant stance.\" The abduction phenomenon also raises interesting questions about the nature of memory and the control of consciousness. As discussed in chapter 1, prevalence or incidence polls of UFO abductions are rendered almost meaningless by the fact that long forgotten abduction memories may be triggered by an event-Ed's I walk along the coast in Maine, or Arthur's conversation with his sister at a family reunion-the timing of which is itself unpredictable. What are the forces that keep the memory out of consciousness during the years-more than twenty-five in these two cases-during which there is seemingly no recall of the events in question? The abductees themselves feel that something more than simple repression is at work-that some repressing force is imposed by the alien beings themselves. Ed, as I reported, remembers being told that he will remember \"when you need to know.\" Sometimes this not remembering appears to protect the abductees from a distress that they could not handle, especially in the case of children. But we have little understanding of how this repressing force works, or, for that matter, why an altered state of consciousness, facilitated in a caring, protective setting, is so effective in recovering abduction memories. These odd vicissitudes of memory appear to be part of a larger phenomenon. The aliens of these perceived encounters, or some other agent, appear able to control the minds and perceptions of abductees. It is common during abductions that spouses and others who are in the room when the abductee is taken seem to be \"switched off,\" i.e., rendered in some way unconscious during the abduction. This may be quite aggravating to the abductee calling for assistance in his or her helpless distress. This alteration of con- \u00b7 sciousness may be related to the differential perception of UFOs themselves on the part of witnesses. There are reported occasions in which some of the people in a particular setting may not see aUFO that is quite clear to others (Crawford 1993). Research into these matters may, indeed, lead us through new doors of perception. The alien abduction phenomenon appears to have something to teach us about the redemptive and transformational role of emotion in human life. The terror, rage, grief, and, on a few occasions, joy expressed during my sessions with experiencers, are among the most powerful I have ever witnessed. For me and others who have attended the sessions, as well as for the abductees themselves, it is this intensity of recovered emotion that lends inescapable authenticity to the phenomenon. Something, everyone who goes through these sessions agrees, has happened to these people, whether or not it is possible to identify the source of what has occurred. Furthermore, this intense emotion, especially as it is felt and discharged through bodily movements and powerful vocalization, appears to have transformative power, especially when the facilitator can be fully with the experiencer through the course of its most powerful re-evocation. The bodily responses seem quite literally to drive the experience into new realms of psychical awareness. When this occurs an expansion of consciousness or broadening of knowledge becomes possible. Peter, for example, found that it was the very intensity of his bodily experience when reliving his abductions that pennitted-perhaps forced-him to consider the reality of the alien beings themselves, which was a basic step in his spiritual journey. It is possible that experiencing terror, or \"pushing through\" it, is an intrinsic or necessary aspect of breaking the psychological boundaries that limit our perception of reality. When Catherine found that she was able to experience within herself-and express fully to the alien beings-her terror and rage, a more reciprocal, meaningful, and creative relationship with them became possible. Indeed, the alien abduction phenomenon seems to open abductees and those who work with them to deeper realms of human emotion, whether or not that is a specific \"purpose\" of the phenomenon. The abduction phenomenon also seems to offer new perspectives on human destructiveness. The aliens, as illustrated, for example, in Peter 's and Paul's cases, appear to some experiencers as genuinely puzzled about the extent of our aggressiveness toward one another and especially our apparent willingness to destroy the planet's life. As Paul said when speaking from an alien point of view, \"'We don't understand why you choose destruction.\" Indeed, the extent of this destructiveness, as reflected to us from an alien vantage point, demonstrates the inadequacy of our biological and psychological theories of aggression and the need for a fresh look at this aspect of our individual and collective selves. \"An organism that gets to be at such a degree of destruction should flip back and learn upon itself,\" Paul said. As one who has long studied the psychological consequences of the nuclear threat, I can only agree. IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICS, TECHNOLOGY, AND BIOLOGY The first reports of UFOs raised questions for contemporary science, which has dealt with the issue largely by ignoring or denyi ng the whole matter. If, as described in numerous reports, UFOs are spacecraft, how did they get here? What are their propulsion systems? How did they project light and heat of extraordinary intensity over huge distances, or accelerate and change direction in apparent defiance of the laws of gravity? These are questions difficult to address within the parameters of modern physics. The abduction phenomenon has only added new ingredients to old technological puzzles. How, for example, do the aliens pass people through walls? Questions such as this might seem absurd, or suggestive only of observational error or psychosis, to those whose parameters of reality have been limited to our understanding of the physical world as we have known it. Carlos describes the sensation of having his cells vibrate and dissolve as he is transported by a light beam, leaving behind a kind of ghostly shape. B ut exactly what this transformational process consists of we have virtually no knowledge. What is the mechanism whereby cuts and other lesions are apparently healed so promptly? One man told me of a gash several inches deep that appeared on his leg following an abduction experience. Yet he said this cut virtually disappeared in twenty-four hours . What is the process whereby abductees are seemingly tracked, so they can be found whenever and wherever the beings wish? Are implants involved in this? It has been suggested that the aliens are many thousands of years ahead of human beings in their mastery of various technologies. Perhaps so. In any event, we cannot begin to answer any of these questions within the framework of modern science. As is frequently remarked upon in this field, multidisciplinary studies combining physics with comparative religion and spirituality are needed to further consider how the interdimensional bridging properties of the abduction phenomenon might work. PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS When I say that the UFO abduction phenomenon seems to require a shift in our worldview, this may be thought of in two senses. On the one hand the aliens and the UFOs themselves seem, as discussed above, to act in ways that defy accepted laws of physics and principles of biology, requiring that we at least extend our know ledge of the material world before we can understand how UFOs function. But these problems are more or less in the domain of science as it has evolved over the centuries. After all, the capabilities of contemporary space shuttles and electronic communications systems would appear altogether magical if confronted by someone from the Middle Ages. Yet their creation are real accomplishments of science and technology in the Western tradition. But there are more fundamental questions raised by the abduction phenomenon which seem to lie outside the ontological framework of modern science and appear to be unapproachable by its methods. Foremost among these is the problem of defining in what reality the abductions occur. Quite a few abductees have spoken to me of their sense that at least some of their experiences are not occurring within the physical space/time dimensions of the universe as we comprehend it. They speak of aliens breaking through from another dimension, through a \"slit\" or \"crack\" in some sort of barrier, entering our world from \"beyond the veil.\" Abductees, some of whom have little education to prepare them to explain about such abstractions or odd dislocations, will speak of the collapse of space/time that occurs during their experiences. They experience the aliens, indeed their abductions themselves, as happening in another reality, although one that is as powerfully actual to them as--or more so than-the familiar physical world."

        "text_source": "For me and other investigators, abduction research has had a shattering impact on our views of the nature of the cosmos. This has led me to offer at least a parable, if not a theory, to illuminate what is going on. Virtually all peoples throughout history, with the exception of the Western culture of the Newtonian/Cartesian era, have experienced the universe as possessing some sort of intelligence or consciousness in which human beings participate with other animate beings and inanimate things in an enterprise that has meaning, purpose, and direction, however unfathomable these may be. In the West, we seem, for reasons perhaps as mysterious as the abduction phenomenon itself, to have cut ourselves off almost totally from awareness of any form of higher intelligence. But let us suppose that such an intelligence did exist, and, what is more, that it was not indifferent to the fate of the Earth, regarding its life forms and transcendent beauty as one of its better or more advanced creations. And let us imagine that the imbalance created by the overgrowth of certain human faculties, a kind of technodestructive and fear-driven acquisitiveness, were diagnosed (perceived? felt?-we really do not know how the divinity might experience itself and its creation) as the basic problem. What could be done as a corrective? The two natural approaches of which we can conceive would be the genetic and the environmental. Is it possible that through a vast hybridization program affecting countless numbers of people, and a simultaneous invasion of our consciousness with transforming images of our selfdestruction, an effort is being made to place the planet under a kind of receivership? This would not necessarily be for our good if this planet, on which humankind has broken the harmony of being, does not exist just for our pleasure, but in order to arrest the destruction of life and to make possible the further evolution of consciousness or whatever the anima mundi has in store. I do not say that this is true or offer it as a theory. I would merely suggest that if we could allow ourselves to reintroduce the possibility of a higher intelligence into the universe, and experience the numinous mystery of creation, this scenario is consistent with the facts of the abduction phenomenon. David Jacobs has written in this book, No significant body of thought has come about that presents strong evidence that anything else is happening other than what the abductees have stated. He has made his case well and has greatly enriched our knowledge of what the abductees have to tell of their experiences. We must now go on from here."

Appendix 2, \"Astronomers' Sightings\")- This being the case, there appear, upon analysis, to be other, deeper reasons. A general school of thought has existed for close to two centuries that tends to dismiss the idea that terrestrial phenomena could be influenced from the outside. At the start, this was a positive, rational, and creative reaction to ancient beliefs. Compared with ancient times, modern science has, in fact, advanced by eliminating the gods. It would seem counterproductive and incongruous to bring them back in other forms. The idea prevails in almost all minds that man is master of the earth and, by extension, of the immediate cosmic vicinity, that it is the best nature can produce in this small comer of the galaxy, and that he alone remains the controller of his destiny. Various American philosophers have termed this concept \"anthropocentric humanism. \" To admit that intelligent [beings], which are not only outside [our planet] but are also superior due to their scientific and technological knowledge, could have interfered or might continue to interfere in our affairs, in our domain, or in proximity to it, is considered by many to be frightening and unacceptable, because admitting it would cause the collapse of the framework of comfortable thoughts of anthropocentric humanism. Moreover, in some disciplines such as physics, the risk run is to find oneself confronted with a science that is more advanced by several centuries, milleniums, or even more."

As Daniel Fry, a pioneer rocket technician whose first encounter took place in 1949, was informed by his alien contact:  If we were to appear as members of a superior race, coming from above to lead the people of your world, we would seriously disrupt the ego balance of your civilization. Tens of millions of your people, in their desperate need to avoid being demoted to second place in the universe, would go to any conceivable length to disprove or deny our existence. If  we  took  steps  to  force  the  realization  of  our  reality  upon  their consciousness, then about thirty percent of these people would insist upon considering us as gods, and would attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their own welfare. Of the remaining seventy percent, most would consider that we were potential tyrants who were planning to enslave their world, and many would immediately begin to seek means to destroy us. If any great and lasting good is to come from our efforts, the actual leaders must be your own people, or it must come from men who are indistinguishable from them. NON-DISCLOSURE In  November  2011,  two  petitions  with  over  seventeen  thousand  signatories were  sent  to  the  White  House,  one  demanding  immediate disclosure of the government's knowledge of and communications with extraterrestrial beings. Earlier that month, two petitions with similar aims were able together to garner the required number of signatures to gain a response. The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race, responded Phil Larson from the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy. In addition, there is no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye. While conceding the possibility of aliens and a variety of NASA projects aimed at searching for them, Larson stressed there was no credible evidence of extraterrestrial presence here on Earth."

        "text_source": "Alan responded: It is difficult even to outline, in a few minutes of discussion, the events of many centuries. For it has been centuries since we have called any planet home. The space ships upon which we live, and work and learn, have been our only home for generations. Like all space-dwelling races, we are now essentially independent of planets. Some of our craft are very large, judged by your standards, since they are many times larger than your largest ships. We have no personal need to approach or land upon any planet, except occasionally to obtain raw materials for new construction, and that we usually obtain from asteroids or uninhabited satellites [moons]. Our ships are closed systems. That is, all matter within the craft remains there; nothing is emitted, ejected or lost from it. We have learned simple methods of reducing all compounds to their elements, and for recombining them in any form . . . For example, we breathe in the same manner as you do. That is, our lungs take in oxygen from the air, and some of that oxygen is converted to carbon-dioxide in the body processes. Therefore, the air in our ship is constantly passed through solutions which contain plant-like organisms which absorb carbon-dioxide, use the carbon in their own growth, and return the oxygen to the air. Eventually those plants become one of our foods . It may be difficult for you to conceive of a race of intelligent beings who spend all of their lives within the relatively restricted confines of a space ship. You may even be inclined to feel pity for such a race. We, on the other hand, are inclined to feel pity for the relatively primitive races which are still confined to the surface of a single planet, where they are unable to control . . . earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, tidal waves, blizzards, drought, and a dozen other hazards . While our bodies seldom leave the ship, our technology has provided us with almost unlimited extensions of our senses so that ... we can be intimately present at any time and at any place which we may choose, providing that the place is within a few thousand miles of our ship. Through a portion of our technology which your race has not yet begun to acquire, we are able to generate and apply simple forces at points quite remote from our craft. Our abilities may be somewhat startling and incredible to some of your people but they are not actually as startling and incredible as the scientific knowledge and abilities your people now have, compared to those which your ancestors possessed a few hundred years ago . . .  A COMMON ANCESTRY  Alan explained that the symbol of the tree and the serpent was not unique to Earth. It is a natural one, 'perhaps because life is said to originate in the waters of a planet, and the undulations of a serpent are a convenient symbol for the waves of a sea. The tree is almost always the symbol of life, beginning in the sea, rising to the atmosphere, and finally into space.' But there was another factor, he added, that perhaps was significant."

        "text_source": "There is a problem for Earthlings. Within hours of the crash at Roswell, US General Twining designated the visitors as 'enemy aliens'. It appears ... that it has remained as official US policy ever since. At that time, however, it was an enemy about which the US could do nothing, because the visitors were so technically superior ... The rationale was that ordinary people couldn't cope with the news and might easily panic. Reference was made to Orson Welles' Halloween broadcast [October 1938] depicting a Martian invasion, which had been so realistic that a sort of panic ensued. The best way to prevent a recurrence was to keep the public in the dark ... This policy resulted in what has probably been the greatest and most successful cover-up in the history of the world. But much has happened in the more than half-century that policy was adopted. The most important change has been in US military capability. The US has developed the aliens' own weapons - lasers and particle guns - to the point where they can be used against the visitors from space ... The Bush Administration has finally agreed to let the military build a forward base on the Moon [in 2018], which will put them in a better position to keep track of the goings and comings of the visitors from space, and to shoot at them, if they so decide .. ,23 I must emphasize here that not all alien species are hostile. It is evident that some appear to be millennia ahead of us in terms of their ethical development. Yet, evidently, we are in conflict with some races. Given that the universe appears to be teeming with life at different stages of evolution, we should not be surprised. Furthermore, I have long subscribed to the hypothesis that Homo sapiens is a genetically modified species, deriving from the colonization of Earth by an alien race millennia ago. Some of these races, in my view, are still based here. The centuries-old phenomena prevalent in certain areas of our planet such as the Bermuda Triangle - disappearances, space-time warps and so on - indicate the existence of highly advanced technology. And it would appear that our presence in or near these areas is not always welcomed. As I revealed in Unearthly Disclosure, based on information provided by a high-ranking source in the late 1980s, some aliens posed a threat to the environment because they were 'messing around with tectonic plates' in the Pacific Ocean, and 'the presence of the alien ships in our oceans was causing - or at least contributing to - the warming of the waters'. Supposedly, the aliens had been requested by those few in the military who had access to them to vacate their undersea bases. The request was ignored. Further compounding the issue, there appeared to be a conflict of interests between resident alien races here on Earth. Are we, as a number of sources claim, already at war with some of these beings? Robin Cole, cited in Chapter 10 in connection with his research into the involvement in UFO monitoring by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), which liaises hand-in-glove with its American counterpart, the National Security Agency, relates a telling comment by a GCHQ Signals Intelligence analyst in the 1990s. 'I've got something really serious to tell you,' she told her brother on returning home from work one day. 'We've known for years that we're at war with these beings.' No further details were given.24 Anecdotal it may be, but the woman appeared very concerned. In my opinion, the US Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is the military unit charged with the operation to counter an alien threat. 'Ladies and Gentleman, the war in space has begun,' announced General Lance W. Lord, Commander of AFSPC, at an international conference in 2004. 'Space superiority for us has got to be something we work [at] very hard, and has to be considered equally as important as air superiority. '25 He didn't mention aliens, of course, but his comments are apposite, nonetheless. In 2002, Gary McKinnon was arrested in London under the Computer Misuse Act for having hacked (with relative ease) into numerous military networks, specifically to uncover information being withheld by the US Government on UFOs. No charges were brought against him, but in 2005 he faced extradition proceedings by the US Government. Currently (June 2006), the case is the subject of an extradition request which has successfully, so far, gone through the initial court process and is now the subject of an appeal. If extradited, McKinnon faces up to sixty years in a US jail."

Still, the story resonates with me, simply because I know the source, as well as a few things about the career of this officer. Consider what eons and eons might mean. After Disclosure, these other beings are still likely to be so far ahead of us that open contact between us and them, open communication of any sort, might well remain inconceivable. The irony of Disclosure could well be that we will continue to have many unanswered questions about exactly who and what we are dealing with. We will have gotten to a point where we can prove to ourselves openly as a society that they are here, yes. But that is different from being able to grab hold of a live one for open study. Fighting the black budget world would probably offer the most hope on this matter, but it may well take an extended struggle to make that happen, perhaps many years. It is also quite possible that whatever bodies are being held make up only a small piece of the grand puzzle of what constitutes these Others. Very likely, the real action after Disclosure will be dealing with issues internal to our own society. It may well be that at least some of these beings have established a residence on our world. There is certainly reason to believe, gained from countless insider leaks and claims, that there is communication of some sort between them and the black budget community. There are also claims, and good reason to consider, that some of them have insinuated themselves into our society, perhaps even our power structure. Why would that be so illogical? On the contrary, it would seem to be entirely logical. They would know that humanity is on the fast track, and that when we get to the point where we might prove to be a genuine annoyance, all the more reason for them to have their own people on the inside. In the post-Disclosure world, this question will be raised more than once. There will be no easy way around it. Disclosure of the UFO reality will force our civilization to resolve many longstanding challenges and problems. Looking at only a few of these, it is easy to see why secrecy on this matter has been paramount for so long. Uncovering it will be the most revolutionary act in human history. The Long View   Looking further ahead into the future, we can discern some contours of that distant shore. It will be a world with an open recognition of the presence of other, alien intelligences here on Earth, interacting with this planet and humanity. That will be out in the open. Whether they will be out in the open is another matter altogether. But its open acknowledgement will be a great spur to our intellectual development. The dominant technologies a century from now will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to recognize today. Computing power and artificial intelligence will be orders of magnitude greater. Human beings themselves are likely to be different in many ways. Placing a value judgement on this is probably pointless. For better or worse, we are on the cusp of a great change. We will see changes not merely to our technological infrastructure, but probably to our own species via gene therapy and other forms of biotech. The basic intelligence of at least a portion of humanity (the very well-to-do) is likely to increase greatly. Envisioning the future in such a world is difficult. In all likelihood, we will still have families, love relationships, and a physical need for food, sleep, and sex. On that basis, we may assume that humans a century from now will share basic traits with us. Yet, how much do we have in common today with a medieval peasant or a paleolithic hunter-gatherer? Certain things, yes, but we also inhabit a vastly different mental universe. It seems likely that our great-great grandchildren, at least some of them, will be that far ahead of us."

        "text_source": "Whereas Hopkins and Jacobs tended to view abductions as an assault by extraterrestrial beings upon humanity, Mack did not. He observed that many abductees believed that they had gained greater spiritual awareness or insights as a result of their experiences, which benefit humanity's continued evolution. In other words, contact between human and non-human extraterrestrial intelligences could have positive outcomes. Like other abduction researchers, Mack noted the apparent telepathic communication between aliens and abductees. But out of this, he drew a new conclusion: this communication appeared to be instrumental in altering human consciousness. This direct mind-to-mind communication was not especially pleasant. It involved implanting horrible images such as environmental disasters, earthquakes, or other catastrophes. The aliens seemed to be monitoring the response of the abductee and sometimes provided information about when a future disaster would occur. The mental connection was not always about disasters, though. It could simply be the transmission of some piece of information that spurred the abductee to grow in some way. As an example, Scott, one of the subjects in Mack's book Abduction, had been a skeptic on the matter of extraterrestrials, but then was humiliated to recall how beings had laid him on a table and used various wires to stimulate sexual arousal and ejaculation. In his words, all of this was in order to make babies. [285] He felt violated and angry that the beings were controlling his memories and messing with his head. On another occasion, he was shown cylinders with tiny babies, presumably from his sperm. He was also taken to an underground facility, where he saw that the alien beings were something like an extended family to him, in the sense that they knew everything about him. Indeed, they knew more about him than any human family would have known. Scott learned, somehow, that these beings were in the process of changing themselves physically so that they could breathe on Earth. This is a key part of the hybridization process, he said. He also observed that they think much faster than humans do. During telepathic communication, he said, they need to slow down in order not to overwhelm us. Scott believed that their intention was to live on Earth, but possibly without humanity-unless humanity were to change, in which case we might live together. Scott contrasted human and alien existence. Human beings, he said, are alone. They do not share their thoughts, or much of anything. Among the aliens, conversely, nobody is alone, there are no secrets. Everybody knows everything. Based on his recalled experiences, Scott concluded that if humanity does not change, our world will change for us. Disturbing though these recalled memories were, they spurred Scott to become more aware of the need to protect the Earth, of finding ways to explore and expand his own thinking and consciousness, and of fundamentally becoming a better person. Thus, while Mack agreed with other researchers that abduction experiences are often traumatic, and even appear cruel at times, he believed it could still be spiritually transformative. He saw no inconsistency in this, unless, as he put it, one reserves spirituality for realms of the sublime that are free of pain and struggle. Going on, he wrote, sometimes our most useful spiritual learning and growth comes at the hands of rough teachers who have little respect for our conceits, psychological defenses, or established points of view. In effect, suggested Mack, the abduction process has the potential to free our minds. In the first place, acknowledging the very existence of these other beings, after the initial shock, may be the first step in the opening of consciousness to a universe that is no longer simply material. Abductees come to appreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itself intelligent. This was why Mack often used the less value-laden term, experiencer, instead of abductee, to describe these individuals. His impression was that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. He came to the belief that the phenomenon is fundamentally about the preservation of life on earth, at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. Throughout his life, Mack kept his mind open to the possibilities of what humanity is facing, and even questioned whether these beings were actually extraterrestrial. He never made the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) his definite conclusion. He wrote that they come from a source that remains unknown to us.\" The Other Side of Contact   From here we move to the other side of contact. It is a side with a much longer pedigree than alien abduction, at least insofar as how long it has been discussed. This is intentional contact by humans with nonhuman entities, whether they be conceived as extraterrestrial or otherwise. The idea is ancient. What is a shaman, after all, but someone who makes contact with entities from another realm in order to provide guidance or protection for their own society? Even the neighborhood priest comes from a long history of spiritual masters and adepts whose job was to serve as the receptacle for the divine or holy spirit in order to bring enlightenment, or at least guidance, to the people. In essence, such endeavors are no different from contemporary claims of channeling extraterrestrial beings. Whatever it may be that is happening during such an experience, no answer is going to satisfy everyone. The idea of communicating in this manner with extraterrestrials (as specific from other types of entities such as ghosts or divine beings) seems to date to the 18th century, when the philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg claimed to have done this telepathically. Then, during the 1870s, the mystic Helena Blavatsky claimed to have done the same. A few decades later, Aleister Crowley, after performing sexual rituals and taking opium, engaged in a state of meditation something like self-induced hypnosis. He also claimed to have contacted an extraterrestrial being, although in this case not merely in a spiritual manner, but physically. In fact, he drew a picture of this being, whom he said was named Lam. Lam had a large head and bears a passing resemblance to large-headed alien grays."

        "text_source": "11.2.1 Flight Crew The flight crew is naturally involved, particularly the pilots, because whether they are civilian or military, they are in a more advantageous position for making sightings and would be the first affected in the event of an incident (risk of collision, in particular). This is especially true for a combat pilot, because he is trained to constantly monitor the sky and he now has more and more advanced weapons systems capable of detecting faster and faster and smaller and smaller targets at greater and greater distances. The pilot/weapons system pair is now more than ever an excellent sighting instrument and would be our first means of intervention if, by chance, this were to prove necessary. The concerns of a commercial airline pilot are different because, in addition to the fact that he does not have the same equipment, his priority is obviously the safety of his passengers. Although he remains a primary partner in the quest for information, he would be totally powerless in the face of an aggressive stance by a UFO. 11.2.2 [Air Traffic] Controllers The [air traffic] controller is, of course, involved, but depending on whether he is civilian or military, the control equipment at his disposal offer him different options. In both cases, since he is in radio contact with the pilot, it is he who is the first to receive the sighting report from the crew. He must be prepared to note and supplement the sightings transmitted with the clear-headedness that the distance of his position gives him. In regard to radar detection, only the military controller has adequate equipment to detect a flying object that does not follow general air traffic rules. In fact, military air defense radars permit a visual display of the primary detection, as well as a synthetic display used by civilian [air traffic] controllers, to appear on the military controller's radar scope (see Appendix 1). In addition, they are the only ones who are able to obtain an image of craft moving at the supposed speeds of UFOs. Finally, the means to record and reconstruct radar situations on site at the Control and Detection Centers (CDC) enable supplemental investigations to be conducted, if necessary. 11.2.3 Meteorologists Unusual phenomena are often explained by meteorological phenomena. Questions can easily be explained if the specialized departments are informed of the importance of their observations. All military and civilian personnel specializing in meteorology must therefore be able to meet this expectation. 11.2.4 CNES Engineers CNES engineers are the French space specialists. They cannot remain indifferent to UFO phenomena. Knowledge of our universe, observation of the sky, and surveillance of anything that is deployed into the sky naturally makes them just the right people to head up the study of extraterrestrial phenomena. We have described their work above. 11.2.5 Engineers in the Aeronautics Sector Engineers in the aeronautic sector are naturally involved. Their work is presented in the next chapter on scientific and technical implications. 11.3 How Do We Involve Aeronautics [Personnel]? In order for aeronautics personnel, along with their resources, to be involved, we need to know how to interest them and, in order to do this, how to inform them of the phenomenon, to specify what is expected of them, and to define what their reflex responses should be and what course of action they should take. 11.3.1 Informing Personnel Informing amounts, first and foremost, to getting someone to accept the possibility of the presence of extraterrestrial craft in our sky. It is necessary to overcome the fear of ridicule and to admit that, failing certainty, there are strong presumptions based on a list of examples selected from among the testimonies from the aeronautics world. Moreover, it is necessary to reach all generations. Informational conferences can be easily scheduled at aeronautics schools for the young generations (Ecole de l'Air, Ecole Rationale de F Aviation Civile [National Civil Aviation School] (ENAC. Sup'Aero, etc. ), and for the not-so-young, in continuing education courses and, obviously, at the College Interarmees de Defense [Interarmy Defense College] (CID) and IHEDN. SEPRA is already holding conferences at ENAC within the framework of civilian [air traffic] controller training. This practice just needs to be extended to all flight crew training schools, regardless of the specialty being taught. For the generations already on the job, these conferences can easily be offered at the Control and Detection Centers and flight units for military personnel, and, at least for civilian [air traffic] controllers, at the Regional Air Navigation Centers (CNRA). As for commercial flight crews, the airline companies - Air France, in particular - have set up a systematic information sheet for crews that is periodically updated. This information must furthermore be updated on a regular basis in the knowledge that the intended objective is to permit a future witness, whether he plays an active role or is merely an observer, to be fully aware of what course of action to take in the face of the phenomenon sighted. If we want personnel to get involved, it is necessary that they know how to react in real time and what to communicate and to whom, how to take the measures corresponding to the present situation, etc. For this reason, it is advisable to define with them what their reflex responses should be and what course of action they should take. 11.3.2 Reflex Responses In fact, it is necessary to instill in personnel who are brought face to face with the phenomenon what their reflex responses should be, in the knowledge that they may merely be simple observers or, in some cases, have to take concrete measures (for example, at San Carlos de Bariloche, the surprise of the landing strip lights going out in the middle of the UFO incident). It is quite certain that it would be better to be prepared in order to be fully aware of what course of action to take in the face of such an unforeseen and poorly understood event. These reflex responses differ in type depending on whether it is a matter of sighting, recording a testimony, transmitting information collected, or reacting in real time in order to take ad hoc measures in response to the phenomenon. 11.3.3 Course of Action to Take The course of action to take seems to us to be summarized as follows: observe, note the maximum amount of details, take photographs if possible, make a report, allowing the visitors the initiative of possibly making contact, and avoid premature publicity in the media. 11.3 3.1 Objective Observation In the face of an unknown situation, one must be on guard against any instinctive self-defense reaction that could be easily interpreted as a provocation. One must just observe and avoid any initiative aimed at seeking contact. 11.3.3.2 Reporting Once a phenomenon has been sighted, it is advisable to report it in order to alert the other crews, on the one hand, which is what is currently done, and the authorities, on the other hand, through the air [traffic] control chain of command in civilian cases and the air defense chain of command in military cases. 11.3.3.3 Remaining Discrete Vis-a-Vis the Public As a witness to a phenomenon of this type, one must know how to adopt a certain level of discretion vis-a-vis the press. It is essential to allow scientists [time] to make use of the information before letting the media trigger the curiosity of the general public, which could result in the disappearance of important evidence."

        "text_source": "We may even have to face the fact that the scientific framework, by its very internal logic, excludes certain classes of phenomena, of which UFOs may be one. One of the most exasperating and even repugnant features of the subject is its apparent irrationality. However, as our concept of rationality is a by-product of the scientifically oriented society in which we live, it should not surprise us if a phenomenon that is inaccessible to scientific procedure appears irrational. It is just here that we encounter a second difficulty of the UFO problem. It cannot, at least at present, be separated from the social condition in which it is embedded. We are accustomed to the almost complete isolation of the behavioral sciences from the physical sciences, yet in this problem we have a situation in which the two are inextricably mixed. Whether or not separate, nontrivial physical and behavioral components will emerge as serious study by both disciplines remains to be seen, but it would be premature to reduce the importance of either. Of course, this discussion would be unnecessary if an obvious explanation of UFOs was at hand. In one's frustration it is all too easy to seize on an explanation of the 'men from Mars' variety and to ignore the many UFO features unaccounted for. But to do this is to fall into the very trap we have just discussed. We may be inadvertently and artificially increasing the significance of the conspicuous features while the part we ignore - or that which is not reported by the untrained witnesses - may contain the clue to the whole subject. What needs to be explained has been amply outlined in the descriptions of the six basic UFO observational prototypes given in Chapters Six through Eleven. The most persistent and enigmatic features seem to be the localization of the phenomenon in space and time, its apparently intelligent characteristics (of a rather puerile kind), its appearance of operating outside the established laws of physics, and its peculiar preferences for certain situations. The frequently reported presence of 'humanoids' capable of moving about in comfort in our highly restrictive terrestrial environment, and their association with 'craft', exhibiting at times near-zero inertial mass yet able to leave physical traces of their presence, is surely a phenomenon beyond the pale of mid-twentieth century physics. But there will surely be, we hope, a twenty-first century science and a thirtieth century science, and perhaps they will encompass the UFO phenomenon as twentieth century science has encompassed the aurora borealis, a feat unimaginable to nineteenth century science, which likewise was incapable of explaining how the sun and stars shine. We work in the brilliant spotlight of the present, only dimly conscious of the penumbra of the past and quite unable to illuminate the darkness of the future. Let us imagine for a moment a covered wagon train of not much more than a century ago, winding its long journey to the west. It is encamped for the night, its wagons in a circle, sentries posted, and the travelers gathered about a campfire for warmth and cheer. Someone speaks of the future, but he speaks, as he must, with the words and concepts of his day. But even were he inspired by some kindly muse of the future to speak of making their entire journey in a matter of hours, flying through the air, and of watching scenes by television and hearing voices speaking on another continent, this gifted one could not have put into words a glimmer of how these wondrous things might be accomplished. The vocabulary for such descriptions - electrons, transistors, integrated circuits, jet engines - the jargon vehicle of technical communications would not yet exist for yet a century. He would be helplessly incoherent for want of words as vehicles for his thoughts. Would one care to venture a guess at the technical vocabulary of the year 373,475 (assuming intelligent life still exists on earth) and to predict the concepts and knowledge for which it will be a vehicle? Does such an advanced knowledge and technology already exist somewhere in space? The sun, our parent star, is but one star out of billions in our galaxy, and our galaxy is but one of many millions, each with its billions of stars. It is statistically improbable that our sun is the only star out of quadrillions of stars to have planets. That would be somewhat like claiming that acorns can be found lying near only one oak tree in the world. Even if we limit our thinking to the billions of stars in our galaxy alone, we know that our galaxy was in existence for billions of years before our sun appeared. Thus the stage was set long ago for this possibility, the possibility of civilizations as greatly advanced beyond us as we are beyond mice. For instance, Fred Hoyle1 has conjectured that it is possible that a great intragalactic communications network exists but that we are like a settler in the wilderness who as yet has no telephone. Such ideas, once forbidding and even revolting to our geo centric minds, no longer shock us as we slowly grow out of ou cosmic provincialism. Such concepts, however, have little to da directly with our problem at the moment save that they presenl one possible hypothesis for study. But talk of extraterrestria visitors or the more esoteric notions of time travel or of parallel universes is as inappropriate as the mass hallucination hypothesis for UFOs at this stage. Kuhn has commented that] scientific progress tends to be revolutionary rather than evol-j utionary, and the above concepts are, despite their bizarre nature, merely imaginative extensions of current concepts. When the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, I believe that it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science but a mighty and totally unexpected quantum jump.

But, today, while both our technology and our consciousness have risen to a point where the two races might work together, we humans have almost wrecked this world through pollution and deforestation. The Martians see no humor in the irony of being forced to abandon their planet due to cosmic accident, and now seeing their hopes for Earth being dashed due to our primitive ignorance. This situation may explain why the remote viewers say the Martians consider humans to be inferior to themselves, much as most adults tend to discount the worth of children. But they also realize that mutual cooperation between the races might vastly improve both's survival prospects. They are also well aware that man's technology has reached the capability to categorically detect their activity. They are taking steps to postpone this eventuality. Asked if these Martians are trying to take over the earth, Morehouse replied, We don't think so. If that was their purpose, they could have done it years ago, before we developed the technology to resist. I think they are biding their time, hoping that human consciousness will evolve enough to accept the idea of sharing the planet with them. I mean, look how the races of man can't get along. What would happened if everyone suddenly became aware that Martians were among us? No, I think we still have further to travel on the evolutionary scale. Some of the viewers believe that, for now, the Martians are simply using the earth for necessary raw materials. That's where the UFOs come in. Many are shuttle craft used to transport certain chemical fertilizers-especially potash-plasticizers, milk, and other natural resources back to the survivors on Mars. This work is being done with the assistance of specialized organic beings that have become known as the greys. Several remote viewers claim the Martians are not responsible for human abductions. They state that Martian activity on Earth is not connected with the abductions, which appear to be a much more esoteric-even metaphysical-experience involving the Transcendentals. However, the greys do seem to be somewhat involved in abductions. They appear to be assisting the Martians, yet are also responsible for certain human abductions. The impression received by some viewers is that they may be members of some sort of intergalactic Red Cross-or, more correctly, they seem to be conducting something akin to an oversight role, like a United Nations peacekeeping force. According to some remote viewers, the greys are working to save the Martians, who have underground bases on Mars and Earth and who are being monitored by the Transcendental energy beings. They all apparently interact. But there's little doubt that the Transcendentals are the ones in charge-at least on Earth missions. They, in turn, seem to be carrying out orders from some controlling authority located at a distant point beyond our own galaxy. It's as if they have a job to do and they are doing it with scant regard to our presence or desires. They seem very professional. The theme of this synthesis of remote viewing reports was echoed in 1996 with the publication of Cosmic Voyage by Dr. Courtney Brown, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta, who studied remote viewing under a former member of the army's psi spies unit. After several RV sessions, Brown wrote, There are [emphasis in the original] Martians on Earth, but one must think clearly about the implications of this before ringing the alarm bell. These Martians are desperate. Apparently they have very crude living quarters on Mars. They cannot live on the surface. Their children have no future on their homeworld. Their home is destroyed; it is a planet of dust."

        "text_source": "Apart from popular entertainment, however, UFOs have had other influences on our culture, mostly as a result of the cover-up. Most of these influences have been negative. For if we assume that UFOs are real, and there has been a cover-up, then it would be a cover-up that has permeated our society at nearly every level. It would mean that a major truth in our world has been suppressed, which in turn has damaged the willingness and ability of many people to investigate and see truth when it does appear. After all, if someone is used to taking the word of the established authorities on a particular subject, even when the facts do not agree, it can cause a disconnect or discrepancy between what one thinks reality is, and what it really is. The cover-up, however, may have produced one silver lining. We like to think of our species as able to handle the open acknowledgment of UFOs and other beings, but what if we really cannot, at least not without a serious crisis? This might especially be the case if we were to learn that there is some unpleasantness to the presence of these Others. If that is so, then we might conclude that the cover-up has preserved human culture to some extent, rather than allowing it to disintegrate within panic. I do not personally subscribe to this belief, but it is worth consideration. As substantial as the cultural impact of UFOs has been on our world so far, it is likely to be dwarfed by the end of the secrecy that envelops it. This has been something I have reflected on for some time. What I see is something no less than a replay of the 1960s, a decade when anything and everything seemed possible, when people developed a powerful distrust of their government, when they explored an array of alternative realities. This time, however, such a transformation will occur within the social and technological frameworks of the 21st century. A wild ride indeed. Because the major fact, sitting front row and center, will be the challenge, whether benign, benevolent or hostile, posed by the reality of highly advanced other beings here among us on Planet Earth. Global Implications   When we try to look further ahead into the post-Disclosure world, which is the theme of this book's final chapter, we arrive at the likelihood of political revolution. Whether or not this ultimately will be something positive for mankind is not something I would care to predict. If prior revolutions are our guide, the post-Disclosure Revolution will probably usher in developments both beneficial and malign. Clearly, though, a major alteration of human politics will be necessary on a global scale. This will be not merely in order to cope with these other beings, whoever they are and whatever they want, but also to deal with the new technologies that undoubtedly will arise in the aftermath. Quite probably, too, from the demands laid down by the people themselves for a new and, it is to be hoped, more open and transparent political system. Disclosure may be the signal to lay down an open form of global fascism, but it does not have to be that way. In the very long run, after Disclosure, humanity and our home Planet Earth will look very different than they do today. After all, we are already on an incredible trajectory. The disclosure of an extraterrestrial reality would only hasten the best of that. For better or for worse, ending the Big Secret will put us on the fast track."

        "text_source": "By the same token, the breakthroughs and world concepts of the future probably would be unthinkable and certainly bewildering if we could now glimpse them. Yet changes in their proper time do occur, and it therefore behooves us to study seriously, not dismiss with scathing ridicule, the puzzling phenomena of today in the hope of coming upon satisfactory explanations. We may thus venture into the future, so to speak. The UFO phenomenon may well be one such challenging area of interest even though it is seemingly out of place in our present world picture - as incredible to us as television would have been to Plato. The study of this frequently reported phenomenon may offer us an enticing glimpse of and point a beckoning finger to the future. Occasionally scientists sense the presence of the intangible, awesome domain of the unknown. Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists who ever lived, was one who did:    I do not know what I may appear to the world] but to myself  I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and  diverting myself, now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean Of truth lay all undiscovered before me. More often philosophers sense the limitations of the present more quickly than do scientists, absorbed as the latter are in their immediate problems. The philosopher William James pointedly remarked upon the restrictive views of the 'establishment' of his day (1895), particularly as manifested among his colleagues at Harvard:  There is included in human nature an ingrained naturalism and materialism of mind which can only admit facts that are actually tangible. Of this sort of mind the entity called 'Science' is the idol. Fondness for the word 'scientist' is one of the notes by which you may know its votaries; and its short way of killing any opinion that it disbelieves in is to call it 'unscientific'. It must be granted that there is no slight excuse for this. Science has made such glorious leaps in the last 300 years ... that it is no wonder if the worshippers of Science lose their heads. In this very University, accordingly, I have heard more than one teacher say that all the fundamental conceptions of truth have already been found by Science, and that the future has only the details of the picture to fill in. But the slightest reflection on the real conditions will suffice to show how barbaric such notions are. They show such a lack of scientific imagination that it is hard to see how one who is actively advancing any part of Science can make a statement so crude. Think how many absolutely new scientific conceptions have arisen in our generation, how many new problems have been formulated that were never thought of before, and then cast an eye upon the brevity of Science's career. Is this credible that such a mushroom knowledge, such a growth overnight at this, can represent more than the minutest glimpse of what the universe will really prove to be when adequately understood? No! Our Science is but a drop, our ignorance a sea. Whatever else be certain, this at least is certain: that the world of our present natural knowledge is enveloped in a larger world of some sort, of whose residual properties we at present can frame no positive idea. Three quarters of a century have passed since William James berated his Harvard colleagues; time has fully vindicated him. Though he could hardly have suspected it, the year 1895 was to be the first of 'the thirty years that shook physics', that saw relativity, quantum mechanics, and many associated new concepts uproot the tenets of classical physics that were accepted by all physicists as the very rock foundation of the physical universe. The growth of our knowledge and technology has been exponential, yet we must say, unless we are both purblind and unutterably smug, that our ignorance is still a sea."

        "text_source": "In the case of the Washburns' red photos, though, the radiation explanation doesn't fully explain the situation: There is no fogging or overall image blurring or distortion. In the background, although redtinted, the trees stand straight and the land and water horizon lines extend from border to border in each shot. It's only the posed family that's missing. Researcher Marc Davenport has suggested a possible time-warping field effect on the camera that would slow down or speed up the shutter.8 That explanation would be consistent with some scientists' idea that the UFO has found a way to actually pull time-space along with its field. If that phenomenon affects the camera, it also would affect Sam Washburn, standing below the hovering UFO. If provable one day by mainstream science, the theory would also account for Sam's sense that everything had been slowed down-that he was, in effect, in a sort of time warp. And he's far from alone in expressing this odd sense of slow motion, as if his own body had been out of phase with the surrounding time-space. Many abductees report that, at the beginning of an abduction, they seemed to be moving in slow motion-that something didn't feel right. Extreme stress, of course, is one obvious explanation for this sense of time distortion. It's also possible that the physical slowing down of light, or the altering of its energy, has something to do with what Budd has termed missing time-a consistent element of abductees' reports. None of this offers any complete explanation for the Washburns' family photos. But one possibility remains: If the four people were indeed progressively enveloped in a near-infrared plasma, and then an infrared ionized beam that could be finely focused, it is logical that, in the photos, we would be able to see the background trees and the lake, but not the cloaked family. They would be hidden from the visible spectrum of light-the one that average consumer film was designed to capture. Mission Control: Possible Alien Use of Infrared Technologies NASA's Observation Education Reference Model, available online, tells us that the infrared portion of the spectrum is one of the most useful tools for identifying what a surface is made of, because any surface both reflects energy and emits energy. For instance, a plant will reflect much more energy in the infrared range than in the visible range. An aerial explorer can learn a great deal about plants-and rocks, minerals, and human beings, for that matter- from their reflected energy. The occupants of a UFO, hovering low, sometimes shooting far out into space, would have ample opportunity to do an amazing amount of reconnaissance about the state of individuals, countries, and entire planets. Color infrared films, originally designed for aerial photography and reconnaissance missions, are now being used to monitor pollution of air and water or surveying forests to determine their state of health. It doesn't require much of a leap of imagination to suppose that visitors or explorers from other worlds would also find similar useful purposes for heavy investment in the infrared spectrum. Paralysis and Direct Communication to the Brain Two of the most common elements in abduction reports are the sense that the abductee is being told what to do by some voice, and his or her temporary paralysis. The biggest questions here are whether that source of manipulation is coming from inside or outside the self-and how we might explain particular sensations and their actual, physical effects on the abductee. When Sam Washburn tells Budd that he's supposed to take the family photos, we don't know with any certainty whether that voice is coming from his superego, his wife's wishes, his own fear or guilt about their troubled marriage, or from the occupants of the craft vectoring in on them. What we can infer from the four redtinted photos with landscapes but no family in three of them is that Sam evidently did as he had been told, lining up the family and then snapping the photos just after his wife and children were levitated up into the UFO. Of course mind control, if that's what it is, isn't a new idea. From the beginning of recorded history, humans have heard gods commanding from on high and have obeyed. Research shows that governments have also long been interested in getting such a prompt and respectful response from their populace, when needed. There is documentation that throughout the Cold War, our own government has more than dipped a toe into the dark waters of mind control. Type acoustic psycho-correction or psychtronics into your search engine and see what turns up: 1. At Walter Reed Hospital in 1973, Dr. Joseph Sharp participated in an experiment with pulsed microwave audiogram. Sharp sat in a soundproof room, while electronic signals were broadcast toward him in the frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM) that carries microwaves-ordinarily inaudible to humans. There was no receiver, no electronic translation device. Yet, in a direct transmission to his brain, Dr. Sharp clearly made out specific words.9 How was that possible? The microwaves, causing microscopic thermal expansion of the brain tissue, had apparently directly stimulated the area of the brain that processes language. The human ear's need for an audible pulse with a lower frequency and longer wavelength was entirely bypassed. 2. A 1993 article in American Defense News discusses a Russian mind-control technology, called acoustic psycho-correction. Apparently demonstrated in laboratory experiments since the mid-seventies, the technology, say the magazine's sources, could be used to suppress riots, control dissidents, demoralize or disable opposing forces and enhance the performance of friendly special operations teams. In 1991, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Janet Morris, defense consultant to the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army, was invited to Russia to assess possible commercial applications for the technologies. She and her team witnessed a demonstration of acoustic psycho-correction, (mind control technology) that Morris, an expert in the field of nonlethal weaponry, found quite intriguing. She described it as infrasound, very low frequency-type transmission in which the message is transmitted via bone conduction. . . . An entire body protection system would be required to stop reception. The Russians stated that the message bypasses the person's conscious mind but is acted upon in less than a minute. (A frightening thought, but you do have to wonder about the validity of this report. With the godlike powers of mind control at their disposal, how is it that Russia is in its present state of dishevelment? Was it the fledgling capitalism or was it the technology that didn't pan out?) 3. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) also appears to have been interested in the direct broadcasting of audible sound and voice to the human brain. In 1961, Allen Frey, a biophysicist working for the DIA, reportedly experimented with the concept that human beings are capable of hearing microwave broadcasts. He advocated the idea of learning to stimulate the nervous system without the damage caused by electrodes. But, for UFO researchers, the most startling part of his report came next. It was almost a throwaway line. In his experiments, Frey said, subjects experienced the intercranial microwave transmissions as humming, buzzing or knocking sounds.11 As we will see in cases to follow, especially in the case of Anne-Marie, abductees often hear a humming or buzzing sound in their heads just prior to an abduction. We can speculate that they are either hearing the UFO's power plant as the craft approaches, or the craft's occupants are transmitting messages of some kind directly into the abductees' brains. As to abductee paralysis, it could be caused by muscular contractions from electric shock-possibly a general by-product of the UFO power plants' electromagnetic effect that stalls vehicles and stops watches or by a more deliberately targeted and aimed form of shock to the human electrical impulses. We simply don't know. What we do know is that abductees regularly report paralysis before and during the abduction. In many reports, the person is temporarily paralyzed by a light beam or object held in the alien's hand. Richard M. Neal, Jr., M.D., hypothesizes that this effect is caused by a selective type of microwave irradiation [unknown to us] . . . [that sets up] a chain reaction in the Central Nervous System to affect only certain areas and spare those that are essential to vital biological functions. Simulating Human Reality Our alien visitors have earthly company in their interest in these technologies. Today's scientists are also experimenting with direct stimulation of the human sense organs. Often this work is done in conjunction with that of creating virtual reality systems, such as a flight simulator, where a pilot learns to fly a B-52 without ever leaving the ground. Many versions of such systems exist today, from simulated road race games to war game virtual reality projects sponsored by the Pentagon. This is not just television-watching with a new name. A true virtual reality system is one in which the participant actually enters into the system and touches objects, smells lavender or ocean air, and feels herself stride or float toward the sound of a rock concert just around the corner. The entire scenario would be achieved via artificial stimulation of her senses by electrodes worn on the body. Physicist David Deutsch suggests that we might already be living in a massive virtual reality system without knowing it. He states that sight, sound, smell, taste, weightlessness, and all other senses can, in principle, be rendered artificially: Eventually it will become possible to bypass the sense organs altogether and directly stimulate the nerves that lead from them to the brain. . . . When we have understood the olfactory organs well enough to crack the code in which they send signals to the brain when they detect scents, a computer with suitable connections to the relevant nerves could sent the brain the same signals. Then the brain could experience the scents without the corresponding chemical ever having existed. Similarly, the brain could experience the authentic sensation of weightlessness even under normal gravity. And, of course, no televisions or headphones would be needed, either. In a limited way-and without even needing to delve into classified research-we can see that we already practice manipulation of the senses. Take the problem of how to get the highest fidelity of sound-the most faithful reproduction of what our auditory senses would experience if we were there in the concert hall or recording studio. With the compact digital disc and the high quality of sound reproduction equipment, humans have already come quite close to the necessary delicate techniques for stimulating our auditory nerves into becoming believers. Screen Memory Knowing that comparison doesn't imply proof of any kind-just possibility-let's look at the idea that Budd calls screen memory. In case after case of reported UFO abductions, the aliens appear to directly control the sights and sounds that the abductees perceive. One woman with a history of paranormal experiences, Margaret, recalls that as a girl, she would sometimes feel herself unexpectedly paralyzed. At the same time she could see a raccoon sitting on the ledge of her window. The only logical problem with this memory is that the raccoon was sitting in a second-story apartment window in Queens, New York, with no trees around to climb up and it was on the inside casement of the window ledge. Budd's earlier hypnosis sessions with the same woman were connected to totally different incidents, where she did recall alien abduction experiences. It was only some time later that she casually mentioned to us that she recalled the practically impossible animal on her ledge. Budd has felt for many years that the UFO occupants in some way control what the abductee sees, usually substituting a more benign, common image (the raccoon) for something that might be more truly disturbing and anomalous (the alien). Neurologists tell us that our brains actually run on microelectric signals. We can hypothesize, then, that an advanced alien technology that is actively giving off electromagnetic energy on many levels of the spectrum may be using one or more of those spectrums in a very targeted way-to broadcast directly to the human brain. Depending on how widely or narrowly the target beam was focused, anywhere from one to unknown numbers of people could be affected. Perhaps only one abductee hears or receives a brain signal to sit alone in the park for a convenient rendezvous with a UFO. On some very different occasion, might ETs or UFO occupants broadcast a command to large numbers of inhabitants of a large city? In Witnessed, Budd reports that that is exactly what seems to have happened to a crowd of dazed New Yorkers. A Hybrid Implant for Your Brain Let's flip the scenario and suppose that, rather than remote manipulation of the human brain, aliens are able to discern the thoughts and feelings of their involuntary human participants in this study or experiment they have under way. If you find this idea to be entirely too sci-fi, consider some of our most severely handicapped citizens. The severely disabled have adapted quite easily to the idea that their brains are able to both artificially receive and transmit some form of communication."

        "text_source": "I suspect that this contact experience has been ongoing throughout the entirety of human history, and the reverence for the owl in folklore and mythology can be traced back to experiences like what Peter described. The shamans and sages throughout time might have confronted similar owls, staring at them from their own doorways. Perhaps the owl isn't chosen for its likeness to the gray alien, but because of its archetypal power. It's there so the experiencer can drink in some evocative essence. Does the owl imbue a deeper meaning beyond just a bird with big eyes? The symbolic power of the owl might have been implanted within our psyche at the dawn of human existence. The idea of the owl as archetype jumped out at me while listening to UFO experiencer Jacquelin Smith channeling the spirit of an owl. The concept of the archetype seemed like a message specifically meant for me. Dipping into the symbolic lore of the owl has provided some of the juiciest clues along my path. Jacquelin, speaking as an owl, said of the aliens:  They are using the owl symbolically, but the owl is still the owl frequency, to mirror to us in an archetypal sense, because humans think of owls in a certain way, right? There is an archetypal image that is mirrored to the humans, this goes on at a subconscious level and connects with the human's genetic memory bank. Because humans think with symbols, they are touching us on that level, and that goes back to the beginning of human kind, and how we see owls. Plato and Jung  Archetype is an elusive concept. There are ideas and themes that have resonated within the core of humanity throughout time, and they continually bubble up to the surface. In ancient Greece, Plato introduced the term archetype to define a philosophical idea, referring to pure forms which embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing. These pure forms are invisible to the eye, but they exist in the realm of their idealized states. If our souls have existed eternally, we would then retain a memory to recognize them. Plato contends that all the feelings that accompany our existence are but recollections of what our souls already know. Carl Jung later built upon Plato's ideas about the archetype. He saw the archetype as psychological, framing it as a collectively inherited unconscious idea or image. The archetype is universally present in both our individual and collective psyches. The collective unconscious is a unique component to Jung's ideas about the mind, it serves as a form of psychological inheritance. It contains all of the knowledge and experiences we share as a species. He proposed that archetypes exist within the collective unconscious. According to Jung, archetypes are unlearned, innate, universal, and hereditary. These function as a way to organize how we translate into visible reality the world within us and the world around us. The owl has been scratched into ancient cave walls and it also sits on the shoulder of young Harry Potter. It is an archetype that we hold within us and has the mythic power of the ages. Across all the world's traditions, owls are seen as messengers from another realm. Their ability to see into the darkness is a metaphor for their roles as this gatekeeper or interloper. The message they deliver might be to confirm the reality of these other realms. Owls are wise and foreboding, and these same attributes could also be said of the alien too. Are these elusive visitors using the image of the owl because we can tap into this grand lineage of arcane meaning?"

Either way, if the genes to be modified were carefully selected, it could take thousands of years before any significant outward physical change would be noticed. The cultural devastation and massive destruction of the movie Independence Day would never have to be played out, Hollywood-style-not if the human race was becoming, one gene at a time, more like the aliens. Or they more like us. Biologists open to the reality of the UFO phenomenon have indicated as early as 1988 that partial hybridization between humans and aliens would be the only reasonable scientific possibility-if there is any truth to abductions at all.14 Yet there is still an insistence that the sperm and egg routine reported by abductees isn't a very likely route for such blending of interspecies traits. Looking at the most recent studies on transgenic animals, however, I'd prefer to leave human sex cells in the running as likely candidates for alien harvesting. According to a citation in PubMed, the respected on-line site for juried scientific research, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reported: Transgenic mice are a unique tool for understanding how interactions between individual genes and the environment affect human health. . . . Most transgenic mice are made by injecting a transgene into fertilized eggs. The eggs are removed from the oviduct, and an ultrafine glass pipet is used to inject a solution containing a few hundred copies of the transgene DNA into the nucleus. The injected eggs are put into the oviduct of a surrogate mother, and the pups are born 19 days later. Some of these mice will have the transgene incorporated into their genome and their descendents for generations to follow will also carry the transgene. In other words, when attempting to modify a species, our own scientists insert the gene of the alien or other species into an egg that has already known (in the best biblical sense of the word) a sperm. The researchers in animal science at University of California at Davis also state: Transgenic animals carry a genetic modification, usually a single gene, that was introduced by injecting a small piece of foreign DNA into a developing embryo. If the foreign DNA is stably integrated into the host genome, the transgene can be expressed by the transgenic animal and passed in the gametes to future generations. These are difficult issues to take in, both emotionally and intellectually. The subtle but inexorable alteration of the human species? Who wants to deal with navigating the complex technological and scientific issues of that idea? Even if we think of bioengineering dilemmas as strictly human, earthly technologies, it's likely to take a series of highly emotional or outrageous incidents to bring society face-to-face with the implications of transgenics. When it does, don't be surprised if you hear loud rumblings and find skid marks on the pavement surrounding the subject. Because if hybridization is a calico alley cat, transgenics is a glossy, cybernetic cheetah. It's as invisible as it wants to be-a high-tech, easy-to-conceal kind of genetic manipulation. And it can change the genome of an entire species in a condensed amount of time-without being visible in the exterior traits of the animal. This last point is a significant one to keep in mind as we explore further what might be happening to abductees. If there is genetic manipulation or gene transfer going on, it would be a very subtle process of change. Biologists tell us that an entire species can do most of its changing internally, with new species traits only gradually manifesting themselves in outward appearance and behavior. Remember the imagined uproar caused by consumers who bought strawberries in December and later discovered that a salmon gene had been covertly inserted into their fruit, allowing it to survive a frost? The current biotech industry shows that we can already harness and reroute the basic elements of life by inserting specific genes from one species into another. A perfect example of this is the general conversion, worldwide, to genetically modified foods-often unlabeled as such-which have become the most widely adopted products in the history of cultured crops. According to Michael Specter, writing in The New Yorker, an estimated thirty thousand products are now made from genetically modified crops. Have you eaten corn or corn products lately? What about tomatoes, soybeans, squash, pasta, breads, ice cream, candy, or processed meats? If you have, you've almost certainly consumed genetically modified foods. The First Bioengineered Monkey Born Scientists in Portland, Oregon, announced in mid-January, 2001, the birth of the first monkey with genetically engineered cells. Molecular tests prove that the foreign gene from another species is definitely in the newborn's cells, the scientists say, making him a genuine transgenic monkey. But it's still too early to tell whether the gene's function will express itself in the monkey's physical appearance (phenotype) or be permanently passed along in his sperm. But if and when the foreigner's gene does turn on, it will literally light up the monkey. The gene that was inserted was a marker gene from a jellyfish-a visible way for the scientists to track the gene's progress. It causes the monkey cells to make a protein that glows under a fluorescent light. Among the group of researchers at Oregon Health Sciences University, this is seen as only a first step in the ultimate goal of creating colonies of monkeys that have been genetically modified to develop human diseases. Lucky them. And they didn't even have to sign an informed-consent form. Still, it's a step that other scientists consider controversial. Once you start attempting genetic engineering in monkeys, humans can't be far behind, says Professor Lori Andrews of the ChicagoKent College of Law. Actually, UFO researchers have been suggesting for some time that this is exactly what is going on with millions of adults living in the United States alone. And, just as in the monkey's case, the abductee does not go willingly and never has to consent. But a simple, stark fact that most scientists agree on is that when you move DNA from one species to another, there's no telling how the new combination of genes will interact or what possibly lethal effects might result.19 For those of us interested in the impact upon our species of ostensible ET genetic manipulation, the opponents of bioengineered foods make a major relevant point: that the action of any gene can depend upon the species in which it is placed. Abductees, instead of having nightmares about possible creations of superweed, might substitute the term supervirus-a highly possible by-product of DNA transfer between species that could be unleashed on the human race, either unknowingly or intentionally. In a somewhat different problem of biology, scientists know that although transplanted organs from primates to humans would provide the best chance of taking, the idea is rejected for fear of transmitting retroviruses into the human population. With virtually no informed public consent, science has taken the human species to the very outposts of a new frontier in understanding how life can be created, altered, manipulated, and changed. Whether all these things should be done or not is a different question-one that we all need to seriously consider. Just because science can make something happen doesn't always mean that it should, according to the distinguished philosopher of science Philip Kitchner. There is, he says, no definitive right to pursue knowledge for its own sake, with no regard for consequences. It may very well be that a culture several million years in advance of our own culture has already confronted the technology of bioengineering. The basic building blocks of life-proteins, amino acids, sugars, etc.-appear to be the same throughout the universe. The question is: How different are the issues and problems of altering the life-forms on Earth from those of other planets or in other dimensions? On Earth, as most biologists will tell you, the process is complex, intertwined with other systems, and not yet well enough understood to be predictable and safe for human use. With no federal or institutional support at all, abductees can only hope and pray that the extraterrestrials know what they are doing-that we are not just the experimental-lab wet-brains, those mushy and unstable biological organisms who might well be candidates for upgrading to posthumanist level, at the very least. Disturbing thoughts, I'll admit. Who wants to feel this helplessly ignorant and in the hands of an unknown force that most people are still embarrassed to acknowledge as an intermittent presence on Earth? Our little lives are difficult and complex enough without the oblique shadow of alien intruders or anthropologists hovering over our heads. The predicament we're in brings to mind one of Budd's many stories, an anecdote about one of his first New York art dealers, a tiny Jewish woman named Tirca. Taking some paintings up to her Madison Avenue gallery one day, Budd, a politically involved young artist, launched into a passionate monologue on a particular issue of the day. As he pressed on, enumerating the intricacies of the problem, Tirca put up a weary hand: Stop! Stop! Just tell me this, she said. Is it good for the Jews, or is it bad for the Jews?"
