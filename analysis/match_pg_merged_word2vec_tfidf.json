Many of the beings that are being encountered in the world are bred by collectives to be servants. Their genetic heritage has long been lost to them. They are bred to serve, as you breed animals to serve you. The human cooperation that we are promoting is a cooperation that preserves the self-determination of individuals and provides a position of strength from which humanity can interact, not only with the collectives but with others who will visit your shores in the future. A collective is based upon one belief, one set of principles and one authority. Its emphasis is complete allegiance to an idea or an ideal. Not only is this engendered in the education of your visitors, but in their genetic code as well. That is why they behave in the ways that they do. This is both their strength and their weakness. They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them. Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them collectives because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world. Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.",
        "text_source": "Insectalin Leaders   Insectalins appear to be the ones in command. They seem superior in intellect and in breadth of understanding. They do not have the well-ordered routine by which grays abide, and therefore they are less structured. They do not perform commonplace tasks, like physically taking humans into a UFO or guiding them through the corridors into rooms. They sometimes conduct preliminary examinations on abductees, although these procedures are generally left to the grays. They employ neural engagement, and abductees report that they perform the most penetrating and strongest neural engagement of all aliens. They appear to have more knowledge of the program than other aliens. Abductees report that some insectalins wear robes or cloaks with extremely high collars that rise above where ears would be on humans. Researchers do not understand the role of these robe-wearing insectalins, and abductees almost never describe them as involved with common abduction procedures. It is possible that they have a higher status than other insectalins, but more research is needed to understand their function. Insectalins are supremely logical and appear to lack a humanlike emotional life. Abductees' descriptions of their personalities and communication patterns indicate that they care little about human civilization. To them, humans are an inferior species who are almost childlike in their ability to think and whom they can manipulate, not only individually, but societally as well. Insectalins appear to have no sense of human morality or ethics, although they may have their own characteristic morality. For them, abducting people is a logical means to an end. Thus, their ability to think rationally is similar to that of humans, whose history is replete with grand-scale attempts to exploit other humans who are considered inferior. In the insectalins' minds, we are the inferior ones ripe for exploitation. Insectalins are often more apt to communicate with humans than are other aliens. When they have a discussion, it is primarily about their program. I have not yet had a case in which an abductee asked questions about insectalins' personal lives, their non-UFO society, or life on their home venue. Insectalins will sometimes talk about the future, but we cannot be sure that they are telling the full story; they are careful not to divulge too much. Why they talk to people at all is unclear, other than that they may find it diverting to discover a human with the unusual ability to ask questions during an abduction. Insectalins care little about the people whom they use to create hybrids. They express no guilt or regret about their disruption of human lives. They have little or no sense of humor, pity, or sorrow. They do, however, express a strong entitlement to do whatever they want to humans. They appear not to understand human emotions and therefore they cannot empathize. Whether they have sympathy is unknown, but they and other aliens will stop pain if an abductee is in distress during a physical procedure. However, this may only be to suppress an adrenaline rush that could cause an abductee to become uncontrolled. Hybridization   I contend that the hybridization of aliens with humans-and perhaps other aliens-is the key to understanding the abduction phenomenon. This is a controversial hypothesis within an already controversial subject, but I will present information in this book that will add substance to my contention. All hybrids are created to perform specific functions. They all work constantly. Most do not sleep as long as humans do, but humanoid hybrids, and perhaps even grays, go into short sleeplike states. They all have the same neurological abilities in varying degrees of strength. They all communicate telepathically. They all give complete allegiance to insectalins. As hybrids become more human, we can see a progression of human features that the grays do not seem to need. Grays   Grays have had the most exposure in popular culture. They have been used to epitomize the standard alien in the advertising and entertainment industries since the 1980s. It is difficult to categorize grays in terms of degree of hybridization. The best way to differentiate them is by height and function (see Table 2)."

Some have centers elsewhere and have major satellite establishments here. It is an interesting fact of life that wherever Collectives exist and compete with each other, other nations have established their own defenses against them so that the Collectives cannot intervene in these worlds' trade, commerce and internal affairs. Because we are talking about many nations within a region, many of which have their own military establishments, the Collectives then must abide by certain rules of conduct or face very grave consequences. Being without significant weaponry of their own, they must utilize negotiations, diplomacy and influence as their primary means of accomplishment. Therefore, those whom you are encountering in the universe at this time represent highly organized, very hierarchical organizations whose function is resource acquisition and development. Collectives, by and large, are made up of a series of races functioning at different levels of authority and command. Those who really control the Collectives that are functioning in your world have probably not been encountered by anyone in the world yet. You have only recognized the worker classes who are bred to serve in specific functions. Though they are biological entities, their biological codes, their training, their upbringing and their genetic focus have given them very little individuality and individual abilities of reasoning and discernment. They function very much like, well, a collective mind. They are rigidly controlled. They have little or no personal freedom. Their areas of function are very specific and are carried out with impressive efficiency. Yet Collectives are inherently weak because they are not built on what we call Knowledge. Therefore, they do not have the strength of insight. They are not creative in their approaches. They tend to mimic one another. They rely upon their structure, their codes of conduct and their ability to manipulate the thoughts and feelings of not only their members but of those races whom they seek to influence. While the Collectives are very powerful in certain respects, they do have inherent weaknesses. Throughout history, Collectives have had great difficulty in maintaining control and authority over their resident populations because they comprise many different racial groups. The worker classes are bred to serve, but even they have certain qualities that the ruling classes of the Collectives find difficult to manage. Revolts have occurred, and Collectives have suffered great losses as a result. They are most certainly imperfect, but more fundamentally, they are not governed by Knowledge, or the power of Spirit. This means that their defenses can be penetrated, their secrets can be uncovered, their activities can be revealed and their deceptions can be comprehended by those who are strong with Knowledge and who are free to see, to know and to act. Other nations in regions such as yours deal with the Collectives very, very carefully and do not allow them any kind of penetration into their world's internal affairs. Sometimes the Collectives are viewed as a necessary evil to provide essential resources that are needed by these worlds. The Collectives have great craft and great skill in the areas in which they are strong. And nations which have been able to interact with them successfully have had to maintain a significant distance and be extremely discreet.",

Information from their minds can be transferred easily into other aliens' and hybrids' minds, allowing them to exist in different planetary environments. This could be considered genetic and/or neurological self-survival. It also fits with the dying planet hypothesis, in which the aliens' home planet is in crisis and they must continue their lives in some way on another planet. Furthermore, Earth's most advanced societies sustain life and order. The aliens could use this as a ready-made opportunity to take over an already complete civilization. Geo-political strength: The insectalins' program may constitute a geo-political takeover that is based on the circumstances of other competing groups or civilizations and their particular interrelations. By acquiring planets or populations, one group of aliens could obtain influence over other alien groups. Thus it could be an empire-building or power-accruing operation. Earth may be a rare prize in a universe teeming with life, but where intelligent, technological life is less common."

For we have come to be near the Earth, and now we are far away from the Earth, and the Intervention has come to intervene in the world, which it is doing now ever so greatly with each passing year. Trade and commerce is going on in many regions inside the galaxy, and we may only assume in other galaxies as well.

Your travel outside this solar system may be possible within the next two centuries, but we say may be possible because you will have to face the great environmental change that is occurring in your world, which has the power to undermine human civilization.

Instead, we were sent by Higher Powers from the spiritual realm to give these Briefings to humanity. We have come from several nations for this purpose and are united in our cause. You will not know our names nor the names of our worlds, for they must remain hidden. Once you begin to understand the realities of life in the Greater Community in the universe, you will be able to understand why this discretion must be exercised. You who broadcast everything out into space around you will have to realize that to be free, you must be discreet. This is a great lesson for humanity to learn as it stands at the threshold of a universe full of intelligent life. We are here to give you counsel and perspective and to correct many of your assumptions or beliefs that could jeopardize your ability to understand your situation and the great challenge you now face from Intervention in your world from beyond by other races who are here to take advantage of your weakness, your divisions, and your superstitions for their own purposes-to establish their precedence in this world without the use of force. We have spoken of this at great length in our previous Briefings. But now we must tell you about some other things that are important to know about the meaning of freedom in this universe-what it will mean for your world, the great change that it will bring to your understanding, and the greater unity it will require amongst your nations. For you will not remain a free world if you continue your struggle with one another-your dissensions, your competition, your violence, your wars. Fighting amongst yourselves, you have no idea of the presence of those who are intervening, or the many eyes in your local universe who are watching you, and all the errors of humanity being broadcast out into space for the discreet observer to see-your tribes warring with one another in a beautiful world that is desired by others. And though there are not many other races or nations that are aware of your existence, the challenge is yet very great, very real and growing all the time. So we must speak of things now that have to do with your future, that have to do with the possibility of humanity becoming a free race in a universe where competition has been carried to greater levels than you understand. We give this with great respect for humanity because you have kept your religious traditions alive, and the power of Knowledge within the individual is still recognized and honored here, where it has been lost and forgotten or never realized in so many other places. For the great technological nations in your local region of space are largely devoid of religion, spirituality and the higher ethics that you may still hold dear, which we value as well. You stand at the great turning point of whether you will fall into submission to foreign powers or whether you will rise up from your endless conflicts to establish yourself as a free nation. We have given much wisdom and perspective on this in our previous Briefings. But now we must tell you what freedom means and what it will require of your nations and your peoples. While worlds are distinct and unique and different in many ways, the requirements of freedom in the universe are the same for all. You must understand these requirements and not neglect them in any way. For peace amongst your nations is not merely the cessation of war and conflict. It must be a preparation for a greater engagement and a greater set of challenges that your world is facing now and will face increasingly as you go forward.",

But there must be a unity of purpose, a common purpose to protect the resources of the world and to establish a boundary to space where all nations cooperate with one another, not only for their interests in their national security, but for the security of the entire world. This of course will require an unprecedented cooperation between your nations and governments. With a Greater Community education and awareness, this great accomplishment is possible. You must turn your eyes to the heavens. You have no defense against life intruding from beyond. You do not have the skills to tell friend from foe or to recognize a competitor. You are obsessed with the needs of your nation and your difficulties with other nations. You will also need this unity to face the declining resources of your world and the great and perilous consequences for the human family. This includes the environmental damage you have created in your world-the damage to your climate systems, to your water and to other life giving resources that have supplied and sustained humanity over its long and slow evolution. Human unity now will not be the consequence of ideology but of necessity, for you will fail if you are divided facing the great change in your world, and you will fail in the face of the Greater Community if you cannot establish this unity of will and purpose. All free nations in the universe must establish this unity of will and purpose, particularly regarding their use of their home worlds and their awareness and approach to the Greater Community. This need, therefore, is universal. Your evolution has always been towards greater unity and cooperation, but now it must enter a more mature phase. For no nation will prosper and remain free if other nations in your world fall under foreign persuasion-a persuasion that will encourage human conflict in order to weaken the earthly powers that you have and to weaken the strength of the human family, fracturing it and making it more susceptible to persuasion, to foreign manipulation and to the need for foreign technology. Your unity must be a unity of purpose based upon a greater awareness of your vulnerability to space and the fundamental need to establish a sustainable use of your world and its vital but limited resources. Never think that you can go into the Greater Community and take whatever you want from it. For the Greater Community in which you live, and which you will face, is owned by others who are far more powerful than you. Your warlike nature and tendencies, then, must become arrested if you are to gain this unity of purpose and the will and the strength to withstand foreign intervention and persuasion. Human unity here may only be forged under a great challenge, for there is too much division of purpose and intent within your world for nations to establish such an essential common ground. It will be necessity that will drive you to create this, if ever you will. It will be an undaunted and persistent need that will drive humanity to unite in its own defense-defense against internal collapse and defense against external intrusion. Within your nations and your cultures, there must be this unity of purpose, or the great resources and talent of humanity will not be brought to bear to face its great environmental challenges and to face the difficulties of emerging into a Greater Community of life. Humanity's future in the universe will be largely determined not just by foreign persuasion or intrusion, but by your ability to create a sustainable use of the world. Here humanity will have to enter a more mature phase of its development. You will not be able to focus on growth and expansion, for your resources will constrain your expansion, and your growth and the universe will not allow you to reach out and take what you need from other worlds beyond this solar system.",

They come seeking power, resources and dominion. This is the nature of life. If humanity were well versed in Greater Community affairs, you would resist any visitation to your world unless a mutual agreement had been established previously. You would know enough not to allow your world to be so vulnerable. At this time, there is more than one collective competing for advantage here. That places humanity in the middle of a very unusual and yet enlightening set of circumstances. That is why the messages of the visitors will often seem inconsistent. There has been conflict amongst them, yet they will negotiate with each other should mutual benefit be recognized. However, they are still in competition. To them, this is the frontier. To them, you are only valued as being useful. If you are no longer recognized as being useful, you will simply be discarded. Here there is a great challenge for the people of your world and particularly for those who are in positions of power and responsibility to recognize the difference between a spiritual presence and a visitation from the Greater Community. Yet how can you have the framework to make this distinction? Where can you learn such things? Who in your world is in the position to teach about the reality of the Greater Community? Only a teaching from beyond the world can prepare you for life beyond the world, and life beyond the world is now in your world, seeking to establish itself here, seeking to extend its influence, seeking to win the minds and hearts and souls of people everywhere. It is so simple. And yet so devastating. Therefore, our task in these messages is to bring a great warning, but the warning is not enough. There must be a recognition amongst your people. At least amongst enough people here, there must be an understanding of the reality that you are now facing. This is the greatest event in human history-the greatest threat to human freedom and the greatest opportunity for human unity and cooperation. We recognize these great advantages and possibilities, but with each passing day their promise fades-as more and more people are captured and their awareness is recultivated and reconstituted, as more and more people learn of the spiritual teachings that are being promoted by the visitors and as more and more people become more acquiescent and less able to discern. We have come at the request of the Unseen Ones to serve in this capacity as observers. Should we be successful, we will remain in the proximity of your world only long enough to continue to give you this information. Beyond that, we will return to our own homes. Should we fail and should the tide turn against humanity and should the great darkness come over the world, the darkness of domination, then we will have to depart, our mission unfulfilled. Either way, we cannot stay with you, though should you show promise we shall stay until you are safeguarded, until you can provide for yourselves. Included in this is the requirement that you be self-sufficient. Should you become reliant upon trade with other races, this creates a very great risk of manipulation from beyond, for humanity is not yet strong enough to resist the power in the mental environment that can be exerted here and is being exerted here now. The visitors will try to create the impression that they are the allies of humanity. They will say they are here to save humanity from itself, that only they can offer the great hope that humanity cannot provide for itself, that only they can establish true order and harmony in the world. But this order and this harmony will be theirs, not yours. And the freedom that they promise will not be yours to enjoy.",

        "text_source": "OPEN CONTACT? John L. Petersen served as a flight officer in the U.S. Navy and Navy Reserve and is a decorated veteran of both the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. His government and political experience includes stints at the National War College, the Institute for National Security Studies, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council staff at the White House. Currently he heads the Arlington Institute, a think tank based in Arlington, Virginia. We have met on a number of occasions over the years in Washington. In The Road to 2015: Profiles of the Future, one of three of his books he has given me, he invokes a possible scenario when open contact is made with extraterrestrials:  For  many  in  the  majority  segment  of  people  in  industrial  societies who  believe  that  UFOs  are  real,  this  event,  though  disquieting,  was seen as opening up the window to a whole new world and reality full of immense questions-but not all necessarily negative. There was wonder and questioning in the context of a desire to solidify relationships and learn more from these strange 'people.' At the same time, pockets of people (and some governments) reacted as though acutely threatened. The assumption was that these beings were coming to take over, or unduly influence, the world and that the appropriate response was to quickly build up corporate and individual defenses. . . .  All societies with access to television are transfixed by this event. Never- before-seen levels of global excitement and anxiety are experienced. The implications of this event cause an ultimate change in most every aspect of life on Earth. One of the hardest-hit groups are conservative religious organizations, for whom this event does not fit into their relatively narrow explanation of reality. This, perhaps the biggest event in history, causes religious leaders to scramble to explain (and in some cases, modify) theology to fit this new situation. Although some groups see the benefit of the new visitors in terms of new technology that can be made into weapons, many others see it as a hope for solving some of the very serious, intractable problems the world is confronted with at that time. Energy production is of particular interest. All of which may be true. But is open contact a viable scenario? We have learned that many types of aliens populate the cosmos-including Earth. A number of these races, such as those involved in the hybridization programs, definitely do not have our best interests at heart. And those who are on our side in such matters evince an understandable reluctance to engage with us en masse. We remain a relatively primitive bunch. As Daniel Fry, a pioneer rocket technician whose first encounter took place in 1949, was informed by his alien contact:  If we were to appear as members of a superior race, coming from above to lead the people of your world, we would seriously disrupt the ego balance of your civilization. Tens of millions of your people, in their desperate need to avoid being demoted to second place in the universe, would go to any conceivable length to disprove or deny our existence. If  we  took  steps  to  force  the  realization  of  our  reality  upon  their consciousness, then about thirty percent of these people would insist upon considering us as gods, and would attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their own welfare. Of the remaining seventy percent, most would consider that we were potential tyrants who were planning to enslave their world, and many would immediately begin to seek means to destroy us. If any great and lasting good is to come from our efforts, the actual leaders must be your own people, or it must come from men who are indistinguishable from them."

In these Briefings, we will attempt to answer some of your questions if they can be answered. Yet some questions must be answered by a Greater Power, the Greater Power of the Creator of all life, who has put Knowledge as a potential within each person and within intelligent life throughout the universe. But such potential has not been discovered yet by the human family to any great degree, and as you will discover, it remains beyond the reach and awareness of many in the Greater Community, especially those who wield great technological power, who have abandoned their early traditions of religion to serve the religion of power, commerce and technology. It is true in the universe that the wise must remain hidden to remain wise, and that freedom is built on three fundamental realities: one, that a world's peoples be united sufficiently to face the universe as one people; two, that such people must maintain and protect their self-sufficiency so as not to become bound and dependent upon foreign powers who do not share their values or their emphasis on freedom; and three, that such people must become extremely discreet regarding their activities and behavior, which will always fall under the scrutiny of those who wish to take advantage of these people or who fear the freedom that such people might possess. Do not confuse the Ancient Home of God with the Greater Community. For the Greater Community is a physical reality, and everyone in it must struggle to survive and must face the reality of competition and all of its hazards. Yet each race has the promise to evolve and to become free and to become wise. This opportunity still remains everywhere, within all beings and all nations in the universe. Here you must come not with hopeful expectations or with dread or fear, but with a greater sobriety and clarity of mind. Do not approach the Greater Community wanting things for yourself, hoping and believing that those whom you will encounter will provide these things for you. For this is unwise and will rob you of the discernment that you must have to see clearly and to be able to discern those opportunities that are beneficial from those that only appear to be beneficial. This is the wisdom one must utilize within one's own world, for this is a universal truth. Our task is to reveal the real nature of the Intervention that is occurring in the world today, to warn you and to prepare you for the realities of life in the universe, to give you a greater impetus for human unity and cooperation and to show you the great need for the cessation of conflict within your world. We do this because we value humanity as a race. But we also do this for our own self-preservation, for to have another free nation in this neighborhood of space is of great interest to us. We support it as an ideal for all races. Yet in our local region of space, it will help preserve our integrity, and it will help preserve our autonomy if such a race as yours can evolve into the Greater Community free of foreign domination and educated about the realities of life beyond your borders. We will speak in these Briefings about this greater arena of life. We will give you the information that is needed even if it does not answer your desires for specific names, dates and places, which would be meaningless to you and which would not serve a useful purpose, for you cannot verify these things for yourself. What you need is a greater perspective and a greater vision. What we will impart will not be strange and foreign to you. In many ways, it will be akin to what you yourself have seen within your world and what you are able to recognize through your awareness of nature and history. Life in the universe has taken many different forms. Even though many races use technologies beyond your current capabilities, all must still face the rigors of life. All must still make the difficult choices between freedom and submission. And all must still deal with the need for resources and stability. It is a truth that all must face. No one through technology has gained exemption from the great requirements of life. You who are just beginning your journey into the Greater Community must now undertake a greater education. This greater education will call upon your strengths, your awareness and whatever wisdom may reside within your heart and within the hearts of all who dwell within your world.

        "text_target": " Societies exist in the Greater Community at every conceivable level of social and spiritual development. This ranges from pre-agricultural societies all the way up to empires, Collectives, and other kinds of organizations established between worlds for mutual defense and trade. At every level of this evolution, there are countless expressions. Yet as we have said, there are vast regions of the galaxy that are unexplored and sparsely populated, where many societies live in secret. And there are many cultures that have never even been discovered. In our previous discourse, we gave the analogy of the galaxy being linked together with a series of routes, like a roadmap in your world. There are major avenues of travel, there are secondary avenues of travel, and there are areas where no roads exist at all. The impressions that we would like to give you regarding the Greater Community are most relevant to your position in space and are most descriptive of the environments that are in close proximity to your world. Yet your range of vision is still extremely limited, and you cannot see beyond the closest planets even in your Solar System. Your attempts at radio communication are futile because no one uses this kind of technology for interplanetary communication. Travel in the universe is greatly accelerated by your standards but is still very slow, given the enormity of the physical landscape. Large empires and Collectives can only extend themselves where they have established an infrastructure nearby. Managing distant outposts is very difficult logistically and has other hazards regarding the intervention of other races, as well as problems with regional jurisdictions and disputes. For this reason, in sparsely populated areas of the galaxy, the Collectives will not be found. Even large empires may rarely send resource explorers to these regions, for they are far too distant, and even if discoveries could be made, the logistical problems in sending supplies and gaining access to these resources are formidable. To complicate the matter further, in more populated areas in the galaxy, there are regional rules of conduct. So nations are not that free to move anywhere they want to go in their explorations. Of course, we cannot expect the human family to understand this. Your current perspective is that the universe is really there to be explored and to be taken for your own advantage. But, alas, you are not the first ones to arrive there. And there are many civilizations and empires that are far older than anything that humanity has established so far on Earth. Wars and great conflicts do occur in the universe, but they are relatively rare. Rebellions and internal disputes are more common, but wars between large nations and empires in the universe are far more rare than you might think. We cannot speak for other galaxies, for we have never ventured there. But from what we know of this galaxy and of our own travels, we know these things to be quite true. Humanity is still discovering many secrets about technology, and so this is where it places its hope and its promise. However, amongst more advanced nations, power of influence in the mental environment is the far greater arena of influence. For as we have said, technology can be purchased and copied. That is not where the real advantages will usually be found. However, resources are valuable, and therefore, the destruction of natural environments is generally looked on with disfavor. To preserve these resources and environments, most resource explorers including Collectives will attempt to persuade the native race to come into alliance with them rather than try to overtake that race by force. This strategy is also understood by many advanced civilizations, who have learned through much trial and error and through many difficult periods in the history of their worlds. As societies become more technologically advanced, the need for resources is greater and the preservation of natural resources becomes a greater emphasis. In many cases, home worlds have outstripped their own planets' resources, even to the point where these worlds have become barren and unproductive. This gives evidence as to why your world is viewed with such great interest amongst those few races, relatively speaking, who are aware of you. Biologically rich, rich in resources, strategically important and accessible to many of the Collectives who live in this part of the galaxy, it is a true prize.",
        "text_source": "I will hazard three simple guesses:  Survival: Some abductees have theorized that insectalins need to spread their genes via hybridization throughout the galaxy to gain a type of species immortality. Information from their minds can be transferred easily into other aliens' and hybrids' minds, allowing them to exist in different planetary environments. This could be considered genetic and/or neurological self-survival. It also fits with the dying planet hypothesis, in which the aliens' home planet is in crisis and they must continue their lives in some way on another planet. Furthermore, Earth's most advanced societies sustain life and order. The aliens could use this as a ready-made opportunity to take over an already complete civilization. Geo-political strength: The insectalins' program may constitute a geo-political takeover that is based on the circumstances of other competing groups or civilizations and their particular interrelations. By acquiring planets or populations, one group of aliens could obtain influence over other alien groups. Thus it could be an empire-building or power-accruing operation. Earth may be a rare prize in a universe teeming with life, but where intelligent, technological life is less common."

For you live in a very well inhabited part of the galaxy, where rules of engagement have been long established and where war has been suppressed. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage for you. As we have spoken of in our previous Briefings, you are protected from outright conquest, but the possibility and the reality of intervention and persuasion are tremendous. You will have to gain greater skill here and preparation: awareness, determination, skill, restraint. For you now, the universe is merely the background to your great problems on Earth. But the reality of this universe is the greater force driving your world and your evolution. It is driving you because of the great challenge it presents, and the great opportunity and requirement for unity and cooperation that it will foster if it can be seen and known and responded to. Never before has Intervention of this nature occurred in the world, for you were still too primitive and your technology still too undeveloped for you to be viable candidates for foreign control and persuasion. Though the world has been visited many times over the course of your long history, Intervention of this kind has never really been attempted. But now you have created international communication, planetary commerce, planetary trade. You have created a basic infrastructure that others can use and profit from. This, plus the awareness that humanity may grow too strong for Intervention, has generated the Intervention in your world today, accelerated since the last great world conflict, and now accelerating in many different areas of your life. It is a challenge, if seen correctly, that will enable you to rise above conflict and constant dissension within your world. For the resources of every nation must be united to protect this world out of sheer necessity. Your understanding of the universe must change and become realistic. Your recognition of your precarious situation must be recognized and become foundational for you.

A collective is based upon one belief, one set of principles and one authority. Its emphasis is complete allegiance to an idea or an ideal. Not only is this engendered in the education of your visitors, but in their genetic code as well. That is why they behave in the ways that they do. This is both their strength and their weakness. They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them. Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them collectives because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world. Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.",
        "text_source": "The worst-case future is a sudden physical destruction or removal of the human species as we know it, even though the aliens specifically say this will not happen. It would be accompanied by a repopulation of hybrids, hubrids, and perhaps insectalins. This could be The Change. The evidence for this grandiose and seemingly science fiction assertion is slight, but the idea must be considered, no matter how ridiculous it seems. If hubrid sperm can fertilize a human egg, interbreeding between hubrids and humans could take place over generations, until Earth's population consists only of hubrids. This is a distinct possibility, because abductees have reported that male and female hubrids do not mate with each other, presumably because that would not further the purposes of the program. And there appear to be more male than female hubrids, probably because males can impregnate many female humans. If this impregnation progression occurs, hubrids would eventually take over all jobs and positions in society. Society would, of course, be unimaginably different. As the insectalins told some abductees, they are devising a slow takeover of humanity, leaving a small pure stock of humans for hybrid breeding purposes. This will insure the aliens' survival in the event that they need to restock the world with aliens due to an unknown eventuality. The remaining humans could be workers, used much as abductees are used. And, while the program is ongoing, aliens could keep humans to run civil society under their watchful eye. This is a possibility, because hybrids and aliens seem to have no concern about human social and political institutions. For example, they seem to have little knowledge of what a country or a community is, or anything that humans take for granted as the normal world's political structure and institutions. Indeed, some hybrids do not know the name of the country in which they are living and working. This lack of concern could be because, eventually, they will use their own hierarchical structures to run society. Or they might allow us to keep ours and simply learn about society as they live here. Or there mught be a combination of the two. The aliens could, as many abductees have told me, activate a mental switch, causing chosen trained abductees suddenly to become field workers in the final phase of the program. In this stage, humans might be herded onto UFOs and transported elsewhere, or simply be enclosed in confined areas. Hubrids and aliens would then take over and own the planet. This could be The Change, when all aspects of the program are fulfilled."

We will have gotten to a point where we can prove to ourselves openly as a society that they are here, yes. But that is different from being able to grab hold of a live one for open study. Fighting the black budget world would probably offer the most hope on this matter, but it may well take an extended struggle to make that happen, perhaps many years. It is also quite possible that whatever bodies are being held make up only a small piece of the grand puzzle of what constitutes these Others. Very likely, the real action after Disclosure will be dealing with issues internal to our own society. It may well be that at least some of these beings have established a residence on our world. There is certainly reason to believe, gained from countless insider leaks and claims, that there is communication of some sort between them and the black budget community. There are also claims, and good reason to consider, that some of them have insinuated themselves into our society, perhaps even our power structure. Why would that be so illogical? On the contrary, it would seem to be entirely logical. They would know that humanity is on the fast track, and that when we get to the point where we might prove to be a genuine annoyance, all the more reason for them to have their own people on the inside. In the post-Disclosure world, this question will be raised more than once. There will be no easy way around it. Disclosure of the UFO reality will force our civilization to resolve many longstanding challenges and problems. Looking at only a few of these, it is easy to see why secrecy on this matter has been paramount for so long. Uncovering it will be the most revolutionary act in human history. The Long View   Looking further ahead into the future, we can discern some contours of that distant shore. It will be a world with an open recognition of the presence of other, alien intelligences here on Earth, interacting with this planet and humanity. That will be out in the open. Whether they will be out in the open is another matter altogether. But its open acknowledgement will be a great spur to our intellectual development. The dominant technologies a century from now will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to recognize today. Computing power and artificial intelligence will be orders of magnitude greater."

        "text_source": "Sociologist Ron Westrum expressed concerns about the implications of ET contact for our society: I think in some respects UFOs could present us with a situation analogous to captivity or conquest, or even more closely, to a child's relation to an unpredictable parent. The temptation in such circumstances to become passive and autistic is very strong. One need only consider how contact with superior technology introduced benignly can be disastrous, to appreciate what such technology introduced indifferently or malignantly might do. Societies which pride themselves on their technical superiority and advancement (as ours does) would seem particularly vulnerable .... One should not be fooled by the trivial effects on our society which UFOs now exert. UFOs are a Protean force. It is wise to consider not just the actual, but also potential, behavior. What UFOs do now should not be taken as a given; it could too easily change. \u2022 Another sociologist who specializes in social psychology, Robert L. Hall, has stated that fear of mass panic or individual human overreaction to extraterrestrial contact is basically a \"popular myth\" not grounded in objective research. But the myth persists in journalistic circles and influences public policy considerations. It is very common that public authorities act on the assumption that the public is likely to behave foolishly and even destructively in the face of a threat, especially an ill-understood threat. In the so-called invasion from Mars panic [Orson Welles's infamous fictional radio broadcast about Martians landing in New jersey), the commonly held, though distorted, view of how people reacted is based on the most extreme reactions [rather than the full range of reactions) .... From a close study of collective behavior, my informed guess as to how most people would react to extraterrestrial contact is that they would seek more information, and they would engage in lots of discussion of the significance of the contact. If plenty of credible information is available, there is very little risk of any harmful or destructive behavior of the kind we might call panic.\u2022 Dr. Michael D. Swords, professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, has studied closely the history of the government's handling of UFO reports. 10 For a special report on government UFO policy he contributed the following remarks about the potential impact of UFOs on society: \"The revelation of an alien presence might drive us even closer together into a World Community ... the Earth is slowly heading this way anyway. ... My guess is that, being in a rather different technostate than the Amazonian Shaman [whose 'dreams' were taken away by contact with Western culture], we would swiftly 'create new dreams.' Religion would adjust. Catholicism and others already have. Galileo and Darwin were far greater challenges than ET.\" He went on to say that there are three interrelated problems associated with ET contact: ( 1) the unknown economic impact; (2) the subtle psychological impact of an alien presence whose objectives are unknown; and (3) the stronger psychological impact of alien abductions that contain both apparently negative elements and unknown objectives. These three could possibly feed off one another to create very negative social consequences, all founded on the awareness that the Government cannot control the phenomenon .... I believe that the economic concerns are a red herring .... I could imagine that the human race could adjust to the thought of covert, neutral (undamaging), alien observation in much the same way fish in a bowl might do, or, as we ourselves did living with the bomb. So the critical point is not, perhaps, alien covert presence, but 'abduction.' The point is that we in the human race have plenty of experience living with danger, threat, and death. Even in the worst-case alien scenario ... would not we respond, adjust, and go about our lives? Maj. john R. King, USAF, wrote a thesis on the UFO problem as part of his coursework for the Air Command and Staff College, Air University, examining the political and social implications of ET contact using alternative scenarios of hostility and benevolence. 12 Some of the political implications he foresaw were potential loss of confidence in government and in existing political parties and changes in national policies and international power relationships. \"One wonders if considerations such as outlined above have not been causing feelings of uneasiness in certain government quarters,\" he said. Among the potential sociological consequences he envisioned were: \u2022 Initial shock and consternation \u2022 Loss or reduction of ego \u2022 Modification of human values \u2022 Decrease in status of scientists \u2022 Reevaluation of religions \"[There could be) an almost infinite number of implications in economics, industry, the arts ... across the whole spectrum of human activity. The point is that we should be thinking about all these implications so that we can be better prepared for the day when we might be confronted with an overt approach on the part of extraterrestrials .... The gravity of the implications for mankind in the existence of UFOs may be the root cause for the puzzling official pronouncements and approach to the problem.\" Impact on Religion At least two surveys have been done on the question of contact with extraterrestrial life and its impact on religion. A study by Dennis P. Rosenbaum and Richard A. Maier involved a telephone survey of a random sample of 73 priests and ministers. The results strongly supported two hypotheses: (l) many denominations have not yet taken a position on the ET life issue; and (2) Christian religious fundamentalism is inversely related to belief in ET life. The authors concluded: \"[The results clearly imply that) if evidence supporting the existence of extraterrestrial life increases, religious individuals and institutions that hold tightly to the written words of the Bible will experience more dissonance and will have greater difficulty resolving the conflict than those who prefer a less fundamental interpretation of Scripture.\" A recent, more comprehensive, study by Victoria Alexander surveyed 1 ,000 randomly selected religious bodies in the continental United States!\" As summarized, the findings based on 230 respondents provide evidence to dispute \"the concept that religion would falter or collapse if confronted by the reality of advanced extraterrestrial life .... \" On a response scale ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree,\" the response to the first two key questions was as follows: \"Official confirmation of the discovery of an advanced technologically superior extraterrestrial civilization would have severe negative effects on the country's moral, social and religious foundations.\""

        "text_source": "The Meaning of Training   Abductees' training indicates that they may provide services much more important than just teaching hybrids and hubrids. Some are being prepared to do alien work. Their training enables them to use their minds to find and control the movements, thoughts, and emotions of other humans. It is possible that, in the future, abductees may be abducting people with or without the aliens' aid. This disturbing facet of training suggests that abductees will supplement the insectalins in their program of integration and control. They may take a much more active role in the abduction phenomenon itself. Thus, abductees are far more integral to the program than had originally been thought. Training abductees to be more neutrally proficient is a critical consideration when we think about how hubrids can integrate into the society en masse. I had previously thought that mass integration would be accomplished with insectalins and grays directing the activities. Although this appears to be partially true, the insectalins have also created a society of surrogates to do the work for them on Earth. These hybrids can ensure that hubrids are smoothly and safely integrated. There may, however, not be enough hybrids skilled in human ways to accomplish the task of mass global social integration. The most efficient way to manage the program and to facilitate The Change may therefore be to expand the number of workers by training abductees to do what hybrids do. This will allow the aliens to have an expanded workforce when the time comes. Then some abductees will be more fully involved with the integration plans. Obviously, aliens make abductees do their bidding, and if the abductees had a choice, they would not participate on any level. With what we have learned from the foregoing accounts, we can now attempt to address the larger question of what all this means. We can speculate in a variety of different contexts about how and why the aliens, hybrids, hubrids, and abductees are working in concert to achieve specific goals. The nature of these goals, other than integration and takeover, still eludes us. But the program's future is becoming clear."

        "text_target": " In order to understand the visitors' activities in the world today, we must present more information regarding their influence on world religious institutions and values and on the fundamental spiritual impulses which are common to your nature and which, in many ways, are common to intelligent life in many parts of the Greater Community. We should begin by saying that the activities that the visitors are conducting in the world at this time have been carried on many times before in many different places with many different cultures in the Greater Community. Your visitors are not the originators of these activities but merely use them at their own discretion and have used them many times before. It is important for you to understand that skills in influence and manipulation have been developed to a very high degree of functionality in the Greater Community. As races become more adept and more capable technologically, they exert more subtle and more pervasive kinds of influence upon one another. Human beings have only evolved thus far to compete with each other, so you do not yet have this adaptive advantage. This in itself is one of the reasons why we are presenting this material to you. You are entering a whole new set of circumstances that require the cultivation of your inherent abilities as well as the learning of new skills. Though humanity represents a unique situation, emergence into the Greater Community has happened countless times before with other races. Therefore, what is being perpetrated upon you has been done before. It has been highly developed and is now being adapted to your life and to your situation with what we feel is relative ease. The Pacification Program that is being implemented by the visitors is making this possible, in part. The desire for peaceful relations and the desire to avoid war and conflict are admirable but can be, and indeed are being, used against you. Even your most noble impulses can be used for other purposes. You have seen this in your own history, in your own nature and in your own societies. Peace can only be established upon a firm foundation of wisdom, cooperation and true ability. Humanity has naturally been concerned with establishing peaceful relations amongst its own tribes and nations. Now, however, it has a greater set of problems and challenges. We view these as opportunities for your development, for it will only be the challenge of emerging into the Greater Community that will unite the world and give you the foundation for this unity to be genuine, strong and effective. Therefore, we come not to criticize your religious institutions or your most fundamental impulses and values, but to illustrate how they are being used against you by those alien races who are intervening in your world. And, if it is within our power, we wish to encourage the right employment of your gifts and your accomplishments for the preservation of your world, your freedom and your integrity as a race within a Greater Community context. The visitors are fundamentally practical in their approach. This is both a strength and a weakness. As we have observed them, both here and elsewhere, we see that it is difficult for them to deviate from their plans. They are not well adapted to change, nor can they deal with complexity very effectively. Therefore, they carry out their plan in an almost careless manner, for they feel that they are in the right and that they have the advantage. They do not believe that humanity will mount resistance against them-at least not resistance that will affect them greatly. And they feel that their secrets and their agenda are well preserved and are beyond human comprehension. In this light, our activity in presenting this material to you makes us their enemies, certainly in their sight. In our sight, however, we are merely attempting to counter their influence and to give you the understanding that you need and the perspective that you must rely upon to preserve your freedom as a race and to deal with the realities of the Greater Community. Due to the practical nature of their approach, they wish to accomplish their goals with the greatest efficiency possible. They wish to unite humanity but only in accordance with their own participation and activities in the world. To them, human unity is a practical concern. They do not value diversity in cultures; they certainly do not value it within their own cultures. Therefore, they will attempt to eradicate it or minimize it, if possible, wherever they are exerting their influence. In our previous discourse, we talked about the visitors' influence on new forms of spirituality-on new ideas and new expressions of human divinity and human nature that are in your world at this time. In our discussion now, we would like to focus on the traditional values and institutions that your visitors seek to influence and are influencing today. Attempting to promote uniformity and conformity, the visitors will rely on those institutions and those values that they feel are the most stable and practical for their use. They are not interested in your ideas, and they are not interested in your values, except insofar as these things might further their agenda. Do not deceive yourself in thinking that they are drawn to your spirituality because they lack such things themselves. This would be a foolish and perhaps fatal mistake. Do not think that they are enamored with your life and with those things that you find to be intriguing. For only in rare cases will you be able to influence them in this way. All natural curiosity has been bred out of them and very little remains. There is, in fact, very little of what you would call Spirit or what we would call Varne or The Way of Insight. They are controlled and controlling and follow patterns of thinking and behavior that are firmly established and strictly reinforced. They might seem to empathize with your ideas, but it is only to gain your allegiance. In traditional religious institutions in your world, they will seek to utilize those values and those fundamental beliefs that can serve in the future to bring you into allegiance to them. Let us give you some examples, born both of our own observations and of the insight that the Unseen Ones have given us over time. Many in your world follow the Christian faith. We think this is admirable though it is certainly not the only approach to the fundamental questions of spiritual identity and purpose in life. The visitors will utilize the fundamental idea of allegiance to a single leader in order to generate allegiance to their cause. Within the context of this religion, the identification with Jesus the Christ will be greatly utilized. The hope and the promise of his return to the world offers your visitors a perfect opportunity, particularly at this turning point in the millennium.",

        "text_source": "If abductees are still uncooperative and the hybrids cannot correct them, even with physical punishment, they are ultimately sent to insectalins or tall grays who, through stronger neural engagement, try to persuade them to cooperate. Although any hubrid can control any one human in a normal situation, it seems that neurally weaker hubrids have difficulty controlling several humans at once. Thus, hubrids are especially vulnerable when threatened by a group of humans. Conversely, they have found that they can mitigate their vulnerability by banding together. They can pool their neural resources to control obstreperous humans more completely. A hubrid told Betsey an illuminating anecdote about an incident that illustrates their pooling of powers as well as the threat of humans. Three young hubrids were in a public park late at night in a high-crime area when a group of humans approached and threatened them. Whether the humans were simply violent criminals or detected something strange about the hubrids is unknown. Working together, the three hubrids managed to control the humans, but only with some effort. The incident made them all the more wary of human tendencies toward violence. This has been reflected with other abductees. Eric told Bernard that humans' tendency to be violent must be controlled. Paula had the same conversation with her hybrids. Therefore, it is possible that the groupings of hubrids from two to four for integration allow them to have physical protection through strength in numbers. Furnishings   When hubrids move into an apartment, they must set up a household encompassing the basics of human home life. Betsey was involved with young hubrids who were moving into a sprawling three-story apartment complex on the outskirts of a small city. Her job was to make sure that the hubrids settled in properly. The apartments were unfurnished and the hubrids needed to know how to arrange their furniture properly."

        "text_target": "  It is vital for us to talk now about the nature of the inducement that is being placed upon humanity. Because this is an Intervention and not a visitation and because its overall aim and goal is domination of your world and the subjugation of the human race, the methods that will be employed will be used to encourage, to induce and to seduce humanity into a cooperative, subservient role to your visitors. Because your visitors are not allowed to invade this world outright, they must use these methods. Because there is more than one Collective functioning in the world seeking to attain this goal, they will all use these methods. In this, Collectives operate in much the same way. Because they do not venture into uncharted or distant territories, the Collectives must maintain their focus where they have a concentration of power and where their organization can function effectively. In this, they have become quite adept in using the powers of persuasion. Their primary focus beyond their normal avenues of trade and commerce is to gain access to emerging worlds such as yours and to new mineral and biological discoveries in the regions in which they are dominant. In most regions, Collectives are prevented from having a military presence beyond their own security forces. As a result, they must engage in more subtle and more time-consuming activities. And yet this is seen by them as appropriate here because they want humanity's cooperation. They cannot function in the world without your help. They cannot breathe your atmosphere. They cannot gain access to your resources. They cannot live upon the surface of your world effectively, and so in order to take full advantage of the resources of your world and the strategic position of your world, they must have human assistance. Indeed, beyond this, the Collectives that are functioning in the world today want to add a human component to their collective community and mentality. It is not simply that they want you to be a work force for them; they want you to become a part of them. This adds to their collective strength and will minimize any resistance in the future that humanity might mount for its own sake. This is why there is such a great investment of time and energy in gaining human allegiance, in bonding with humanity through interbreeding and in establishing a deep and pervasive association with the human family.",

        "text_source": "This \"politics of ontology\" (Mack 1992) is then the primary arena in which the reality and significance of the UFO abduction phenomenon must be confronted. Before its potential meaning for our individual and collective lives can be realized it has to be taken seriously and moved out of the sensationalizing tabloids into the mainstream of the society so that the sophisticated media is free to give up their supercilious tone. For our own government and other gove111ments around the world the abduction phenomenon presents a special problem. It is, after all, the business of government to protect its people, and for officials to acknowledge that, for strange beings from radar-defying craft to, in seeming defiance of the laws of gravity and space/time itself, invade our homes and abduct our people would create particular problems . This may explain why government policy in relation to UFOs has been, from the beginning, so confusing, a kind of garbled mixture of denial and cover-up that only fuels conspiracy theories. There are other political implications of the abduction phenomenon. Politics, local, national, and international, is, after all, a game of power. We seek power to dominate, control, or influence a sphere of action. But the abduction phenomenon, by its demonstration that control is impossible, even absurd, and its capacity to reveal our wider identity in the universe, invites us to discover the meaning of our \"power\" in a deeper, spiritual sense. Ethnonational conflict, which derives ultimately from the fact that we de1 fine ourselves exclusively in parochial regional terms (what Erik Erikson called .. pseudospeciation\"}, is the source of prodigious suffering and represents a vast threat to human survival. The more global, even cosmically, interconnected identity that is implicit in the UFO abduction phenomenon, might, at least, offer a distraction from our interminable struggles for ownership and dominance of the earth. At best it could draw us out of ourselves into potentially infinite cosmic adventures. But all this depends on taking the phenomenon and its implications seriously. The economic implications of the abduction phenomenon are inseparable from the political ones. The loss of a sense of the sacred, the devaluation of intelligence and consciousness in nature beyond ourselves, has permitted the stronger among us to exploit the earth's resources without regard to future generations. Growth without restraint has become an end in itself, as the reports of economic \"indicators\" endlessly intone, ignoring the inevitable collapse that cannot be far off if the multiplication of the human population continues unchecked and the pillaging of the earth does not stop. Furthermore, if the acquisitive impulse (euphemistically called \"market forces\") is not controlled, inequities in the distribution of food and other goods that do remain may deepen, giving rise to potential chaos and war without limits. The UFO abduction phenomenon does not speak directly to this issue. It does not, cannot, \"save\" us. B ut, as will be discussed shortly, it seems to be intricately connected with the nature of human greed, the roots of our destructiveness, and the future consequences of our collective behavior. For the abductees, the encounters can be ,, profoundly \"enlightening\" in the fullest sense."

Imagine what our world would be like if humanity learned how to master space and time. Could we travel, Star Trek-like, through the universe at warp speed? Could we somehow travel through time or into other dimensions or reality? There are many important questions nagging at our scientific community today. Are any of them better understood within the classified world in ways that have not yet reached the public realm? Keeping scientific secrets of this magnitude is not impossible and, as I will argue later in this book, has happened for a long time.

        "text_target": "~  How are collectives different from a united humanity? Collectives are made up of different races and of those who are bred to serve those races. Many of the beings that are being encountered in the world are bred by collectives to be servants. Their genetic heritage has long been lost to them. They are bred to serve, as you breed animals to serve you. The human cooperation that we are promoting is a cooperation that preserves the self-determination of individuals and provides a position of strength from which humanity can interact, not only with the collectives but with others who will visit your shores in the future. A collective is based upon one belief, one set of principles and one authority. Its emphasis is complete allegiance to an idea or an ideal. Not only is this engendered in the education of your visitors, but in their genetic code as well. That is why they behave in the ways that they do. This is both their strength and their weakness. They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them. Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them collectives because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world. Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.",
        "text_source": "I will hazard three simple guesses:  Survival: Some abductees have theorized that insectalins need to spread their genes via hybridization throughout the galaxy to gain a type of species immortality. Information from their minds can be transferred easily into other aliens' and hybrids' minds, allowing them to exist in different planetary environments. This could be considered genetic and/or neurological self-survival. It also fits with the dying planet hypothesis, in which the aliens' home planet is in crisis and they must continue their lives in some way on another planet. Furthermore, Earth's most advanced societies sustain life and order. The aliens could use this as a ready-made opportunity to take over an already complete civilization. Geo-political strength: The insectalins' program may constitute a geo-political takeover that is based on the circumstances of other competing groups or civilizations and their particular interrelations. By acquiring planets or populations, one group of aliens could obtain influence over other alien groups. Thus it could be an empire-building or power-accruing operation. Earth may be a rare prize in a universe teeming with life, but where intelligent, technological life is less common."

        "text_target": "There are many Collectives functioning in the region in which your world exists. Some of these Collectives are centered within this region. Some have centers elsewhere and have major satellite establishments here. It is an interesting fact of life that wherever Collectives exist and compete with each other, other nations have established their own defenses against them so that the Collectives cannot intervene in these worlds' trade, commerce and internal affairs. Because we are talking about many nations within a region, many of which have their own military establishments, the Collectives then must abide by certain rules of conduct or face very grave consequences. Being without significant weaponry of their own, they must utilize negotiations, diplomacy and influence as their primary means of accomplishment. Therefore, those whom you are encountering in the universe at this time represent highly organized, very hierarchical organizations whose function is resource acquisition and development. Collectives, by and large, are made up of a series of races functioning at different levels of authority and command. Those who really control the Collectives that are functioning in your world have probably not been encountered by anyone in the world yet. You have only recognized the worker classes who are bred to serve in specific functions. Though they are biological entities, their biological codes, their training, their upbringing and their genetic focus have given them very little individuality and individual abilities of reasoning and discernment. They function very much like, well, a collective mind. They are rigidly controlled. They have little or no personal freedom. Their areas of function are very specific and are carried out with impressive efficiency. Yet Collectives are inherently weak because they are not built on what we call Knowledge. Therefore, they do not have the strength of insight. They are not creative in their approaches. They tend to mimic one another. They rely upon their structure, their codes of conduct and their ability to manipulate the thoughts and feelings of not only their members but of those races whom they seek to influence. While the Collectives are very powerful in certain respects, they do have inherent weaknesses. Throughout history, Collectives have had great difficulty in maintaining control and authority over their resident populations because they comprise many different racial groups. The worker classes are bred to serve, but even they have certain qualities that the ruling classes of the Collectives find difficult to manage. Revolts have occurred, and Collectives have suffered great losses as a result. They are most certainly imperfect, but more fundamentally, they are not governed by Knowledge, or the power of Spirit. This means that their defenses can be penetrated, their secrets can be uncovered, their activities can be revealed and their deceptions can be comprehended by those who are strong with Knowledge and who are free to see, to know and to act. Other nations in regions such as yours deal with the Collectives very, very carefully and do not allow them any kind of penetration into their world's internal affairs. Sometimes the Collectives are viewed as a necessary evil to provide essential resources that are needed by these worlds. The Collectives have great craft and great skill in the areas in which they are strong. And nations which have been able to interact with them successfully have had to maintain a significant distance and be extremely discreet.",
        "text_source": "Insectalin Leaders   Insectalins appear to be the ones in command. They seem superior in intellect and in breadth of understanding. They do not have the well-ordered routine by which grays abide, and therefore they are less structured. They do not perform commonplace tasks, like physically taking humans into a UFO or guiding them through the corridors into rooms. They sometimes conduct preliminary examinations on abductees, although these procedures are generally left to the grays. They employ neural engagement, and abductees report that they perform the most penetrating and strongest neural engagement of all aliens. They appear to have more knowledge of the program than other aliens. Abductees report that some insectalins wear robes or cloaks with extremely high collars that rise above where ears would be on humans. Researchers do not understand the role of these robe-wearing insectalins, and abductees almost never describe them as involved with common abduction procedures. It is possible that they have a higher status than other insectalins, but more research is needed to understand their function. Insectalins are supremely logical and appear to lack a humanlike emotional life. Abductees' descriptions of their personalities and communication patterns indicate that they care little about human civilization. To them, humans are an inferior species who are almost childlike in their ability to think and whom they can manipulate, not only individually, but societally as well. Insectalins appear to have no sense of human morality or ethics, although they may have their own characteristic morality. For them, abducting people is a logical means to an end. Thus, their ability to think rationally is similar to that of humans, whose history is replete with grand-scale attempts to exploit other humans who are considered inferior. In the insectalins' minds, we are the inferior ones ripe for exploitation. Insectalins are often more apt to communicate with humans than are other aliens. When they have a discussion, it is primarily about their program. I have not yet had a case in which an abductee asked questions about insectalins' personal lives, their non-UFO society, or life on their home venue. Insectalins will sometimes talk about the future, but we cannot be sure that they are telling the full story; they are careful not to divulge too much. Why they talk to people at all is unclear, other than that they may find it diverting to discover a human with the unusual ability to ask questions during an abduction. Insectalins care little about the people whom they use to create hybrids. They express no guilt or regret about their disruption of human lives. They have little or no sense of humor, pity, or sorrow. They do, however, express a strong entitlement to do whatever they want to humans. They appear not to understand human emotions and therefore they cannot empathize. Whether they have sympathy is unknown, but they and other aliens will stop pain if an abductee is in distress during a physical procedure. However, this may only be to suppress an adrenaline rush that could cause an abductee to become uncontrolled. Hybridization   I contend that the hybridization of aliens with humans-and perhaps other aliens-is the key to understanding the abduction phenomenon. This is a controversial hypothesis within an already controversial subject, but I will present information in this book that will add substance to my contention. All hybrids are created to perform specific functions. They all work constantly. Most do not sleep as long as humans do, but humanoid hybrids, and perhaps even grays, go into short sleeplike states. They all have the same neurological abilities in varying degrees of strength. They all communicate telepathically. They all give complete allegiance to insectalins. As hybrids become more human, we can see a progression of human features that the grays do not seem to need. Grays   Grays have had the most exposure in popular culture. They have been used to epitomize the standard alien in the advertising and entertainment industries since the 1980s. It is difficult to categorize grays in terms of degree of hybridization. The best way to differentiate them is by height and function (see Table 2)."

        "text_target": "Our words will not be enough. Men and women must learn to see and to know. We can only encourage this. Our coming here to your world has occurred in accordance with the presentation of the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, for the preparation is here now and that is why we can be a source of encouragement. If the preparation were not here, we would know that our admonitions and our encouragement would not be adequate and would not be successful. The Creator and the Unseen Ones want to prepare humanity for the Greater Community. In fact, this is the most important need of humanity at this time. Therefore, we encourage you not to believe that the taking of human beings and their children and their families has any benefit for humanity at all. We must emphasize this. Your freedom is precious. Your individual freedom and your freedom as a race are precious. It has taken us so long to regain our freedom. We do not want to see you lose yours. The interbreeding program that is occurring in the world will continue. The only way that it can be stopped is by people gaining this greater awareness and sense of inner authority. Only this will bring these intrusions to an end. Only this will uncover the deception behind them. It is hard for us to imagine how awful this must be for your people, for those men and women, for those little ones, who are undergoing this treatment, this re-education, this pacification. To our values, this seems abhorrent, and yet we know that these things occur in the Greater Community and have occurred since before memory. Perhaps our words will generate more and more questions. This is healthy and this is natural, but we cannot answer all of your questions. You must find the means to gain the answers for yourselves. But you cannot do this without a preparation, and you cannot do this without an orientation. At this time, humanity as a whole, we understand, cannot differentiate between a Greater Community demonstration and a spiritual manifestation. This is truly a difficult situation because your visitors can project images, they can speak to people through the mental environment and their voices can be received and expressed through people. They can cast this kind of influence because humanity does not yet have this kind of skill or discernment. Humanity is not united. It is broken apart. It is in contention with itself. This makes you extremely vulnerable to outside interference and manipulation. It is understood by your visitors that your spiritual desires and inclinations make you particularly vulnerable and particularly good subjects for their use. How difficult it is to gain true objectivity regarding these things. Even where we have come from, it has been a great challenge. But for those who wish to remain free and to exercise self-determination in the Greater Community, they must develop these skills, and they must preserve their own resources in order to avoid being required to seek them from others. If your world loses its self-sufficiency, it will lose much of its freedom. If you must go beyond your world to seek the resources you need to live, then you will lose much of your power to others. Because the resources of your world are rapidly diminishing, this is a grave concern for those of us who watch from afar. It is also of concern to your visitors, for they want to prevent the destruction of your environment, not for you but for them. The interbreeding program has only one purpose, and that is to enable the visitors to establish a presence and a commanding influence within the world. Do not think that the visitors are lacking something that they need from you other than your resources. Do not think that they need your humanity. They only want your humanity to assure themselves of their position in the world. Do not be flattered. Do not indulge yourself in such thoughts. They are unwarranted. If you can learn to see the situation clearly as it really is, you will see and you will know these things for yourself. You will understand why we are here and why humanity needs allies in a Greater Community of intelligent life. And you will see the importance of learning greater Knowledge and Wisdom and of learning Greater Community Spirituality. Because you are emerging into an environment where these things become vital for success, for freedom, for happiness and for strength, you will need greater Knowledge and Wisdom in order to establish yourselves as an independent race in the Greater Community. However, your independence is being lost with each passing day. And you may not see the loss of your freedom, though perhaps you may feel it in some way. How could you see it? You cannot go outside your world and witness the events that surround it. You do not have access to the political and commercial involvements of the alien forces operating in the world today to understand their complexity, their ethics or their values.",

Unless there is a radical change starting now, from an individual's mind, within a family and family relations, within a nation and between nations, your people will all be destroyed by their own selfishness for power and domination.

There is a great and possible danger, too, that your humanity's intense desire to conquer, eventually seeking power and domination over the other planets, will mean only a complete massacre for Earthmen, because other planets will retaliate with terrifying power and force, only because of their fear of your selfish humanity coming to their planets and spreading greed and evil around.

They would think the end of the world was at hand. There are people who are aware of the Intervention but say, Well, we must be very careful not to come to any premature conclusions here. I mean, we have to gather more facts. We need more evidence. Really? For what? Can't you just see this and know this for what it is? Are you going to spend the rest of your life piecing it together in little tiny pieces? This is not a science experiment. This is the interaction between life forms! If you were diagnosed with a serious illness, would you want to become part of a laboratory experiment? Or would you want to get cured? You would likely want a path of healing established as soon as possible, and if you were sincere about relieving yourself of your illness, you would give it all of your attention. But certain people treat the Intervention as if it were a science experiment, and they are going to take a very long time and piece it all together, and they don't want to be wrong. Meanwhile, their world is being undermined right underneath their feet. They don't know it, and they don't see it, and they don't want to come to these conclusions because they seem unscientific, and they seem outrageous, and where is the proof? And what is proof? How much do you have to see before it is clear? Given the clandestine nature of the Intervention, well, not much is being shown to people. Not in broad daylight anyway. So, attempting to be scientific, you piece it together, and you are on the path of seeking the truth, and you don't get the truth, and you haven't gotten the truth, and you won't get the truth. And you are ambivalent about getting the truth because if you really see what it is, well, your science experiment is over. And now you must really act! You must really do something! And your colleagues will look at you like you are crazy, like you have lost your mind, like you have given up your reason and objectivity and taken a wild and outrageous position. So, as much as the truth is sought, at least in theory, it is denied, and no one wants to take the risk of knowing anything. This is a very hard thing to come to terms with, by the way. We understand this. This may be the hardest thing you have ever come to terms with, other than your own mortality. We don't expect people to simply accept this at first notice.

You decide for yourself so you might have a good friend you decide to live with, or you might get married and live with someone, or you might have kids and live with them or extended family. You decide for yourself. I'm telling him, Sometimes it changes. One person might move out, somebody might move in; a child might be born. It changes. He wants to know, When do the kids decide where they live? and I said, Not until they're bigger usually, because they need someone to take care of them. They can't just go out on their own when they're five years old. I said, We have certain ways of doing things and that's just how we do it. Some people don't leave until they're much older. He's having trouble with that one too; he's having trouble with a lot of these concepts. . . . He's saying to me, if he were to be here now, would he have to join a family because he couldn't be on his own? And I said: Yeah. They wouldn't let you be on your own.

This gives them stability and power, but it also renders them vulnerable to those who are skilled with Knowledge. Knowledge enables you to think in any number of ways, to act spontaneously, to perceive reality beyond the obvious and to experience the future and the past. Such abilities are beyond the reach of those who can only follow the regimens and the dictates of their cultures. You are far behind the visitors technologically, but you have the promise to develop skills in The Way of Knowledge, skills which you will need and must learn to rely upon increasingly. We would not be the Allies of Humanity if we did not teach you about life in the Greater Community. We have seen much. We have encountered many different things. Our worlds were overcome and we had to regain our freedom. We know, from error and from experience, the nature of the conflict and the challenge that you face today. That is why we are well suited for this mission in our service to you. However, you will not meet us, and we will not come to meet the leaders of your nations. That is not our purpose. Indeed, you need as little interference as possible, but you do need great assistance. There are new skills that you must develop and a new understanding that you must gain. Even a benevolent society, should they come to your world, would have such an influence and such an impact upon you that you would become dependent upon them and would not establish your own strength, your own power and your own self-sufficiency. You would be so reliant upon their technology and upon their understanding that they would not be able to leave you. And indeed, their arrival here would make you even more vulnerable to interference in the future. For you would desire their technology, and you would want to travel along the corridors of trade in the Greater Community. Yet you would not be prepared, and you would not be wise. That is why your future friends are not here. That is why they are not coming to help you. For you would not become strong if they did. You would want to associate with them, you would want to have alliances with them, but you would be so weak that you could not protect yourselves. In essence, you would become part of their culture, which they do not will. Perhaps many people will not be able to understand what we are saying here, but in time this will make perfect sense to you, and you will see its wisdom and its necessity. At this moment, you are far too frail, too distracted and too conflicted to form strong alliances, even with those who could be your future friends. Humanity cannot yet speak as one voice, and so you are prone to intervention and manipulation from beyond. As the reality of the Greater Community becomes more well known within your world, and if our message can reach enough people, then there will be a growing consensus that there is a greater problem facing humanity. This could create a new basis for cooperation and consensus. For what possible advantage can one nation in your world have over another when the entire world is threatened by the Intervention? And who could seek to gain individual power in an environment where alien forces are intervening? If freedom is to be real in your world, it must be shared. It must be recognized and known. It cannot be the privilege of the few or there will be no real strength here. We understand from the Unseen Ones that already there are people who seek world dominion because they believe they have the visitors' blessings and support. They have the visitors' assurance that they will be assisted in their quest for power. And yet, what are they giving away but the keys to their own freedom and the freedom of their world? They are unknowing and unwise. They cannot see their error. We also understand that there are those who believe that the visitors are here to represent a spiritual renaissance and a new hope for humanity, but how can they know, they who know nothing of the Greater Community? It is their hope and their desire that this be the case, and such wishes are accommodated by the visitors, for very obvious reasons. What we are saying here is there can be nothing short of real freedom in the world, real power and real unity. We make our message available to everyone, and we trust that our words can be received and considered seriously. Yet we have no control over your response. And the superstitions and the fears of the world may make our message beyond the reach for many. But the promise is still there. To give you more, we would have to take over your world, which we do not want to do. Therefore, we give all that we can give without interfering in your affairs. Yet there are many who want interference. They want to be rescued or saved by someone else. They do not trust the possibilities for humanity. They do not believe in humanity's inherent strengths and capabilities. They will give over their freedom willingly. They will believe what they are told by the visitors. And they will serve their new masters, thinking that what they are being given is their own liberation. Freedom is a precious thing in the Greater Community. Never forget this. Your freedom, our freedom. And what is freedom but the ability to follow Knowledge, the reality that the Creator has given you, and to express Knowledge and to contribute Knowledge in all of its manifestations? Your visitors do not have this freedom. It is unknown to them. They look at the chaos of your world, and they believe that the order that they will impose here will be redeeming for you and will save you from your own self-destruction. This is all they can give, for this is all that they have. And they will use you, but they do not consider this inappropriate, for they themselves are being used and know of no alternative to this. Their programming, their conditioning, is so thorough that to reach them at the level of their deeper spirituality holds only remote possibilities. You do not have the strength to do this. You would have to be so much stronger than you are today to have a redeeming influence on your visitors. And yet, their conformity is not so unusual in the Greater Community. It is very common in large collectives, where uniformity and compliance are essential to efficient functioning, particularly over vast areas of space. Therefore, do not look at the Greater Community with fear, but with objectivity. The conditions that we are describing already exist in your world. You can understand these things. Manipulation is known to you. Influence is known to you. You have just never encountered them on such a great scale, nor have you ever had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. As a result, you do not yet have the skills to do so. We speak of Knowledge because it is your greatest ability. Regardless of what technology you can develop over time, Knowledge is your greatest promise. You are far behind the visitors in your technological development, so you must rely upon Knowledge. It is the greatest force in the universe, and your visitors do not use it. It is your only hope. That is why the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality teaches The Way of Knowledge, provides the Steps to Knowledge and teaches Greater Community Wisdom and Insight. Without this preparation, you would not have the skill or the perspective to understand your dilemma or to respond to it effectively. It is too big. It is too new. And you are not adapted to these new circumstances. The visitors' influence is growing with each passing day. Every person who can hear this, feel this and know this must learn The Way of Knowledge, The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. This is a calling. It is a gift. It is a challenge. Under more pleasant circumstances, well, the need may not seem as great. But the need is tremendous, for there is no security, there is no place to hide, there is no retreat in the world that is secure from the alien presence that is here. That is why there are only two choices: you can acquiesce or you can stand for your freedom. This is the great decision placed before each person. This is the great turning point. You cannot be foolish in the Greater Community. It is too demanding an environment. It requires excellence, commitment. Your world is too valuable. The resources here are coveted by others. The strategic position of your world is held in high regard. Even if you were living in some remote world far from any trade route, far from all commercial engagements, eventually you would be discovered by someone. That eventuality has come for you now.

        "text_target": "From the perspective of your visitors, as we have learned, the United States is considered the world leader, and so the greatest amount of emphasis will be placed here. But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here. We are not the visitors. We are observers. We claim no rights to your world, and we have no agenda to establish ourselves here. For this reason, our names are hidden, for we do not pursue relations with you beyond our ability to provide our counsel in this way. We cannot control the outcome. We can only advise you as to the choices and decisions that your people must make in light of these greater events. Humanity has great promise and has cultivated a rich spiritual heritage, but it is without education regarding the Greater Community into which it is emerging. Humanity is divided and contentious within itself, thus making it vulnerable to manipulation and to intrusion from beyond your borders. Your peoples are preoccupied with the concerns of the day, but the reality of tomorrow is not recognized. What profit could you possibly gain by ignoring the greater movement of the world and by assuming that the Intervention that is occurring today is for your benefit? Surely there is not one amongst you who could say this if you but saw the reality of the situation. In a way, it is a matter of perspective. We can see and you cannot, for you have not the vantage point. You would have to be beyond your world, outside the sphere of your world's influence, to see what we are seeing. And yet, to see what we see, we must remain hidden because if we were discovered, we would surely perish. For your visitors consider their mission here to be of the utmost value, and they consider the Earth to be their greatest prospect among several others. They will not stop because of us. So it is your own freedom that you must value and that you must defend. We cannot do this for you. Every world, if it seeks to establish its own unity, freedom and self-determination in the Greater Community, must establish this freedom and defend it if necessary. Otherwise, domination will certainly occur and will be complete. Why do your visitors want your world? It is so very obvious. It is not you they are interested in particularly. It is the biological resources of your world. It is the strategic position of this solar system. You are useful to them only insofar as these things are valued and can be utilized. They will offer what you want and they will speak what you want to hear. They will offer inducements, and they will use your religions and your religious ideals to foster confidence and trust that they, more than you, understand the needs of your world and will be able to serve these needs to bring about a greater equanimity here. Because humanity seems incapable of establishing unity and order, many people will open their minds and their hearts to those whom they believe will have the greater possibility for doing so.",

(13) Should we admit how long we have been observing them? Would they reproach us for not having intervened to prevent a world war of this type, or would they blame us for it, or, more generally, would they hold it against us that we changed the course of civilizations? Very severe and lasting psychological disturbances should be envisioned in these cases. Would they be disappointed to learn that we are not immortal? Later, economic and technological exchanges and financial ties should be established with these populations. Would it be a wise policy to involve ourselves in local affairs? And in one manner or another, could we escape the requests to become arbitrators of political disagreements, peace, war, and economic crises? Whatever the case, one day or another we would have to pay the price for all of the unsolved problems. Would they not go so far as to reproach us for the contributions of our very advanced civilization, or at least for what we thought would be of benefit to them? Changes of opinion and attitude toward us could occur over time. Wouldn't groups of people be one day tempted to consider themselves our equals, because we were not able to remain inaccessible? Protest movements would consequently arise and revolutionary cycles would no doubt be set in motion, as a result of which we, as well as our Herodian allies, would suffer. Our global policy would then be compromised and we would have to consider making our contacts less frequent and, ultimately, withdrawing onto our ships and retreating. We would then have the time necessary to review our policies, based on the still unknown techniques of our catechumens. The discovery of new worlds could enable us to enter into contact with civilizations just as developed as our own and even far more advanced. Nothing allows us to rule out the possibility that, ultimately, we would encounter explorers from other more distant worlds. Under these hypothetical conditions, it is permissible to imagine that we might have been discovered in space first. It would be our turn then to experience - at least in part - the psychological effects and the political and religious implications that we have described. What would be the policy of local governments toward us? Would they welcome us peacefully or would they prudently keep us at a distance? Should we fear seeing ourselves aim nuclear space weapons or other weapons against, for example, the bases that we had attempted to establish or had succeeded in establishing in the asteroid belt close to one of their worlds? What would be the results of such encounters? What relations could we establish and what influences would we exert on these different types of civilizations?"

        "text_target": "But now the Collectives see an advantage, for humanity has built networks that they can use-worldwide communications, worldwide resource extraction and a sufficient level of technology that can, at a basic level, interface with what they use and rely upon. Humanity is also developing greater sources of destructive power, and should this power be fully cultivated, then interventions such as this kind would be more difficult to attempt. Lastly, there is the deterioration of your natural environment, which is threatening many of the very resources that the Intervention seeks. That is why the Intervention has gone into its mature phase in the last half century, an accelerated phase involving four fundamental activities: the attempt to persuade certain individuals in positions of power in government, commerce and religion; to establish a physical presence and familiarity within the world itself; to influence religious views and tendencies, which also includes the promotion of human conflict; and the program of hybridization to establish adapted beings in a human form who are allegiant to the Intervention and who can assume greater governing powers here in the world. These four interrelated programs represent the activities of the Collectives. Resource explorers operate in a more simple manner, by taking things they need from the world, as they are able to find them. But the Collectives have a more complex and long-range plan in establishing power and influence within this world. They recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the human family and your tendency towards conflict. They recognize that to gain human allegiance, which is their goal, they must present themselves as capable of assisting and even saving humanity from its own problems and from the great challenges that it now faces. The Intervention will present itself, therefore, in a more enlightened form-as spiritual agents, as those who have overcome war and conflict, who live in peace and who have achieved technology that humanity can now use and, indeed, now needs in order to rescue its environment and to bring a cessation of conflict in the world. Yet this all represents deception, for the Collectives actually seek to increase human conflict, to weaken the strongest worldly powers and to gain allegiance through human failure-allegiance and a reliance upon their presence. Their interbreeding program is not only to establish individuals in positions of power, but also to condition and to program those that they take to become the Intervention's representatives and apologists-those who will promote the Intervention and the peoples of the world having direct access to these intervening powers, bypassing their governments, bypassing human authority figures, in order to establish direct contact with those forces who are conditioning people to believe that the Intervention is here on their behalf. It is a clever approach and well conceived, and so far it is progressing with very little human resistance. Even the governments of the world have been seduced in many ways. They have made contracts with the Intervention which the Intervention has violated, and now there are those within the governments of the world who are aware of the Intervention and who support it, and there are those who are aware of it and who oppose it. So the seeds of conflict and opposition have even been sown within the corridors of power within your nations' governments, many of them. The Intervention is being carried out by physical beings who are driven by the same needs that drive humanity-the need for resources, the need for power, the need for wealth and the need for strategic advantage. It is these very things that drive all nations in the universe. You must not regard these beings as evil or demonic or as angelic. They are beings driven by the same needs that drive humanity. It is important now that we address the question of how the Intervention is functioning within the context of the three primary requirements that humanity must meet and must utilize in order to become a free race in the universe. The Intervention does not value freedom. It is unknown amongst its participants. It will, therefore, seek to oppose or undermine any progress that humanity will attempt to make regarding these three fundamental requirements. Human unity will be opposed because a united human family will be very difficult to influence. Human conflict can be so easily antagonized, increased and directed. The Intervention does not want to see humanity unite in facing the Greater Community. Therefore, human conflict will be encouraged, particularly by those hybridized individuals who have assumed positions in advising human leaders. It is their advising roles that have the most influence here. These are not individuals that you will see, for they are not public. They are hidden and well placed. However, they have their opponents within governments. For there is a struggle going on within the secret corridors of government, and that is why the Intervention has sought to influence commercial powers even more than government officials. For commercial powers are governed by greed. They seek wealth, power, predominance and advantage over their rivals. They do not have public scrutiny and are not accountable to people at large, and so they are much more likely candidates for the plan of the Intervention to gain human representatives and human liaisons. Human unity will be opposed by the Intervention, for a united humanity will oppose intervention. It will become increasingly resistant to any attempt by any foreign power to gain access or advantage here. That is why the emphasis for the Intervention is to amplify human crises, human conflicts, human disagreements and to encourage the proliferation of weapons, to lead humanity further in its own self-determined path of destruction. A weakened humanity will be vulnerable to persuasion, and a weakened humanity will be more likely to respond to offers of technology, to offers of assistance in governance and to offers of becoming connected to trade networks that already exist in the universe. If humanity declines, it will be hard for either your leaders or your peoples to turn down offers of technology and resources that will be provided for you-offers that will surely undermine your self-determination and make you dependent upon networks of trade, commerce and power over which you will have no influence or control.",

If we, or any other government on this planet, could duplicate their flight capability, we could defeat the military forces of any other country. That governments care about such capabilities is proven by the vast sums of money spent on advanced propulsion, detection, communication, electronic, and intelligence systems, for military applications. 4. We would be concerned that those controlling the saucers might join forces with any of the relatively primitive societies here on this planet. The United States, as the most successful, richest, most polluting, largest resource-utilizing country, would be a natural target for everybody. 5. If we, or anybody else, have recovered saucer wreckage, and done scientific measurements of the flight capability of these objects and their apparent ability to control the behavior of humans from a distance (as demonstrated by the many good abduction cases), we would try to make sure that no one else could find out what we have managed to learn. We would also be very serious about trying to determine, with the use of spies, satellite observations, and electronic eavesdropping, what others have learned on their own, and what they have learned about what we have managed to achieve in these areas. For instance, the National Security Agency is a large and competent worldwide eavesdropper, and sophisticated reconnaissance satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office monitor all kinds of foreign activities in secret. Past experience says the use of disinformation and misinformation would be standard practice, as in all military confrontations. It doesn't take much study of all the wars to see this. An important part of many sports is the ability to fake out one's opponents. Remember that the basic rule is that one cannot tell one's friends without telling ones enemies, because they also read the papers, watch TV, and so on. 6. The people in charge in all countries would be trying to predict what would happen if statements were publicly made that indeed aliens are visiting. It would be dependent on the framework in which the information was presented: Would all countries have to join together to make such an announcement? If they did, how would earthlings respond? 7. Over and over again people have suggested that the major reason information has not been revealed is fear of panic, as dramatized by the Orson Welles's radio broadcast in 1938 of H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds. Right? Personally, I don't think it is. First of all, War of the Worlds was presented as Martians destroying earthlings. What could we (before the space age, nuclear weapons, jet fighters, and so on) possibly do against Martians? If the story had been true, people would have had a legitimate reason to panic. But what if the existence of aliens were presented as peaceful visits by powerful, advanced societies who could obviously have long since destroyed us if they had a mind to do so? Suppose we were told that they were here for a variety of peaceful reasons from a variety of civilizations, all much more technologically and sociologically advanced than we are. For, if they hadn't learned to live in peace with other civilizations, they would have already been destroyed themselves-or, much more frightening, they would have subjugated or destroyed all the others. 8. If the persons making such an announcement were highly respected, or at least not considered threatening in the way that the presidents of the United States, USSR, and China might be considered (say, the Queen of England or the Pope), and added that international conferences were planned to consider the religious, economic, and political implications of the visitations, that might help. If there were suggestions that the aliens could help us heal the sick, feed the starving, and redistribute the wealth, this would be a threat to the powerful and a boon to the weak. You see, I presume that in all areas of technology (because we are so young on a cosmic timetable), our visitors are superior; not just in flying, but in eavesdropping, communications, medicine, and computation. I wonder what their reaction would be to the cover story on USA Today on November 6, 2007, noting that the average annual salary of major college football coaches exceeded $1,000,000. But 30,000 children died yesterday of preventable disease and starvation. No front-page headlines for them. 9. I presume that if such an announcement were made, no matter how carefully, church attendance would go up, mental hospital admissions would go up, and the stock market would go down (as uncertainty is always the enemy). I further expect, based on more than 600 college lectures, that many in the younger generation would immediately push for an earthling orientation, rather than the nationalistic ones that are the rule on this planet. To some, that would be great. After all, we are all earthlings. But, unfortunately, I can't think of any national government that would want its citizens to owe their primary allegiance to the planet instead of that individual government. Nationalism is the only game in town. People in power have a nasty habit of wanting to stay in power. 10. Some extremists in the Christian fundamentalist movement, such as Pat Robertson and the late Jerry Falwell, have loudly proclaimed that there is no intelligent life anywhere but on Earth, and that this UFO stuff is the work of the devil. Kind of an insult to God to think that this is the best she can do. They would be up the creek politically if an announcement of alien visitations were made. But not all religions have this attitude: Muslims, Hindus, and Mormons, among others, claim that there are other worlds out there. Father Balducci, who works at the Vatican, has appeared at some UFO conferences and made it clear that there is no fundamental reason to reject the notion of visiting aliens. Dr. Barry Downing, a religious leader with scientific training, has found UFO sightings in both the Old and New Testaments, as described in his intriguing book The Bible and Flying Saucers. He is a MUFON consultant."

The human cooperation that we are promoting is a cooperation that preserves the self-determination of individuals and provides a position of strength from which humanity can interact, not only with the collectives but with others who will visit your shores in the future.

They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them. Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them collectives because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world. Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.",
        "text_source": "Human-stage hybrids are indistinguishable from humans except in their neurological abilities. Little is known about the functions of these hybrids, but they seem to have a single-minded purpose: to ensure that the hubrids who are living on Earth are adjusting smoothly. They operate on Earth, but whether they stay here permanently is unknown. Some act as advance hybrids, coming to Earth to find housing for those who follow. Others act as security hybrids, who are rigidly concerned with protecting the hubrids beginning to live on Earth. They keep abductees quiet if they remember their abductions and make sure they are performing their duties of helping hubrids assimilate into Earth's population. If abductees are recalcitrant or resist orders, security hybrids do what is necessary to bring them into compliance. If abductees do not respond to orders and tell an abduction investigator about their participation in the program, security hybrids stop this behavior by admonishing them or, if necessary, threatening them and even using physical violence. Security hybrids live alone in apartments near integrating hybrids, although how much time they spend on Earth or on a UFO is unknown. Hubrids   Hubrids represent the end point of the human hybridization program. They are indistinguishable from humans in every way except neurologically; they can speak orally or use telepathy and, most important, they can neurologically control humans. It seems they have one main function-to live on Earth undetected, blending seamlessly into society. This goal is the penultimate event in the abduction program. Even after being educated about aspects of Earth living, hubrids are still exceptionally na\u00efve about the complexities of human life, and they require an immense amount of help from abductees. But they are quick learners and soon adjust to the social complexities in which they have been immersed. I have found two types of hubrids: independent hubrids who live alone and group hubrids who share an apartment, usually with one to three other hubrids. Independent hubrids are assigned to one or more abductees who may spend months or years teaching them about the intricacies of human society. They have personal and sexual attachments to abductees of the opposite sex. They are carefully monitored by security hybrids and by personal project hybrids who make sure that abductees will help hubrids blend into their human community. All hubrids are at first dependent on abductees to help them navigate the intricacies of society and need less help as they become more socialized. I have known about certain hubrids for over a decade, and my sense is that many are now living by themselves with minimal or no help from abductees. Onboard, it is often difficult for abductees to tell the difference between hubrid and other hybrids when they are in a group. Therefore, I am careful when using the word hubrid, understanding that they may actually be late-stage human hybrids. Alien/Hybrid Society   Aliens come from a collective society in which individuality and personal lives are virtually nonexistent. Function and task are paramount. They appear to have no idle or personal time during which they can indulge in any type of rest or recreation. Insectalins and grays have limited and narrow emotional ranges. Moreover, the world of aesthetics that occupies the lives of so many humans is nonexistent in alien society. It is entirely possible that no art forms exist-no painting, drawing, literature, music, drama, or dance. Likewise, there is no evidence of entertainment of any sort, except for hybrid children's toys."

Paul wondered how we had come to mistake the \"shell\" of our being for the \"whole\" of it; and Eva, in her recall of the Soul Bird story of her childhood, recognized there were compartments of self which she was opening up and merging in order to move from fragmentation toward wholeness. The change that abductees experience is fundamentally that they may no longer feel themselves to be separate from other beings. They shed their identification with a narrow social role and gain a sense of oneness with all creation, a kind of universal connectedness. This opening to a wider identity appears to be a direct result of the abduction experiences, if not a central aspect of the whole process. The change appears to be the result of two related elements. The abduction experiences themselves shatter the illusion of our control, and demonstrate forcefully \ufffdhat we are helpless in the face of forces and beings whose purpose we do not understand. Each abductee discovers that he or she is but one intelligent being in a universe populated with various other entities that are not \"supposed to\" exist. Human beings are not lords of the earth, they realize, but children of the cosmos who must find their way to live in harmony with all manner of creatures on the earth and elsewhere. This is a terrifying lesson in humility that opens the psyche to a wider perception of the universe, including the beings and entities that inhabit it. At the same time, as I noted, some abductees become open to the presence of a divine source, which fills their being and gives a sense of connection with a universal consciousness from which they have come and to which they will return. \"Past life\" experiences, which seem to extend the sense of self over time in both embodied and unembodied form, create a further expansion of the feeling of what it is to be a human being. Finally, the peculiar sense that many abductees gain during the relaxation sessions that they have a dual huf!lan/alien identity reinforces all of the above processes . For the alien self is felt to be a kind of missing part, a soul link to the universal source of consciousness, the anima mundi from which they feel they have been cut off.PoLITICAL, EcoNOMIC, AND RELIGious IMPLICATIONS The Western scientific/materialist worldview has been hugely successful in its explorations of the physical world, revealing many of its secrets and using this knowledge to serve human purposes. We have overcome the harshness of winter, reduced suffering through advances in medicine, and learned to communicate electronically with those who are far away. At the same time we have applied our knowledge to creating weapons of destruction that can now easily destroy life as we know it. Our use of modern technology to tear resources from the earth is bringing the biosphere to the brink of collapse. We are a species out of harmony with nature, gone berserk in the indulgence of its desires at the expense of other living beings and the earth that has given us life."

        "text_source": "In this worldview the various spirit entities, God or gods and other mythic beings that peoples throughout the world, including in our own culture, experience as altogether real have no objective reality. They are the subject matter of psychology and psychopathology, anthropology, religious study, and science fiction, the projection outward of the perceptions and images of the brain. If we make these entities real, it is through metaphor and symbol, as poets do so well. To acknowledge that the universe (or universes) contains other beings that have been able to enter our world and affect us as powerfully as the alien entities seem able to do would require an expansion of our notions of reality that would all too radically undermine the Western scientific and philosophical ideology which Tulane philosopher Michael Zimmerman calls \"naturalistic humanism\" (Zimmerman 1993). The alien beings that appear to come to us from the sky in strange spacecraft present a particularly confusing challenge to such a naturalistic or objectivist ideology. For they seem to partake of properties belonging to both the spirit and the material worlds, bridging, as if effortlessly, the division between these realms which has become increasingly sacred and unbreachable since science and religion went their separate ways in the seventeenth century (Toulmin 1990). On the one hand these beings seem able to be seen by the abductees, who feel their bodies moved and find small lesions inflicted upon them. On the other hand the beings seem to come, like intermediaries from God or the Devil, from a nonembodied source, and they are able to open the consciousness of abductees to realms of being that do not exist in the physical world as we know it. Before concluding I will speculate about why the barrier between the spirit and material worlds has become so entrenched in the West. For it is this pos1 sibly false dichotomy that makes our confrontation with beings who do not respect this gulf so shocking. SPIRITUAL IMPLICATIONS I am often asked how experiences that are so traumatic, and even appear cruel at times, can also be spiritually transformative. To me there is no inconsistency here, unless one reserves spirituality for realms of the sublime that are free of pain and struggle. Sometimes our most useful spiritual learning and growth comes at the hands of rough teachers who have little respect for our conceits, psychological defenses, or established points of view. Zen Buddhist teaching is notorious for its shock treatment methods. One might even go further and argue that genuine spiritual growth is inevitably disturbing, as the boundaries of consciousness are breached and we are opened to new domains of existence. This does not, of course, \"forgive\" the cruelties associated with the abduction phenomenon. The alien beings that abductees speak about seem to many of them to come from another domain that is felt to be closer to the source of being or primary creation. They have been described, however homely their appearance, as intermediaries or emissaries from God, even as angels, by Carlos for one. The acknowledgment of their existence, after the initial ontological shock, is sometimes (see Peter 's and Catherine's cases, for exrunple) the first step in the opening of consciousness to a universe that is no longer simply material. Abductees come to appreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itself intelligent. They develop a sense of awe before a mysterious cosmos that becomes sacred and ensouled. The sense of separation from all the rest of creation breaks down and the experience of oneness becomes an essential aspect of the evolution of the abductee's consciousness, as Joe spoke of in relation to his own and his baby son's development. Joe felt the choice he was facing was, as he put it, between oneness and insanity. The aliens themselves may come to be seen as a split-off part of the abductee's soul or Self; his or herown reensoulment requires the integration of this separated dimension. Many abductees with whom I have worked, including several not written about in this book, experience a kind of ecstasy which, as in Carlos's case, can reach orgasmic proportions as they feel themselves open through their experiences (or the reliving of them) to a divine source or creative center of being in the cosmos. This source is, to the abductees, inexpressibly luminous and filled with color, and they may weep when they find themselves in its presence, for separation from it was painful beyond words. When they do open to the source once again, they may call the experience a \"return\" and protest once again having to fulfill even a newly agreed upon purpose as a human being. As their experiences are brought into full consciousness, some abductees come to feel increasingly a sense of oneness with all beings and all of creation. This is often expressed through a special love of nature and a deep connection with animals and animal spirits. Sometimes there is a strong identification with one type of animal. Deer are, for example, \"totem\" creatures for Dave; Carlos feels a special kinship with lions; and Arthur has a remarkable capacity to connect with a variety of animals. The aliens themselves, as we have seen, may appear at various times to the abductees in animal form. The connection that they have with animal spirits, a kind of shamanic dimension, remains to be explored."

Many of the beings that are being encountered in the world are bred by collectives to be servants. Their genetic heritage has long been lost to them. They are bred to serve, as you breed animals to serve you. The human cooperation that we are promoting is a cooperation that preserves the self-determination of individuals and provides a position of strength from which humanity can interact, not only with the collectives but with others who will visit your shores in the future. A collective is based upon one belief, one set of principles and one authority. Its emphasis is complete allegiance to an idea or an ideal. Not only is this engendered in the education of your visitors, but in their genetic code as well. That is why they behave in the ways that they do. This is both their strength and their weakness. They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them. Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them collectives because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world. Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.",
        "text_source": "When hubrids move into a house or apartment on Earth, abductees are responsible for continuing to teach them about living in human society. Hubrid knowledge of day-to-day human life is insufficient and uneven. This is partly due to their unstandardized training. For example, some hubrids have never seen a fully made bed, while others have seen beds in peoples' homes. Similarly, some hubrids have never written letters or symbols, while others have done so many times. Specially selected abductees are trained for the responsibility of filling hubrids' gaps of knowledge and smoothing the edges of hubrid behavior, with the single goal of undetected assimilation. Integrated hubrids are usually between the ages of seventeen and twenty-five. Their knowledge about the complexity of human society is still rudimentary. Living arrangements can be puzzling; relationships with friends and neighbors are foreign. Almost everything associated with intellectual or popular culture is unfamiliar to newly arrived hubrids. They do not understand the subtleties of spoken language. They have little, if any, aesthetic sense. Consensual romantic relationships baffle them. Although these hubrids have undergone training both onboard and in abductees' homes, they still have very much to learn. Adolescent and young-adult hubrids have pleasant personalities. They are generally respectful and dutiful. Because they come from a highly structured telepathic society, they always obey orders. They rarely display anger or hostility. With some exceptions, they are not argumentative or defiant in the face of criticism. They lack the suspicion or wariness most humans their age possess. Often, abductees cannot help feeling fond of the hubrids; they do not sense that their presence represents a threat and perhaps even eventual catastrophe. But the fact that naive hubrids are moving into the society surreptitiously and most likely in huge numbers signifies a covert invasion. Unlike normal immigrants, they are not here because they want to be; they are here only to fulfill the aliens' goals. As polite, innocent, guileless, and unsuspecting as hubrids can be, their neural abilities differentiate them sharply from us. Hubrids use neural engagement to control human actions when it suits them. They use telepathy to communicate between one another or learn a human's private thoughts. Their overwhelming humanness seems to weaken their alien abilities, but even weakened abilities are more than enough to be effective. Conversely, abductees cannot read hubrids' inner thoughts and, consequently, we do not know whether they have the full range of human emotions. How much they will be able to blend into society is an open question. But humans can be very strange. So hubrids have a lot of leeway before anyone might recognize something is wrong. All hubrids are dedicated to their function. Their loyalty is to the program and not to their human trainers. Hubrids and hybrids may develop relationships with abductees, but they focus only on fulfilling the goals of the integration program. Abductees are a means to an end. As hubrids move into their own homes, the program of assimilation enters a new phase. The Assimilation Bureaucracy   Hubrid societal integration is not a complex process. The insectalins oversee the entire program. They have installed an effective bureaucracy consisting of personal project hybrids (PPHs), advance hybrids, security hybrids, and group hubrids to ensure that all goes well in the integration process. Hybrids within the bureaucracy often have overlapping functions, including, but not limited to, the following:  Protecting hubrids  Installing hubrids in appropriate living quarters  Making sure abductees instruct hubrids how to live within the norms of human society  Keeping the program's goals intact  Ensuring that abductees are in compliance with alien rules  Reporting recalcitrant abductees to insectalins or tall grays   Personal project hybrids now have a critical role in the abductees' lives. Before, they were primarily sexual partners or interested bystanders in the abductees lives. Now, with the advent of hubrids being trained in the field and then moving in, the personal project hybrids have the duties of keeping the abductees in line and, if they remember anything, not betraying the program to family, friends, or researchers. They make sure abductees are doing what they are told and instructing the hubrids properly. Security hybrids also make sure that the hubrids are safe and that the abductees are obeying orders and not endangering the integration program by talking to others about what they are doing. They are relentless and unyielding in their pursuit of obedience. Personal project hybrids often accompany abductees around and, in some cases, learn about the world themselves. For example, Betsey's PPH, whom she called Ken, met her at a supermarket and asked questions about the foods she put in her shopping cart. He smelled the fruit and asked about whether she cooked eggs, meat, and a loaf of bread. On other occasions, he accompanied her on trips to the ophthalmologist and to her family doctor, sometimes sitting in the room where she was examined. The doctors could see him, but did not seem to care or pay any attention to him. When the decision is made to begin integrating into a specific geographic area, advance hybrids are the first to arrive. Though we know very little about their activities at this stage, it is logical to suspect that abductees help the advance hybrids become acclimated. Eventually, the advance hybrids, with abductee help, find a location within their assigned geographic area suitable for the hubrids to live in and then obtain living quarters for them. Housing, usually apartments, must be safe and, ideally, near stores that are open twenty-four hours a day so they can satisfy daily needs-Walmart, Target, Walgreen, Kmart, or various supermarkets and convenience stores where they can enter late at night with a minimum amount of human contact. Once the advance hybrids have secured the accommodations, an independent hubrid moves into the living quarters. Soon, the personal project hybrid introduces his abductee to the independent hubrid, who becomes the abductee's student and, like the PPH, a sexual partner. After the independent and the abductee have had a chance to establish a complex personal and teaching relationship, the independent, the PPH, and a security hubrid take the abductee to see younger group hubrids who are also moving in. The more hubrids an abductee encounters, the more important safety becomes. Because hubrids are so critically important for the program's outcome, their safety becomes the program's safety. To protect them, the aliens have established a security force. Like PPHs, security hybrids bring hubrids to abductees' homes for training. But unlike PPHs, security hybrids have no interest in human society. Their mindset is fixated on the program's security and safety; that is all they think about. Abductees are not to talk about the program to anyone. They must do exactly what security hybrids dictate. If the abductees continue to talk in the face of pressure, violence can be used to stop it. Violence   Security also means protecting hubrids from violent humans. When an abductee reported to me that hubrids onboard mentioned concerns about violence, I was at first somewhat puzzled, given how all types of aliens can control humans. The more I learned, however, the more this concern seemed logical. I was already aware that abductees onboard sometimes regain mental control, get loose, run down hallways, and physically attack aliens. Moreover, considering the vast number of abductees operating within the system, one can imagine all sorts of scenarios where violence may become an issue, whether through loss of control of an onboard abductee, conflicts arising during field training experiences, or resistance from nonabductees when hubrids use their mental abilities to try to control them."

But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here. We are not the visitors. We are observers. We claim no rights to your world, and we have no agenda to establish ourselves here. For this reason, our names are hidden, for we do not pursue relations with you beyond our ability to provide our counsel in this way. We cannot control the outcome. We can only advise you as to the choices and decisions that your people must make in light of these greater events. Humanity has great promise and has cultivated a rich spiritual heritage, but it is without education regarding the Greater Community into which it is emerging. Humanity is divided and contentious within itself, thus making it vulnerable to manipulation and to intrusion from beyond your borders. Your peoples are preoccupied with the concerns of the day, but the reality of tomorrow is not recognized. What profit could you possibly gain by ignoring the greater movement of the world and by assuming that the Intervention that is occurring today is for your benefit? Surely there is not one amongst you who could say this if you but saw the reality of the situation. In a way, it is a matter of perspective. We can see and you cannot, for you have not the vantage point. You would have to be beyond your world, outside the sphere of your world's influence, to see what we are seeing. And yet, to see what we see, we must remain hidden because if we were discovered, we would surely perish. For your visitors consider their mission here to be of the utmost value, and they consider the Earth to be their greatest prospect among several others. They will not stop because of us. So it is your own freedom that you must value and that you must defend. We cannot do this for you. Every world, if it seeks to establish its own unity, freedom and self-determination in the Greater Community, must establish this freedom and defend it if necessary. Otherwise, domination will certainly occur and will be complete. Why do your visitors want your world? It is so very obvious. It is not you they are interested in particularly. It is the biological resources of your world. It is the strategic position of this solar system. You are useful to them only insofar as these things are valued and can be utilized. They will offer what you want and they will speak what you want to hear. They will offer inducements, and they will use your religions and your religious ideals to foster confidence and trust that they, more than you, understand the needs of your world and will be able to serve these needs to bring about a greater equanimity here. Because humanity seems incapable of establishing unity and order, many people will open their minds and their hearts to those whom they believe will have the greater possibility for doing so.",

Unless there is a radical change starting now, from an individual's mind, within a family and family relations, within a nation and between nations, your people will all be destroyed by their own selfishness for power and domination. Not until your humanity is completely wiped out will there ever be peace on Earth. The danger of atomic war between nations is imminent... It may not be now, it may be centuries from now, but the end will still come. There is no turning back for your people. Some day you will all be wiped out by your own greediness, and if a few good people live through, then they will propagate and breed an unselfish humanity and no longer will there be a continuous strife between nations, within a nation, within a family and family relations, and within an individual mind, and there will be peace on Earth at last. There is a great and possible danger, too, that your humanity's intense desire to conquer, eventually seeking power and domination over the other planets, will mean only a complete massacre for Earthmen, because other planets will retaliate with terrifying power and force, only because of their fear of your selfish humanity coming to their planets and spreading greed and evil around. This is our message. Transmit it and let humanity beware!"

        "text_target": "Even human science is beginning now to acknowledge the preponderance of life in the universe as a theoretical probability. Yet who is concerned with what your first great encounters might mean? As The Allies Briefings are presented, there will be all kinds of denial, criticism and repudiation. Why? Why so much rejection over an encounter that everyone really considers to be very possible? Yet when it is actually accounted for, you will see a great deal of denial. Outrageous! Ridiculous! Cannot happen! You will hear scientists say, Well, it is not possible for another race to get here given the limitations of travel and speed and so forth. How presumptuous! Do human beings dare to presume what other nations and cultures have been able to develop over a long period of time? Is the universe limited by human understanding? Is it not possible that other races could have far surpassed human accomplishment in technology? You may say, Well, of course! But when faced with the prospect of a real encounter, people sing a very different tune. Their idealism leaves them. Their romanticism is thrown into doubt. Their glorious anticipation is overshadowed with concern and anxiety. So when The Allies of Humanity message is presented, people begin to feel the real core of their fear, their lack of preparation, the weakness of their position. The Allies present a very realistic view of life in the universe. They are not here to answer every question that you may have, but instead to give you an awareness of what is really occurring in the world today and also to dispel much of the fanciful speculation that surrounds the prospect of humanity encountering other forms of intelligent life. Even fanciful expectation, hopeful expectation, really has fear at its core because you are uncertain, because you do not know, because you are unprepared, because you realize in a moment of honest recognition how vulnerable you really are, living on the surface of your world, exposed to the universe and undefended. Think for a moment if you were another race visiting your world and you wanted to just simply observe human behavior. Just observe it, without interfering. Well, you could look down on everything. It is all there. Human activity, human involvements, human conflict, human relationships, human technology, human communication-it is all available to the discreet observer. Therefore, it is very important to understand why people are afraid. The fear of the reality of contact is deep-seated. Many people have this very glorified view that they are at the pinnacle of God's creation, that their religions are built upon the pre-eminence of human spirituality and human identity. What will happen when they find out that humanity is one little race evolving within a Greater Community of intelligent life? And that this race is actually very weak, divided and insignificant in the vastness of the Creation! People's religious views cannot tolerate this kind of realization. Many of these views are already being eroded by the discoveries of science that show that the universe does not revolve around this world, that this world is just a little planet revolving around an insignificant star in a vast galaxy amongst many. Where is human pre-eminence then? Who are you in the universe? Are you really important to anyone or anything? We are asking these questions to bring you into the core of your anxiety because you must confront this within yourself. The inability or unwillingness to do this is really the source of all human ignorance and presumption regarding humanity's place in the universe and regarding the reality of the extraterrestrial Intervention that is occurring in the world today. People say, Well, there is no Intervention happening here. How ridiculous! It is all the fancy of certain people and their need for attention or their boredom or something. What are you really hearing here but an excuse? This is the way that one pacifies oneself from experiencing real anxiety. If you could consider this rationally and objectively, you would say, Well, of course we would be visited at some point! I mean, if there is intelligent life in the universe, someone out there must know that we exist here. And if you are not limited by the limitations of humanity's science, that opens the door to many more possibilities. If you can ask these questions, you might think to yourself, Yes, of course humanity will be encountered. Yes, our resources will be scrutinized. Yes, our world will be evaluated. Yes, there are other powers in the universe that would perhaps want our world to be part of their organization. And yes, they would want to take advantage of this beautiful place in some practical way. You see, these observations are so obvious. These speculations, if you could call them that, are so reasonable, but people will not consider them. They will not face them because of their anxiety, because of their fear. In fact, the reality of life in the universe, the encounter with life in the universe and the Intervention itself together represent the most denied reality in the world today. People will think, It is not important. I have my job. I have my family. I have, you know, my own daily problems. I mean, why should it matter to me? What are you talking about? If there is an Intervention going on in the world, do you think that it is not relevant to you and to your life and to what will happen to you? Do you see here? This is isolationist thinking. The Allies Briefings bring home the reality that humanity's isolation is over! But the isolationist thinking continues, unabated. Unless you have a direct encounter with forces from the Greater Community where your life is disturbed or upset in some way, well, you will just continue on thinking the way you have always thought, living upon the assumptions that you have always lived upon, oblivious to the greater realities that are shaping your life and destiny. And how can God reach you to tell you to become alert and aware, to make you responsive to these greater realities that are changing your life and destiny? People love the idea of a God out there that will throw them a life preserver when they are drowning, but the idea that God will interfere in their life and show them something they really don't want to see, well, that is really a test of faith, isn't it? That is exactly what is happening today. That is why the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality is in the world because this is God's message to alert humanity to this greater reality and to prepare humanity. The awareness is not enough. If the awareness engenders primary anxiety and fear, people will not know what to do. They will say, Oh, my God! What do we do? And they don't know what to do because they have never had to respond to this directly before. That is why God's message brings with it the preparation so people can begin to think like they live in a Greater Community. Then they can begin to become aware that there are Greater Community realities out there that are going to have a direct impact on them, their lives and their world.",
        "text_source": "The irony of Disclosure could well be that we will continue to have many unanswered questions about exactly who and what we are dealing with. We will have gotten to a point where we can prove to ourselves openly as a society that they are here, yes. But that is different from being able to grab hold of a live one for open study. Fighting the black budget world would probably offer the most hope on this matter, but it may well take an extended struggle to make that happen, perhaps many years. It is also quite possible that whatever bodies are being held make up only a small piece of the grand puzzle of what constitutes these Others. Very likely, the real action after Disclosure will be dealing with issues internal to our own society. It may well be that at least some of these beings have established a residence on our world. There is certainly reason to believe, gained from countless insider leaks and claims, that there is communication of some sort between them and the black budget community. There are also claims, and good reason to consider, that some of them have insinuated themselves into our society, perhaps even our power structure. Why would that be so illogical? On the contrary, it would seem to be entirely logical. They would know that humanity is on the fast track, and that when we get to the point where we might prove to be a genuine annoyance, all the more reason for them to have their own people on the inside. In the post-Disclosure world, this question will be raised more than once. There will be no easy way around it. Disclosure of the UFO reality will force our civilization to resolve many longstanding challenges and problems. Looking at only a few of these, it is easy to see why secrecy on this matter has been paramount for so long. Uncovering it will be the most revolutionary act in human history. The Long View   Looking further ahead into the future, we can discern some contours of that distant shore. It will be a world with an open recognition of the presence of other, alien intelligences here on Earth, interacting with this planet and humanity. That will be out in the open. Whether they will be out in the open is another matter altogether. But its open acknowledgement will be a great spur to our intellectual development. The dominant technologies a century from now will be difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to recognize today. Computing power and artificial intelligence will be orders of magnitude greater."

Their immediate visual impact is hard to ignore; even if we should quickly turn cynic, just for one brief moment we have been caught allowing ourselves to wonder. People often say that cynicism is born of a broken heart, perhaps in the case of the circles this is true. How many of us would truly love them to be the proof that we are not alone? Or confirm that we are in touch with something other than ourselves \u2013 a culture that might have wonderful things to teach us, wonderful stories to exchange. Perhaps we shouldn't be so dismissive of these forbidden yearnings or so harsh on ourselves. Perhaps mankind is lonely. After all, he appears to have no one with whom to compare himself, no other intelligent species with whom he can converse and share his wisdom, hopes, dreams, troubles and fears. The crop circles, however, do seem to speak a universal language; a universal philosophy grounded in the archetypes that define our consciousness and the whole of reality. The circles might then be accepted as a step towards understanding and grasping that which could, one day, allow us to enter into a meaningful conversation with others, about matters beyond our own self-concern.

        "text_target": "Therefore, it is necessary for you to understand the nature of conflict in the universe because this will give you insight into the visitors and their needs-why they function the way they do, why individual freedom is unknown amongst them and why they rely upon their collectives. This gives them stability and power, but it also renders them vulnerable to those who are skilled with Knowledge. Knowledge enables you to think in any number of ways, to act spontaneously, to perceive reality beyond the obvious and to experience the future and the past. Such abilities are beyond the reach of those who can only follow the regimens and the dictates of their cultures. You are far behind the visitors technologically, but you have the promise to develop skills in The Way of Knowledge, skills which you will need and must learn to rely upon increasingly. We would not be the Allies of Humanity if we did not teach you about life in the Greater Community. We have seen much. We have encountered many different things. Our worlds were overcome and we had to regain our freedom. We know, from error and from experience, the nature of the conflict and the challenge that you face today. That is why we are well suited for this mission in our service to you. However, you will not meet us, and we will not come to meet the leaders of your nations. That is not our purpose. Indeed, you need as little interference as possible, but you do need great assistance. There are new skills that you must develop and a new understanding that you must gain. Even a benevolent society, should they come to your world, would have such an influence and such an impact upon you that you would become dependent upon them and would not establish your own strength, your own power and your own self-sufficiency. You would be so reliant upon their technology and upon their understanding that they would not be able to leave you. And indeed, their arrival here would make you even more vulnerable to interference in the future. For you would desire their technology, and you would want to travel along the corridors of trade in the Greater Community. Yet you would not be prepared, and you would not be wise. That is why your future friends are not here. That is why they are not coming to help you. For you would not become strong if they did. You would want to associate with them, you would want to have alliances with them, but you would be so weak that you could not protect yourselves. In essence, you would become part of their culture, which they do not will. Perhaps many people will not be able to understand what we are saying here, but in time this will make perfect sense to you, and you will see its wisdom and its necessity. At this moment, you are far too frail, too distracted and too conflicted to form strong alliances, even with those who could be your future friends. Humanity cannot yet speak as one voice, and so you are prone to intervention and manipulation from beyond. As the reality of the Greater Community becomes more well known within your world, and if our message can reach enough people, then there will be a growing consensus that there is a greater problem facing humanity. This could create a new basis for cooperation and consensus. For what possible advantage can one nation in your world have over another when the entire world is threatened by the Intervention? And who could seek to gain individual power in an environment where alien forces are intervening? If freedom is to be real in your world, it must be shared. It must be recognized and known. It cannot be the privilege of the few or there will be no real strength here. We understand from the Unseen Ones that already there are people who seek world dominion because they believe they have the visitors' blessings and support. They have the visitors' assurance that they will be assisted in their quest for power. And yet, what are they giving away but the keys to their own freedom and the freedom of their world? They are unknowing and unwise. They cannot see their error. We also understand that there are those who believe that the visitors are here to represent a spiritual renaissance and a new hope for humanity, but how can they know, they who know nothing of the Greater Community? It is their hope and their desire that this be the case, and such wishes are accommodated by the visitors, for very obvious reasons. What we are saying here is there can be nothing short of real freedom in the world, real power and real unity. We make our message available to everyone, and we trust that our words can be received and considered seriously. Yet we have no control over your response. And the superstitions and the fears of the world may make our message beyond the reach for many. But the promise is still there. To give you more, we would have to take over your world, which we do not want to do. Therefore, we give all that we can give without interfering in your affairs. Yet there are many who want interference. They want to be rescued or saved by someone else. They do not trust the possibilities for humanity. They do not believe in humanity's inherent strengths and capabilities. They will give over their freedom willingly. They will believe what they are told by the visitors. And they will serve their new masters, thinking that what they are being given is their own liberation. Freedom is a precious thing in the Greater Community. Never forget this. Your freedom, our freedom. And what is freedom but the ability to follow Knowledge, the reality that the Creator has given you, and to express Knowledge and to contribute Knowledge in all of its manifestations? Your visitors do not have this freedom. It is unknown to them. They look at the chaos of your world, and they believe that the order that they will impose here will be redeeming for you and will save you from your own self-destruction. This is all they can give, for this is all that they have. And they will use you, but they do not consider this inappropriate, for they themselves are being used and know of no alternative to this. Their programming, their conditioning, is so thorough that to reach them at the level of their deeper spirituality holds only remote possibilities. You do not have the strength to do this. You would have to be so much stronger than you are today to have a redeeming influence on your visitors. And yet, their conformity is not so unusual in the Greater Community. It is very common in large collectives, where uniformity and compliance are essential to efficient functioning, particularly over vast areas of space. Therefore, do not look at the Greater Community with fear, but with objectivity. The conditions that we are describing already exist in your world. You can understand these things. Manipulation is known to you. Influence is known to you. You have just never encountered them on such a great scale, nor have you ever had to compete with other forms of intelligent life. As a result, you do not yet have the skills to do so. We speak of Knowledge because it is your greatest ability. Regardless of what technology you can develop over time, Knowledge is your greatest promise. You are far behind the visitors in your technological development, so you must rely upon Knowledge. It is the greatest force in the universe, and your visitors do not use it. It is your only hope. That is why the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality teaches The Way of Knowledge, provides the Steps to Knowledge and teaches Greater Community Wisdom and Insight. Without this preparation, you would not have the skill or the perspective to understand your dilemma or to respond to it effectively. It is too big. It is too new. And you are not adapted to these new circumstances. The visitors' influence is growing with each passing day. Every person who can hear this, feel this and know this must learn The Way of Knowledge, The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. This is a calling. It is a gift. It is a challenge. Under more pleasant circumstances, well, the need may not seem as great. But the need is tremendous, for there is no security, there is no place to hide, there is no retreat in the world that is secure from the alien presence that is here. That is why there are only two choices: you can acquiesce or you can stand for your freedom. This is the great decision placed before each person. This is the great turning point. You cannot be foolish in the Greater Community. It is too demanding an environment. It requires excellence, commitment. Your world is too valuable. The resources here are coveted by others. The strategic position of your world is held in high regard. Even if you were living in some remote world far from any trade route, far from all commercial engagements, eventually you would be discovered by someone. That eventuality has come for you now. And it is well underway.",

Changes of opinion and attitude toward us could occur over time. Wouldn't groups of people be one day tempted to consider themselves our equals, because we were not able to remain inaccessible? Protest movements would consequently arise and revolutionary cycles would no doubt be set in motion, as a result of which we, as well as our Herodian allies, would suffer. Our global policy would then be compromised and we would have to consider making our contacts less frequent and, ultimately, withdrawing onto our ships and retreating. We would then have the time necessary to review our policies, based on the still unknown techniques of our catechumens. The discovery of new worlds could enable us to enter into contact with civilizations just as developed as our own and even far more advanced. Nothing allows us to rule out the possibility that, ultimately, we would encounter explorers from other more distant worlds. Under these hypothetical conditions, it is permissible to imagine that we might have been discovered in space first. It would be our turn then to experience - at least in part - the psychological effects and the political and religious implications that we have described. What would be the policy of local governments toward us? Would they welcome us peacefully or would they prudently keep us at a distance? Should we fear seeing ourselves aim nuclear space weapons or other weapons against, for example, the bases that we had attempted to establish or had succeeded in establishing in the asteroid belt close to one of their worlds? What would be the results of such encounters? What relations could we establish and what influences would we exert on these different types of civilizations?"

        "text_target": "The Briefings provide us a clear picture of who we are encountering, what this means for humanity and how we can prepare for this-the greatest and most consequential event in human history. And yet these Briefings are also a gift, for they give us a window into the realities of life in our local region of space, a vision we could not have otherwise. The Allies are not here on our planet influencing our governments, our science or our religions. Instead they came to the vicinity of our world to witness the Intervention taking place on Earth and to provide us a series of Briefings that reveal vital information about what is happening, why it is happening, what it means and what we must do to prepare. The Allies are not giving these Briefings to governments or people in positions of power. They are giving these Briefings to the people of our world. The Allies contacted me in 1996 and presented their first set of Briefings in 1997 and 1998. This first set of Briefings was then published in the year 2000 as The Allies of Humanity Briefings: An Urgent Message about the Extraterrestrial Presence in the World Today. There was no further communication from the Allies in the two years that followed. The Allies contacted me again in December of 2000 with a second set of Briefings. Under great duress, they revealed that after the publication of their first set of Briefings, they were identified and pursued by the Intervention and needed to convey their second set of Briefings immediately. All six Briefings were given in one day. Eight years later, the Allies contacted me again with their third set of Briefings, now speaking from far beyond the world. All seven Briefings were given in one day in June 2008. And then eight years later came the fourth set of Briefings. They were revealed to me in October 2016, with all six Briefings given in one day. I cannot account for why there were such large periods of time between the Briefings. Perhaps it was the circumstances facing the Allies after they were forced to depart the vicinity of the Earth. Or perhaps there were greater events taking place beyond our world that involved the Allies' mission and those they represent. All told, these Briefings present a body of understanding and perspective that we as human beings could not obtain ourselves, given at a time of critical need as the foreign presence of Intervention in the world grows and becomes ever more influential here in ways that we can barely understand. For humanity is unaware and unprepared for this great threshold: our encounter with intelligent life in the universe, which is occurring not from our journeys into space, but from the arrival of those who have come here for their own purposes. I would like to give you an overview of the first three sets of Briefings and then speak about the fourth set of Briefings. The first three sets of Briefings reveal that humanity is not alone in the universe or even within our own world. With this, they reveal that there is an extraterrestrial presence in our world functioning here in a secretive manner affecting people worldwide.",
        "text_source": "Many civilian groups must have sensed this, for while I was chief of Project Blue Book I had dozens of requests to speak on the subject of UFO's. These civilian requests had to be turned down because of security regulations. I did give many official briefings, however, behind closed doors, to certain groups associated with the government--all of them upon request. The subject of UFO's was added to a regular series of intelligence briefings given to students at the Air Force's Command and Staff School, and to classes at the Air Force's Intelligence School. I gave briefings to the technical staff at the Atomic Energy Commission's Los Alamos laboratory, where the first atomic bomb was built. The theater where this briefing took place wouldn't hold all of the people who tried to get in, so the briefing was recorded and replayed many times. The same thing happened at AEC's Sandia Base, near Albuquerque. Many groups in the Pentagon and the Office of Naval Research requested UFO briefings. Civilian groups, made up of some of the nation's top scientists and industrialists, and formed to study special military problems, worked in a UFO briefing. Top Air Force commanders were given periodic briefings. Every briefing I gave was followed by a discussion that lasted anywhere from one to four hours. In addition to these, Project Blue Book published a classified monthly report on UFO activity. Requests to be put on distribution for this report were so numerous that the distribution had to be restricted to major Air Force Command Headquarters."

        "text_target": "Even human science is beginning now to acknowledge the preponderance of life in the universe as a theoretical probability. Yet who is concerned with what your first great encounters might mean? As The Allies Briefings are presented, there will be all kinds of denial, criticism and repudiation. Why? Why so much rejection over an encounter that everyone really considers to be very possible? Yet when it is actually accounted for, you will see a great deal of denial. Outrageous! Ridiculous! Cannot happen! You will hear scientists say, Well, it is not possible for another race to get here given the limitations of travel and speed and so forth. How presumptuous! Do human beings dare to presume what other nations and cultures have been able to develop over a long period of time? Is the universe limited by human understanding? Is it not possible that other races could have far surpassed human accomplishment in technology? You may say, Well, of course! But when faced with the prospect of a real encounter, people sing a very different tune. Their idealism leaves them. Their romanticism is thrown into doubt. Their glorious anticipation is overshadowed with concern and anxiety. So when The Allies of Humanity message is presented, people begin to feel the real core of their fear, their lack of preparation, the weakness of their position. The Allies present a very realistic view of life in the universe. They are not here to answer every question that you may have, but instead to give you an awareness of what is really occurring in the world today and also to dispel much of the fanciful speculation that surrounds the prospect of humanity encountering other forms of intelligent life. Even fanciful expectation, hopeful expectation, really has fear at its core because you are uncertain, because you do not know, because you are unprepared, because you realize in a moment of honest recognition how vulnerable you really are, living on the surface of your world, exposed to the universe and undefended. Think for a moment if you were another race visiting your world and you wanted to just simply observe human behavior. Just observe it, without interfering. Well, you could look down on everything. It is all there. Human activity, human involvements, human conflict, human relationships, human technology, human communication-it is all available to the discreet observer. Therefore, it is very important to understand why people are afraid. The fear of the reality of contact is deep-seated. Many people have this very glorified view that they are at the pinnacle of God's creation, that their religions are built upon the pre-eminence of human spirituality and human identity. What will happen when they find out that humanity is one little race evolving within a Greater Community of intelligent life? And that this race is actually very weak, divided and insignificant in the vastness of the Creation! People's religious views cannot tolerate this kind of realization. Many of these views are already being eroded by the discoveries of science that show that the universe does not revolve around this world, that this world is just a little planet revolving around an insignificant star in a vast galaxy amongst many. Where is human pre-eminence then? Who are you in the universe? Are you really important to anyone or anything? We are asking these questions to bring you into the core of your anxiety because you must confront this within yourself. The inability or unwillingness to do this is really the source of all human ignorance and presumption regarding humanity's place in the universe and regarding the reality of the extraterrestrial Intervention that is occurring in the world today. People say, Well, there is no Intervention happening here. How ridiculous! It is all the fancy of certain people and their need for attention or their boredom or something. What are you really hearing here but an excuse? This is the way that one pacifies oneself from experiencing real anxiety. If you could consider this rationally and objectively, you would say, Well, of course we would be visited at some point! I mean, if there is intelligent life in the universe, someone out there must know that we exist here. And if you are not limited by the limitations of humanity's science, that opens the door to many more possibilities. If you can ask these questions, you might think to yourself, Yes, of course humanity will be encountered. Yes, our resources will be scrutinized. Yes, our world will be evaluated. Yes, there are other powers in the universe that would perhaps want our world to be part of their organization. And yes, they would want to take advantage of this beautiful place in some practical way. You see, these observations are so obvious. These speculations, if you could call them that, are so reasonable, but people will not consider them. They will not face them because of their anxiety, because of their fear. In fact, the reality of life in the universe, the encounter with life in the universe and the Intervention itself together represent the most denied reality in the world today. People will think, It is not important. I have my job. I have my family. I have, you know, my own daily problems. I mean, why should it matter to me? What are you talking about? If there is an Intervention going on in the world, do you think that it is not relevant to you and to your life and to what will happen to you? Do you see here? This is isolationist thinking. The Allies Briefings bring home the reality that humanity's isolation is over! But the isolationist thinking continues, unabated. Unless you have a direct encounter with forces from the Greater Community where your life is disturbed or upset in some way, well, you will just continue on thinking the way you have always thought, living upon the assumptions that you have always lived upon, oblivious to the greater realities that are shaping your life and destiny. And how can God reach you to tell you to become alert and aware, to make you responsive to these greater realities that are changing your life and destiny? People love the idea of a God out there that will throw them a life preserver when they are drowning, but the idea that God will interfere in their life and show them something they really don't want to see, well, that is really a test of faith, isn't it? That is exactly what is happening today. That is why the teaching in Greater Community Spirituality is in the world because this is God's message to alert humanity to this greater reality and to prepare humanity. The awareness is not enough. If the awareness engenders primary anxiety and fear, people will not know what to do. They will say, Oh, my God! What do we do? And they don't know what to do because they have never had to respond to this directly before. That is why God's message brings with it the preparation so people can begin to think like they live in a Greater Community. Then they can begin to become aware that there are Greater Community realities out there that are going to have a direct impact on them, their lives and their world.",
        "text_source": "It has been said that every human feeling originates from only two basic emotions-love or fear. Love, the basis of compassion, sympathy, and understanding, stems from man's highest energy level, while fear, the producer of intolerance, hatred, and violence, comes from our basest energy level. Love, said to flow from God, is of the heart. Fear is a product of the mind. Unfortunately, too many religions focus on fear-fear of Satan, fear of death, and fear of the afterlife-to control members. All of humanity may be moving into a higher consciousness. Some call it Christ-Consciousness. There is no question that the old order-the old systems, the old ways of doing things-is crumbling. New dimensions, new realities are on the horizon. And each of us has a role to play. Mankind is only as strong as its weakest link. There are no victims or castaways. Everyone is involved. Each of us is like a tuning fork. When one resonates with the higher frequency of heartfelt love and understanding, others follow. Many feel that the aliens of energy and light, called the Tran-scendentals by the remote viewers, are here to witness-and perhaps help-our shift to new realities. It is literally a rebirth and, like any birth, there will be pain as we all move through the physical transitions. Fear will only make it worse. Yet, fear will continue to be a large part of our experience until we are able to break through the government secrecy and media-driven illusion of life to gain full knowledge of our world, our true history, our future, and our relationship with others in the universe. The advent of the UFO phenomenon on our collective consciousness in recent years may well be a wake-up call-a not-so-subtle message that human intellectual knowledge is not the end-all of existence or any assurance of peace and tranquillity. It won't be proven with a slide rule nor seen in a telescope. For true love and understanding, the basis for everything good and desirable, we must look inward. We all know truth when we hear it. It resonates deep within the individual being. We will know it by the subtle signals from the heart."

But other major nations as well will be contacted, for they are recognized to hold power, and power is understood by the visitors, for they follow the dictates of power without question and to a much greater degree than is even apparent in your world. Attempts will be made to persuade the leaders of the strongest nations to become receptive to the presence of the visitors and to receive gifts and inducements for cooperation with the promise of mutual benefit, and even the promise of world dominion to some. There will be those in the corridors of power in the world who will respond to these inducements, for they will think that there is a great opportunity here to take humanity beyond the specter of nuclear war into a new community upon the Earth, a community which they will lead for their own purposes. Yet these leaders are deceived, for they will not be given the keys to this realm. They will simply be the arbiters in the transition of power. This you must understand. It is not so complex. From our perspective and vantage point, it is obvious. We have seen this occur elsewhere. It is one of the ways that established organizations of races who have their own collectives recruit emerging worlds such as yours. They believe firmly that their agenda is virtuous and for the betterment of your world, for humanity is not highly respected, and though you are virtuous in certain ways, your liabilities far outweigh your potential, from their perspective. We do not hold this view or we would not be in the position that we are in, and we would not be offering our services to you as the Allies of Humanity. Therefore, there is a great difficulty now in discernment, a great challenge. The challenge is for humanity to understand who its allies really are and to be able to distinguish them from its potential adversaries. There are no neutral parties in this matter. The world is far too valuable, its resources recognized as being unique and of considerable worth. There are no neutral parties who are involved in human affairs. The true nature of the alien Intervention is to exert influence and control and eventually to establish dominion here. We are not the visitors. We are observers. We claim no rights to your world, and we have no agenda to establish ourselves here. For this reason, our names are hidden, for we do not pursue relations with you beyond our ability to provide our counsel in this way. We cannot control the outcome. We can only advise you as to the choices and decisions that your people must make in light of these greater events. Humanity has great promise and has cultivated a rich spiritual heritage, but it is without education regarding the Greater Community into which it is emerging. Humanity is divided and contentious within itself, thus making it vulnerable to manipulation and to intrusion from beyond your borders. Your peoples are preoccupied with the concerns of the day, but the reality of tomorrow is not recognized. What profit could you possibly gain by ignoring the greater movement of the world and by assuming that the Intervention that is occurring today is for your benefit? Surely there is not one amongst you who could say this if you but saw the reality of the situation. In a way, it is a matter of perspective. We can see and you cannot, for you have not the vantage point. You would have to be beyond your world, outside the sphere of your world's influence, to see what we are seeing. And yet, to see what we see, we must remain hidden because if we were discovered, we would surely perish. For your visitors consider their mission here to be of the utmost value, and they consider the Earth to be their greatest prospect among several others. They will not stop because of us. So it is your own freedom that you must value and that you must defend. We cannot do this for you. Every world, if it seeks to establish its own unity, freedom and self-determination in the Greater Community, must establish this freedom and defend it if necessary. Otherwise, domination will certainly occur and will be complete. Why do your visitors want your world? It is so very obvious. It is not you they are interested in particularly. It is the biological resources of your world. It is the strategic position of this solar system. You are useful to them only insofar as these things are valued and can be utilized. They will offer what you want and they will speak what you want to hear. They will offer inducements, and they will use your religions and your religious ideals to foster confidence and trust that they, more than you, understand the needs of your world and will be able to serve these needs to bring about a greater equanimity here. Because humanity seems incapable of establishing unity and order, many people will open their minds and their hearts to those whom they believe will have the greater possibility for doing so.",
        "text_source": "OPEN CONTACT? John L. Petersen served as a flight officer in the U.S. Navy and Navy Reserve and is a decorated veteran of both the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. His government and political experience includes stints at the National War College, the Institute for National Security Studies, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council staff at the White House. Currently he heads the Arlington Institute, a think tank based in Arlington, Virginia. We have met on a number of occasions over the years in Washington. In The Road to 2015: Profiles of the Future, one of three of his books he has given me, he invokes a possible scenario when open contact is made with extraterrestrials:  For  many  in  the  majority  segment  of  people  in  industrial  societies who  believe  that  UFOs  are  real,  this  event,  though  disquieting,  was seen as opening up the window to a whole new world and reality full of immense questions-but not all necessarily negative. There was wonder and questioning in the context of a desire to solidify relationships and learn more from these strange 'people.' At the same time, pockets of people (and some governments) reacted as though acutely threatened. The assumption was that these beings were coming to take over, or unduly influence, the world and that the appropriate response was to quickly build up corporate and individual defenses. . . .  All societies with access to television are transfixed by this event. Never- before-seen levels of global excitement and anxiety are experienced. The implications of this event cause an ultimate change in most every aspect of life on Earth. One of the hardest-hit groups are conservative religious organizations, for whom this event does not fit into their relatively narrow explanation of reality. This, perhaps the biggest event in history, causes religious leaders to scramble to explain (and in some cases, modify) theology to fit this new situation. Although some groups see the benefit of the new visitors in terms of new technology that can be made into weapons, many others see it as a hope for solving some of the very serious, intractable problems the world is confronted with at that time. Energy production is of particular interest. All of which may be true. But is open contact a viable scenario? We have learned that many types of aliens populate the cosmos-including Earth. A number of these races, such as those involved in the hybridization programs, definitely do not have our best interests at heart. And those who are on our side in such matters evince an understandable reluctance to engage with us en masse. We remain a relatively primitive bunch. As Daniel Fry, a pioneer rocket technician whose first encounter took place in 1949, was informed by his alien contact:  If we were to appear as members of a superior race, coming from above to lead the people of your world, we would seriously disrupt the ego balance of your civilization. Tens of millions of your people, in their desperate need to avoid being demoted to second place in the universe, would go to any conceivable length to disprove or deny our existence. If  we  took  steps  to  force  the  realization  of  our  reality  upon  their consciousness, then about thirty percent of these people would insist upon considering us as gods, and would attempt to place upon us all responsibility for their own welfare. Of the remaining seventy percent, most would consider that we were potential tyrants who were planning to enslave their world, and many would immediately begin to seek means to destroy us. If any great and lasting good is to come from our efforts, the actual leaders must be your own people, or it must come from men who are indistinguishable from them."

In other words, UFOs represent more than merely incredible technology, but a radically new understanding of space and time itself. Imagine what our world would be like if humanity learned how to master space and time. Could we travel, Star Trek-like, through the universe at warp speed? Could we somehow travel through time or into other dimensions or reality? There are many important questions nagging at our scientific community today. Are any of them better understood within the classified world in ways that have not yet reached the public realm? Keeping scientific secrets of this magnitude is not impossible and, as I will argue later in this book, has happened for a long time. In our world today, there are important unresolved questions concerning such subjects as the origin of life, genetic manipulation, disease, biological evolution, memory, consciousness, gravity, and other fundamentals about the universe itself. As astonishing as this may at first seem, a true understanding of the UFO phenomenon almost certainly has something to teach us about each of these questions."

Many of the beings that are being encountered in the world are bred by collectives to be servants. Their genetic heritage has long been lost to them. They are bred to serve, as you breed animals to serve you. The human cooperation that we are promoting is a cooperation that preserves the self-determination of individuals and provides a position of strength from which humanity can interact, not only with the collectives but with others who will visit your shores in the future. A collective is based upon one belief, one set of principles and one authority. Its emphasis is complete allegiance to an idea or an ideal. Not only is this engendered in the education of your visitors, but in their genetic code as well. That is why they behave in the ways that they do. This is both their strength and their weakness. They have great strength in the mental environment because their minds are united. But they are weak because they cannot think for themselves. They cannot deal with complexities or adversity very successfully. A man or woman of Knowledge would be incomprehensible to them. Humanity must unite to preserve its freedom, but this is a very different establishment from the creation of a collective. We call them collectives because they are collectives of different races and nationalities. Collectives are not one race. Though there are many races in the Greater Community that are ruled by a dominant authority, a collective is an organization that spans beyond the allegiance of one race to its own world. Collectives can have great power. Yet because there are many collectives, they tend to compete with one another, which prevents any one of them from becoming dominant. Also, various nations in the Greater Community have long-standing disputes with one another, which are difficult to bridge. Perhaps they have competed for a long time for the same resources. Perhaps they compete with one another to sell the resources that they have. Yet a collective is a different matter. As we are saying here, it is not based upon one race and one world. They are the result of conquest and domination. That is why your visitors are comprised of different races of beings at different levels of authority and command.",
        "text_source": "Meeting the aliens' goal of integrating hubrids into human society requires extensive training that begins when the hybrids and hubrids are children. The program's success depends on abductees, who are the designated trainers and coaches. While not all abductees are required to train hybrids, it is an important function for a significant number of them. Teaching Young Hybrids   Teaching human-stage hybrid children21 to act like humans is difficult. The lives these children lead onboard is almost incomprehensible to us. For example, hybrid babies are withdrawn from tanks, not born. There is no date attached to the event and, therefore, they do not know their own age. They have no identified father, mother, sisters, or brothers. They have no known extended family and no normal familial interactions. They cannot keep childish secrets in a telepathic society. They do not understand music. Because they have never lived on Earth, they know very little about almost everything human. Acting human requires subtleties of behavior that only humans can teach the hybrids. The volume of information they must learn to live in modern civilization is incalculable-perhaps too much for them to absorb or understand. Humans depend on relationships, friends, family, work, school, recreation, and legal, political, and cultural institutions, as well as a plethora of rules and norms that shape their lives. We live in a semi-privatized society based on love, family, work, money, recreation, justice, religion, and culture, all of which help to build a sense of self-worth within a framework of modified freedom. Humans are governed by laws and customs, both public and private, with specific sanctions for violating them. Although they acknowledge some rules, hybrids have almost none of this knowledge and structure. Everything must be taught to them. Hubrids grow up onboard in a collective society based on function, work, and duty. Free will is a meaningless concept for them. Independent activity and freedom of choice are severely limited. Love and affection, apart from that given by abductees, is probably not within their experience. Work and rules are everything. For hybrids and hubrids, life onboard is extremely circumscribed."

They need your physical stamina. They need your natural affinity with the world. They need your reproductive abilities. They also want to bond with you because they understand that this creates allegiance. This, in a way, establishes their presence here because the offspring of such a program will have blood relations in the world and yet will have allegiance to the visitors. Perhaps this seems incredible, yet it is so very real. The visitors are not here to take your reproductive abilities away from you. They are here to establish themselves. They want humanity to believe in them and to serve them. They want humanity to work for them. They will promise anything, offer anything and do anything to achieve this goal. Yet though their persuasion is great, their numbers are small. But their influence is growing and their program of interbreeding, which has been underway for several generations, will eventually be effective. There will be human beings of greater intelligence but who do not represent the human family. Such things are possible and have occurred countless times in the Greater Community. You have only to look at your own history to see the impact of cultures and races upon one another and to see how dominating and how influential these interactions can be. Thus, we bring with us important news, serious news. But you must take heart, for this is not a time for ambivalence. This is not a time to seek escape. This is not a time to concern yourself with your own happiness. This is a time to contribute to the world, to strengthen the human family and to call forth those natural abilities that exist in people-the ability to see, to know and to act in harmony with one another.

They perform their duties to fulfill the program's purposes and are all interconnected neurologically. All give allegiance to the insectalins.

They talk about sending aliens to Earth to live here undetected and eventually to supplant humans. Although the alien program is one of integration, exactly how The Change will take place is still a mystery. It is possible that integration into human society may merely be a preparation for The Change. If this is the case, then the program itself may be an ongoing integration into human society that will continue until the global population contains a critical mass of hubrids. In this case, The Change may be a final, as yet unknown, event or series of events that will culminate in the aliens' completion of their program.

        "text_target": " In order to understand the visitors' activities in the world today, we must present more information regarding their influence on world religious institutions and values and on the fundamental spiritual impulses which are common to your nature and which, in many ways, are common to intelligent life in many parts of the Greater Community. We should begin by saying that the activities that the visitors are conducting in the world at this time have been carried on many times before in many different places with many different cultures in the Greater Community. Your visitors are not the originators of these activities but merely use them at their own discretion and have used them many times before. It is important for you to understand that skills in influence and manipulation have been developed to a very high degree of functionality in the Greater Community. As races become more adept and more capable technologically, they exert more subtle and more pervasive kinds of influence upon one another. Human beings have only evolved thus far to compete with each other, so you do not yet have this adaptive advantage. This in itself is one of the reasons why we are presenting this material to you. You are entering a whole new set of circumstances that require the cultivation of your inherent abilities as well as the learning of new skills. Though humanity represents a unique situation, emergence into the Greater Community has happened countless times before with other races. Therefore, what is being perpetrated upon you has been done before. It has been highly developed and is now being adapted to your life and to your situation with what we feel is relative ease. The Pacification Program that is being implemented by the visitors is making this possible, in part. The desire for peaceful relations and the desire to avoid war and conflict are admirable but can be, and indeed are being, used against you. Even your most noble impulses can be used for other purposes. You have seen this in your own history, in your own nature and in your own societies. Peace can only be established upon a firm foundation of wisdom, cooperation and true ability. Humanity has naturally been concerned with establishing peaceful relations amongst its own tribes and nations. Now, however, it has a greater set of problems and challenges. We view these as opportunities for your development, for it will only be the challenge of emerging into the Greater Community that will unite the world and give you the foundation for this unity to be genuine, strong and effective. Therefore, we come not to criticize your religious institutions or your most fundamental impulses and values, but to illustrate how they are being used against you by those alien races who are intervening in your world. And, if it is within our power, we wish to encourage the right employment of your gifts and your accomplishments for the preservation of your world, your freedom and your integrity as a race within a Greater Community context. The visitors are fundamentally practical in their approach. This is both a strength and a weakness. As we have observed them, both here and elsewhere, we see that it is difficult for them to deviate from their plans. They are not well adapted to change, nor can they deal with complexity very effectively. Therefore, they carry out their plan in an almost careless manner, for they feel that they are in the right and that they have the advantage. They do not believe that humanity will mount resistance against them-at least not resistance that will affect them greatly. And they feel that their secrets and their agenda are well preserved and are beyond human comprehension. In this light, our activity in presenting this material to you makes us their enemies, certainly in their sight. In our sight, however, we are merely attempting to counter their influence and to give you the understanding that you need and the perspective that you must rely upon to preserve your freedom as a race and to deal with the realities of the Greater Community. Due to the practical nature of their approach, they wish to accomplish their goals with the greatest efficiency possible. They wish to unite humanity but only in accordance with their own participation and activities in the world. To them, human unity is a practical concern. They do not value diversity in cultures; they certainly do not value it within their own cultures. Therefore, they will attempt to eradicate it or minimize it, if possible, wherever they are exerting their influence. In our previous discourse, we talked about the visitors' influence on new forms of spirituality-on new ideas and new expressions of human divinity and human nature that are in your world at this time. In our discussion now, we would like to focus on the traditional values and institutions that your visitors seek to influence and are influencing today. Attempting to promote uniformity and conformity, the visitors will rely on those institutions and those values that they feel are the most stable and practical for their use. They are not interested in your ideas, and they are not interested in your values, except insofar as these things might further their agenda. Do not deceive yourself in thinking that they are drawn to your spirituality because they lack such things themselves. This would be a foolish and perhaps fatal mistake. Do not think that they are enamored with your life and with those things that you find to be intriguing. For only in rare cases will you be able to influence them in this way. All natural curiosity has been bred out of them and very little remains. There is, in fact, very little of what you would call Spirit or what we would call Varne or The Way of Insight. They are controlled and controlling and follow patterns of thinking and behavior that are firmly established and strictly reinforced. They might seem to empathize with your ideas, but it is only to gain your allegiance. In traditional religious institutions in your world, they will seek to utilize those values and those fundamental beliefs that can serve in the future to bring you into allegiance to them. Let us give you some examples, born both of our own observations and of the insight that the Unseen Ones have given us over time. Many in your world follow the Christian faith. We think this is admirable though it is certainly not the only approach to the fundamental questions of spiritual identity and purpose in life. The visitors will utilize the fundamental idea of allegiance to a single leader in order to generate allegiance to their cause. Within the context of this religion, the identification with Jesus the Christ will be greatly utilized. The hope and the promise of his return to the world offers your visitors a perfect opportunity, particularly at this turning point in the millennium.",

For power and domination; the intense desire to dominate and subjugate . There are thousands of good people on your planet, but the mean and selfish humanity outnumbers the good by millions and millions. Unless there is a radical change starting now, from an individual's mind, within a family and family relations, within a nation and between nations, your people will all be destroyed by their own selfishness for power and domination. Not until your humanity is completely wiped out will there ever be peace on Earth. The danger of atomic war between nations is imminent... It may not be now, it may be centuries from now, but the end will still come. There is no turning back for your people. Some day you will all be wiped out by your own greediness, and if a few good people live through, then they will propagate and breed an unselfish humanity and no longer will there be a continuous strife between nations, within a nation, within a family and family relations, and within an individual mind, and there will be peace on Earth at last. There is a great and possible danger, too, that your humanity's intense desire to conquer, eventually seeking power and domination over the other planets, will mean only a complete massacre for Earthmen, because other planets will retaliate with terrifying power and force, only because of their fear of your selfish humanity coming to their planets and spreading greed and evil around. This is our message. Transmit it and let humanity beware!"

        "text_source": "The intelligence that appears to be at work here simply does not operate that way. Despite its brutality, it is also subtle, inviting, re-minding, permeating our culture from the bottom up as well as the top down, perhaps opening our consciousness in a way that avoids a conclusion, different from the ways of knowing we traditionally require. It is an intelligence that provides enough evidence that something profoundly important is at work, but it does not offer the kinds of proof that would satisfy an exclusively empirical, rationalistic way of knowing. It is for us to embrace the reality of the phenomenon and to take a step toward appreciating that we live in a universe different from the one in which we have been taught to believe. There is considerable debate among investigators of the abduction phenomenon about whether, given the harsh and often terrorizing methods the aliens employ, the intelligence at work might be evil or mean us harm. Obviously in considering this question one enters a realm of interpretation that goes beyond the available evidence. We have only sketchy know ledge, for example, of what the hybrid \"program,\" which seems to lie at the center of the abduction phenomenon, is really about. Yet my overall impression is that the abduction process is not evil, and that the intelligences at work do not wish us ill. Rather, I have the sense that the abduction phenomenon is, at its core, about the preservation of life on Earth at a time when the planet's life is profoundly threatened. But although derived from the abductees' experiences, this view, admittedly, goes beyond the data and may reflect a bias, even a hope, of my own. What is the vision of the possible human future that the abductees have brought back to us from their journeys? UFO abductions have to do, I think, with the evolution of consciousness and the collapse of a worldview that has placed humankind at a kind of epicenter of intelligence in a cosmos perceived as largely lifeless and meaningless. As we, like the abductees, permit ourselves to surrender the illusion of control and mastery of our world, we might discover our place as one species among many whose special gifts include unusual capacities for caring, rational thought, and self-awareness. As we suspend the notion of our pr\ufffd\u00ad eminent and dominating intelligence, we might open to a universe filled with life-fonns different from ourselves to whom we might be connected in ways we do not yet comprehend."

        "text_source": "Do We Need to Know What's Happening? For abductees, understanding their situation can be psychologically important. Many abductees live in constant anxiety about what is happening to them, even though they may know the particulars of their experiences. Often, understanding the abduction phenomenon provides answers to lifelong questions about their odd experiences and allows them to move on with their lives, free from fear, worry, and obsession about abductions-even though the abductions continue unabated. When abductees come to me to help them remember, I cannot give them physical control over what is happening to them. I try to give them some emotional and intellectual control, but they can do little about stopping the abductions. There are several possible scenarios that could be realized involving public knowledge of hubrids living in society. The first is that there would be no public knowledge. People would obligingly do the hubrids' bidding and think nothing of it. Hubrids would live here and everything would go on as normal. That something is off-kilter would simply be disregarded by most people. If public knowledge were to become widespread, societal disruption could ensue. The idea that some people are actually hubrids could cause fear and panic. It could pit humans against each other. Suspicion and paranoia could run rampant in the early part of The Change, when most people are not yet incorporated into the aliens' structure. The concept of trust would be destroyed, as humans hunt for supposed hubrids to eliminate them. Even abductees might be imperiled. Because most abductees are unknown even to themselves, everyone would fall under suspicion. This is a nightmarish vision, but it might be a realistic one if society were destroyed from within through knowledge that The Change is happening. Another scenario could mean a smooth and unknown transition for humans into another species. In this scenario, people would not know what is occurring until it is too late-if, indeed, it is not already too late. Eventually, there might be a point at which people begin to realize that others can control their thoughts and actions. By that time, however, The Change would be too advanced to be stopped-assuming it can be stopped. Eventually, most humans might be in a close relationship with a hubrid and thus toe the line for their new masters. When that happens, freedom of thought, privacy, self-determination, and individuality would almost certainly diminish greatly, if not disappear completely. Knowing what is happening to us would be meaningless. The possibility also exists that hubrids, although loyal to the insectalins, could be seduced by human lifestyles and perhaps driven by human empathy to protect people. In this scenario, the evolution of the human race could mean the evolution of hubrids into humanity, the hubrids having been tempted into a free-wheeling semi-private existence that they have learned to enjoy. They would be humanized. But the central fact remains that they can control humans and humans cannot control them. That neurological inequality gives them free rein over humanity in every way. Resistance to them would be practically impossible, no matter which scenario ensues. For researchers, the question of choosing whether to know what is happening has other ramifications. I have struggled with this problem for many years. It is a close call, but my sense is that it is better to know than not to know. Without knowledge, we are completely at the aliens' mercy. With proper knowledge, we may think of options to delay or impede their program. I think this is worthwhile. And helping abductees struggle with what is happening to them is the human thing to do."

People want to think of it in other ways because it is easier to deal with. For goodness sakes, yes! Some people say, Oh, they are here because they need our help! They need our blood supplies. Or they need our religion and we will help them and we will feel so good about ourselves and they will be so grateful. Some people think, Well, they are here to bring us new technology and help us end pollution. Do you think people and governments would use this new technology in such a way? Nations in the world would step upon each other to have this new technology for superiority and strength because nations are competing with each other. Some people say, Well, they are here because they want to study us. Why would they want to study you? They could study you by receiving your transmissions, which are being projected out into space. Your information is very accessible. It does not require them to be here to study you. And why would they want to study you anyway? Why would so much time and effort be spent in studying human beings? Do you think this is a science project? Do you think this is a cultural exploration? Do people think that humanity is so fascinating, so marvelous and so remarkable that other races would spend this kind of time studying you? The only reason that races are studied is for economic or political advantage in the Greater Community. And these races are studied without their permission. Would you want someone to say, We would like to study you. Would you be our laboratory experiment for the rest of your life? We will try not to harm you. Would you agree to that? Especially if you found out that you were being used in order for your investigators to take advantage of everything you are and everything you have?

I get the feeling, though, that these-the ones that are still, still look alien-they still can't live here. I guess they can stay for short periods of time, then they have to at least go to their ships or something. But, there are parts of them that are with us because they have all these other people that are a mixture. Things won't go back the way they were-things will be better. There will be a lot different technology, and people can utilize their gifts. People will learn to get along better, at least these people have. There is more respect for the earth and all that's living. And, there is more love and acceptance ... more opportunity to realize good potential. The screen is fading....
